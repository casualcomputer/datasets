I have never been to Honduras and have no strong feelings about either side. The whole article is just a journalist describing a conflict between two groups of humans, while constantly using morally and emotionally negative language against one group and never sharing their perspective, while doing the opposite for the other group. This journalist doesn&#x27;t even accurately describe the origin of the conflict, which the top comment here does. It&#x27;s a fun mental exercise to read the article and count sheer number of Russell conjugations.<p>This is not the kind of document you write to inform your reader about the state of the world.\\n\\nThe version of the story without all the fnords: Honduras solicited investment in the form of charter cities, where corporations could buy pockets of land and run them however they wanted.  Then a more socialist government came into power, reversed the law allowing them to exist, and refused to give them their money back. The biggest, Pr\\u00f3spera, is suing to get their money back.<p>Worth noting, this is a standard risk in Latam and the government that introduced them made it a constitutional amendment with a ten-year reversal process, since they wouldn&#x27;t get any investors otherwise. The primary complicating factor here in Pr\\u00f3spera&#x27;s lawsuit is that they have not actually lost their investment yet; nine years to go.<p>But Honduras&#x27;s response is to withdraw from the court system and legal framework that Pr\\u00f3spera&#x27;s suing them in, the ICSID. If they actually go through with this, that&#x27;s going to be the end of most foreign investment in Honduras at all, charter city or otherwise. The ICSID is there to ensure that your investment stake won&#x27;t be confiscated by the government when political winds change; Honduras is withdrawing because it wants to do exactly that, and no investor will risk that happening to them.<p>Also despite the article saying &#x27;crypto&#x27; a dozen times their only relation to crypto is accepting it as legal tender, same as neighboring El Salvador. Instead of &#x27;DAOs avoiding the FTC&#x27; one should think &#x27;biotech avoiding the FDA&#x27;.\\n\\n  I wonder if all the huge manufacturing factories near San Pedro Sula&#x2F;Cortez will pack up and move to either El Salvador or Guatemala in response to this?\\n\\n  &gt; Honduras solicited investment in the form of charter cities, where corporations could buy pockets of land and run them however they wanted. Then a more socialist government came into power, reversed the law allowing them to exist, and refused to give them their money back.<p>No mention of democratically elected government being ousted by US-backed coup, or the fact that this single company is asking for a third of the country\\u2019s GDP.<p>On crypto: you seem very confident about your position, yet if you talk to actual people on the ground,  you\\u2019ll get a different story than you are proposing. Crypto advocates are bragging about this very subject. It started with El Salvador, but goes well beyond one country now.<p>And for the record\\u2026 I am not anti-crypto. I have been involved with bitcoin for 9 years.\\n\\n    A \\u201cUS-backed coup\\u201d is a bit misleading: Zelaya refused to follow the law, but the US didn\\u2019t back him - they tried to keep it from turning into a war before an election he was excluded from so the Honduran people could settle it democratically. I don\\u2019t like the realpolitik in avoiding recognizing his coup attempt as such but that\\u2019s not the same as backing him.\\n\\n      That is the narrative, sure, but is it the reality? Why would it ever be presented otherwise?<p>The US government refuses to follow its own laws.\\n\\n        It isn&#x27;t &quot;the narrative&quot;. The Honduran Supreme Court issues the arrest warrant. There was a congressional investigation that reviewed state department cables and found exactly what the part post is claiming.\\n\\n        <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_constitutional_crisis\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_constitutional...</a><p>Zelaya was constitutionally barred from re-election.\\n\\n          Post-coup\\n\\n            No, he was term-limited to the single term allowed by the constitution and was running anyway, with a fig-leaf of a referendum for a proposed constitutional convention to retroactively legalize the second term, the timing of which could never have allowed him to legally run for president. This was a \\u201cconstitutional coup\\u201d by the judiciary designed to prevent an illegal second term that was clearly otherwise going to happen.<p><a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Honduran_fourth_ballot_box_referendum\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Honduran_fourth_ballot_box_r...</a>\\n\\n        \\u201cNarrative\\u201d would be when you use \\u201cU.S.-backed coup\\u201d to describe a president refusing to leave office legally and the U.S. working to keep him out. There\\u2019s valid criticism that the U.S. should have been more aggressive in condemning it as a coup but none of the evidence suggests that the U.S. supported a coup in violation of Honduran law. The State department cables which were leaked show their focus was on preserving aid to people until a new election.\\n\\n  &quot;Political winds change&quot; like a US backed coup in 2009 that put the guy in power who made these laws? What international institution protects against that? Are countries bound by law if it was made by an illegitimate government?\\n\\n    Did you make an account just for this post?\\n\\n      Is that relevant to the question they asked?\\n\\n        yes.  this is an election year and GPT is a thing.<p>shillbots gonna shill.  this is a blatant one, which means it&#x27;s low-effort; here to stir the pot.  the real agi-prop effort will be a repost bot with a real looking history.\\n\\n          Nope. Real person, sorry! Yes i make a new account every time I lose my ddg session. Not llm spam. Just a very opinionated human&#x2F;dog\\n\\n    The only US involvement in ousting Zelaya was the State Department asking neighboring countries not to intervene. The Supreme Court of Honduras issued the arrest warrant for him on their own. It was an entirely internal affair until after they tossed him onto a plane. And on top of that, the guy was trying to illegally change the constitution.\\n\\n      It stretches credulity that the US wasn&#x27;t involved in some way. The state department had an opinion on what outcome they wanted [0] and it&#x27;d be out of character if they didn&#x27;t put their thumb on the scale as much as was necessary to get the outcome they wanted.<p>We don&#x27;t really need public acknowledgement to assume that the US is involved in American politics. If there is a coup in their back garden, they&#x27;ll have someone there doing some pruning.<p>[0] <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Documents_on_US_role\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9t...</a>\\n\\n        Yes, I&#x27;ve read the wikipedia article too. I was also studying Latin America in college at the time and can read Spanish so I was pretty closely following the issue.<p>Having an opinion on the outcome you want doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re actively putting a thumb on the scale or driving events. The State Department has a position on almost ever major political event happening in the world. It can&#x27;t possibly be intervening in all of them.<p>&gt; If there is a coup in their back garden, they&#x27;ll have someone there doing some pruning.<p>Except the US specifically stayed out of this and encouraged Honduras&#x27;s neighbors not to get involved either. If the US had chosen to support Zelaya, then the people backing the Supreme Court would have called that a US intervention.<p>Is your standard that having an opinion on a foreign political outcome is tantamount to intervention? If not what is your standard and how does it apply here?\\n\\n  TIL what \\u201cfnord\\u201d is. I think that is a perfect way to describe much of this article.\\n\\n    _The Illuminatus Trilogy_ , where I learned this word, is a fantastic read.\\n\\n  When Ukraine told Russia it was not going to pay back loans (prior to invasion) the West applauded.<p>Today the West is seriously considering expropriating external Russian property. Also apparently there is nothing wrong with this.<p>But when a small country in what is &quot;rightfully&quot; the US&#x27; playground threatens to protect its sovereignty from US corporations, apparently this is a whole different story.\\n\\n    The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. --Thucydides\\n\\n  &gt; Honduras solicited investment in the form of charter cities, where corporations could buy pockets of land and run them however they wanted.<p>Bioshock: Jungle Edition\\n\\nI read about these charter cities a few years ago [0]. All the theory around them seemed to have this libertarian zeal about it that kind of put the foreign investors ahead of the local, voting population. And basic government functions (voting, taxes, police) were simply ignored or not fully explained.<p>BTW, for the Americans, there are lots of charter cities going up in Puerto Rico. And they are also unpopular because rich foreigners pay lower or no taxes compared to a PR citizen.<p>[0] <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty&#x2F;308134&#x2F;?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-pol...</a>\\n\\n  Not all of them, these have led to real non-tourism job growth in PR. And PR is US territory, the tax breaks are for citizens who move from the mainland - not foreigners. It\\u2019s actually a great setup for software companies who are required to hire some locals.\\n\\n  Is this the latest incarnation of disaster capitalism? In the 00&#x27;s, companies were content to just capture the government and make it into what they wanted. Now it&#x27;s an explicit agreement that they can do what they want?<p>Those are real questions and not just snark, regardless of how snarky I actually feel about this entire thing.\\n\\n  I am cautious in supporting these particular cities, since democratic primacy is a critical right that empirically leads to better results. That dealt with, there is a frame here where democratic power is preserved. The idea is that voting is done with the feet. There are a lot of obvious ways that is worse than voting by vote, but it is a much more powerful action.<p>In the long term that sort of charter city would need to transition to either a more standard model or something like the City of London - eventually becoming a tightly controlled geographic area where not a lot of people actually live. It worked well for the UK, I imagine it would work well elsewhere. If anything, corporate control runs the risk of being too effective and ending up as the command structure of some sort of colonial superpower.\\n\\nHopefully Prospera wins and the socialist president loses. Honduras would benefit from more foreign investment. She&#x27;s not doing her people any favors.\\n\\nCrypto is [mostly] for crime, laundering, etc. When will the tech industry get past this?\\n\\n  Snapchat is mostly for porn?  Signal is mostly for drug dealers? Tor is mostly for pedophiles?<p>The early adopters of a technology are the users that need it the most, and have the highest opportunity cost from not using it.  You can think of them as beta-testers for the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; folks.  You are looking at the beginning of a technology and criticizing the beta-tester population.\\n\\n    The beginning? It\\u2019s been fifteen years. Hundreds of billions have been invested. We\\u2019ve been through several massive hype cycles.<p>If there is any potential for mainstream adoption of crypto, what exactly is holding it back at this point? It\\u2019s not new; it\\u2019s not obscure; and it\\u2019s certainly not underinvested.<p>Of course the crypto promoters will never admit that because the only reason to invest in crypto is this narrative \\u2014 \\u201cit\\u2019s something brand new, very few people understand it, you can get in on the ground floor and be part of a revolution, etc.\\u201d\\n\\n      It is easy to understand the use-value: sovereignty over personal digital assets; sovereignty over transfer of said assets\\n\\n        Nobody seems to actually want that though. Most crypto owners just trade on centralized exchanges.<p>In practice, that sovereignty jargon is just an ideological veneer over unregulated penny stocks with no product-market fit.\\n\\n          &gt; Nobody seems to actually want that though. Most crypto owners just trade on centralized exchanges.<p>I&#x27;m talking about what is important to me. I don&#x27;t pretend to know what others want\\n\\n    when was the last time you bought anything with crypto?<p>like you drove to 7&#x2F;11, got gasoline, a soda, and some chips, and paid with BTC?<p>how many people do you know bought a house with BTC?  Not a BTC investment that they cashed out into USD, but just BTC?<p>Snapchat can be used for non-porn; BTC isn&#x27;t used for anything.\\n\\n      Can be used to buy things illegally. Think ADHD meds or sanctions breaking.<p>In an ideal world, the ADHD meds where I live should be made available by GP prescription to reduce the backlog. Right now, it takes years to get a diagnosis free of charge, or to get a prescription for thousands of USD.<p>Of course, somebody (the dealer) will be left holding the bag after it unravels. But it&#x27;s rich to ask sufferers to put their lives on hold.\\n\\n  Never?<p>Its a far more efficient &quot;bug bounty&quot; system than the tech industry has ever created. Far easier to get paid far more with far less liability.<p>Its the ultimate PvP game. far more efficient game against people for resources than walled garden finance or <i>society</i> has previously created. It will always attract participants.<p>And that&#x27;s before even getting to the relativity of your nation&#x27;s laws. Are you suggesting we care about some other country&#x27;s capital controls because crypto use gets around those ... too? Is our go to response &quot;wait, that&#x27;s illegal laundering to move that much money... in China&quot;<p>Its only confusing if you don&#x27;t think about it.\\n\\n  Banks still [probably] have their place. But so does technology which gives me complete sovereignty over my assets.\\n\\n  By that argument we should also eliminate the internet, yes?\\n\\n  It is. That said, I know a bunch of people who use it to buy ADHD medication, who can&#x27;t otherwise afford to get a prescription in a timely manner. And I don&#x27;t even know that many people! I suppose there&#x27;s many downsides to enabling crime, but there&#x27;s some silver lining.\",\n          \"What made it pump this time anyway? It\\u2019s been weird because I don\\u2019t see a lot of buzz. Last big pump had every airport I visit and the Super Bowl plastered with crypto ads. This one has been virtually silent, which is either a very bullish sign or a sign that it\\u2019s manipulated and totally hollow.\\n\\n  ETFs, supposedly. I am pretty suspicious of anything that gets pumped up when it becomes easier for normies to trade it.\\n\\n  I think it&#x27;s the ETFs + retail investors.\\n\\n  Tron has whitelisted tether to mint USDT.\\n\\n  I could tell you, but then I\\u2019d be giving my edge away for free. There were 2 main catalysts. These catalysts repeat themselves though this time they both happened at the same time.<p>My investment buy signals have been on point but my favorite hold duration for any investment is &#x2F;forever&#x2F; if possible. I also invest in almost every asset class because diversification helps you protect your principal. That\\u2019s just my view and everyone has their own view.\\n\\n    There&#x27;s actually three main catalysts. It&#x27;s kind of funny that you only think there&#x27;s two :)<p>Although I don&#x27;t blame you for not knowing the third one. It&#x27;s really only known by people with a deep and sophisticated knowledge of the market, of which there aren&#x27;t many.\\n\\n      There&#x27;s actually four main catalysts. It&#x27;s kind of funny that you only think there&#x27;s three :)<p>Although I don&#x27;t blame you for not knowing the fourth one. It&#x27;s really only known by people with a deep and sophisticated knowledge of the market, of which there aren&#x27;t many.\\n\\n        Pride, greed, gluttony, envy, sloth.<p>Five main catalysts, and I&#x27;m giving them away for free\\n\\n          And a fanatical devotion to the Pope. Six!\\n\\n  ETF news were widely circulated by speculators -&gt; Giancarlo started his printing press -&gt; BTC value went up -&gt; ETF inflows increased -&gt; even more printing by Giancarlo -&gt; more inflows in ETF -&gt; loop continues for now....<p>Just as an example - the biggest and scariest fund in the world Blackrock had estimated 11 billion dollars inflows in the BTC ETFs. At the same time period, a single dude with the laptop in some non-extradition offshore has printed 12 billions just since the beginning of this year. And all of those printed tokens were immediately used to buy BTC and other volatile tokens. No wonder the the price went insane over past months.\\n\\nWhat I cannot understand is how the crypto market is supposed to be looked at in the context of central bank policy. Stocks are businesses, businesses can be understood in the framing of the economy, and inference can be had as it pertains to stocks (and collections of stocks) regarding that particular business and particular central bank levers. BTC and the like do no have these connections, so why does crypto even care? How should I be thinking about this?\\n\\n  There are narratives like lower interest rates -&gt; more money circulating -&gt; more speculation -&gt; crypto goes up. Or higher interest rates -&gt; crypto goes up as a hedge against inflation. This still leaves you the problem of deciding what model to use.\\n\\n  It\\u2019s about liquidity in the financial markets- lower interest rates means people earn less when the money is in a back. So, they are open to speculation outside of normal banking system.<p>It is also whales playing games too though\\n\\n&gt; The bitcoin price has crashed by over 10% since this time last week<p>Uh, yeah, back to the price of ~2 weeks ago, or just up 23% in the last month...<p><a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XbZ8zDpX2Mg?si=gSs3vJnYUNrcQVr6\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XbZ8zDpX2Mg?si=gSs3vJnYUNrcQVr6</a>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I also invest in almost every asset class because diversification helps you protect your principal. That\\u2019s just my view and everyone has their own view.\\n\\n    There&#x27;s actually three main catalysts.

At the same time period, a single dude with the laptop in some non-extradition offshore has printed 12 billions just since the beginning of this year. And all of those printed tokens were immediately used to buy BTC and other volatile tokens. No wonder the the price went insane over past months.\\n\\nWhat I cannot understand is how the crypto market is supposed to be looked at in the context of central bank policy. Stocks are businesses, businesses can be understood in the framing of the economy, and inference can be had as it pertains to stocks (and collections of stocks) regarding that particular business and particular central bank levers. BTC and the like do no have these connections, so why does crypto even care? How should I be thinking about this?\\n\\n  There are narratives like lower interest rates -&gt; more money circulating -&gt; more speculation -&gt; crypto goes up. Or higher interest rates -&gt; crypto goes up as a hedge against inflation. This still leaves you the problem of deciding what model to use.\\n\\n  It\\u2019s about liquidity in the financial markets- lower interest rates means people earn less when the money is in a back.

I do it every day. I&#x27;ve found this is the only way to actually protect your privacy.\\n\\n  I pity whoever owns nobody@nowhere.com because I&#x27;ve been using that for decades now\\n\\n    A sinister method is to state your birthday as Jan 2nd 1919. Just enough time to be remotely plausible. Bugs are sure to follow the account for the remainder of its existence.\\n\\n    I use fastmail with my own domains. I got a separate domain for myself that I use for trashmails.\\n\\n      I mean that&#x27;s fine, but you are the registered owner \\u300brenter of that domain, so you are linked to it in a database somewhere, even if your info is behind whoisguard-style obfuscation. Even if unlikely, should a dataset get exposed or the service stop functioning as intended, you&#x27;re linked. No real worry for singing up for future junk-mail, but risks escalate when employment is at stake.\\n\\n        That\\u2019s fine. If they can\\u2019t deal with my real opinion it\\u2019s better to end that working relationship anyways.\\n\\n    Pro tip: always use example.com because then you are sure you are not spamming someone&#x27;s inbox.\\n\\n      Sometimes form validation prevents that from working.<p>nobody@nowhere.com works 99.999% of the time\\n\\n    i can neither confirm nor deny that butts@butts.com has a wide presence on public wifi hotspots scattered across western europe.\\n\\n    That poor guy. He thought when he stopped using blah@blah.com he&#x27;d have it easy and look what happened.\\n\\n  No you can&#x27;t - they can still link which is the whole problem. The advertising industry has built such a tracking apparatus that some part of your system, maybe even your browser audio, is going to give up your fingerprint.\\n\\nI went to go log in to see what I had left there, first off it wouldn&#x27;t let me see the one review I had written, and second I&#x27;m now stuck in a &quot;community&quot; popup that won&#x27;t let me proceed without employment info.\\n\\n  Same here. I&#x27;m 100% sure I&#x27;ve added at least three Glassdoor reviews over the years, but after logging in, none are visible in my account.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if they got removed in their entirety, or if Glassdoor just disconnected them from my profile.\\n\\n  They made that change a while ago. When I first logged in and saw it, so began the illustrious Taco Bell food service career of Frank Offerman, known to his friends as &quot;F. Off&quot;.\\n\\n  I was able to bypass the modal by going directly to the account setting page: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;member&#x2F;profile&#x2F;accountSettings\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;member&#x2F;profile&#x2F;accountSettings</a><p>From there you can at least deactivate your account, not sure what other pages are also accessible without going through the modal.\\n\\nHm. Went to see if I have some long-forgotten account\\u2014yep! Try to deactivate account\\u2026 but it\\u2019s been so long since I logged in that they won\\u2019t let me do anything until I answer a bunch of stupid questions including <i>giving them my name</i>.<p>Sigh.<p>[edit] it said the name would be used for \\u201cverification\\u201d (?!?!) but a fake name worked long enough to let me disable the account, anyway.\\n\\n  Instead of logging in, file a data erasure request: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.glassdoor.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;privacyrequest?language=en_US\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.glassdoor.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;privacyrequest?language=en_US</a>\\nAll it requires is verifying your email.\\n\\n    I just did, and received an email for each review I ever posted, I guess they are taking my reviews down.\\n\\n  I just ran into the same thing. Using Chrome dev tools I deleted the overlays prompting me to enter info and that revealed the user menu at the top right. First, I changed my email address to a throwaway address since I doubt they&#x27;re deleting anything, and then I deleted it.\\nChatGPT thinks the direct link to the settings page is (or it&#x27;s just a hallucination, I&#x27;m not sure) <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;settings_input.htm\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;settings_input.htm</a>\\n\\nI don\\u2019t get it.<p>Is the point of this change to get real people to delete their reviews in favor of the \\u201cfake\\u201d reviews made by companies to suppress wages?\\n\\nWhy would they do this?\\n\\n  Class solidarity.\\n\\n    Money == Class Solidarity == Money<p>Gambling that human inertia leads to a platform with most of its original users but a much more scalable means to monetize them.\\n\\nHere is the form to delete your data and more: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.glassdoor.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;privacyrequest?language=en_US\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.glassdoor.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;privacyrequest?language=en_US</a>\\n\\n  I just went to the form.  It states:<p>By clicking the checkbox you are allowing &quot;Glassdoor to permanently delete or anonymize my data.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll bet you all the donuts they will not be deleting my data.\\n\\n    I don&#x27;t like that they carved out a massive caveat with &quot;or anonymized&quot; either. Just pointing out their standard process.\\n\\n    &gt; I&#x27;ll bet you all the donuts they will not be deleting my data.<p>If you&#x27;re in California (or the EU), I bet they will. Otherwise, you&#x27;re free to file a complaint with the Attorney General. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to have a federal CPRA?\\n\\n  Anyone else having form submission issue? I click &quot;submit&quot; but nothing happens.\\n\\n    I suspect their application may be hammered today.\\n\\n  I followed that link with two different browsers on my personal, one browser on my work-laptop - just getting a blank page.<p>Anyone else getting this? Any workarounds?\\n\\n    dooh! Switching to Private Window&#x2F;Tab does the trick.\\n\\nThis <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webworm.co&#x2F;p&#x2F;glassdoor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webworm.co&#x2F;p&#x2F;glassdoor</a> should have convinced anyone to go ahead and delete all their data and account from Glassdoor.\\n\\nBlind seems to be where tech people post reviews now. Non-tech people just use an alternative Google account and post the review on the company&#x27;s page Google Maps reviews page.\\n\\n  &gt; Blind seems to be where tech people post reviews now.<p>Yes. But if Blind starts doxxing its users, I think it will tank the industry. Lots of people are going to get fired.\\n\\nOh sure, when an individual doxes someone it&#x27;s harassment, but when a company doxes people it&#x27;s a growth mindset.<p>This should be illegal.\\n\\nThis is pretty plainly a terrible move, and might destroy them with lawsuits from the users who are able to show harm.  (Though I think most of those harmed won&#x27;t be able to prove it, nor even know for certain it&#x27;s the reason for specific instances of harm to them.)<p>Interesting is that maybe prominent among those harmed by this underhanded privacy violation are... us techbros.<p>And it&#x27;ll hit us where we feel it most, which is in our large salaries -- or lack of same, once we get fired for criticism speech on Glassdoor, and then HR hiring pipeline systems for some other jobs start denylisting our applications, for being a troublemaker who makes public negative comments about other employers on Glassdoor.<p>If experiencing this harm close to home -- to ourselves and friends&#x2F;colleagues -- translates into conscientiousness when we&#x27;re the ones making decisions about other people&#x27;s privacy, then that&#x27;s a silver lining.<p>More generally, you know how sometimes someone is harmed, and that person then goes on to harm others in the same way (as if inspired), but when a different person is harmed, they instead go on to defend others from harm (as if inspired)?  It seems the latter person is better for society.\\n\\n[dupe]<p>More discussion:<p><a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39761176\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39761176</a><p><a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39705788\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39705788</a>\\n\\nSo\\u2026 instead of moderating fake flowery reviews from the HR, doxing real honest negative reviews to scare away people from leaving those. Saves them a ton of money and headache on moderation, verification and also disgrunted customers(employers).\\n\\nBuried: 141.
