The parent project, lcl.host, has some annoying restrictions:<p>&gt; This CA has some restrictions though: it can only issue certificates for subdomains of lcl.host and localhost, but that’s all you need for local development.<p>Localias, on the other hand, lets you use any custom domain you&#x27;d like. And if you use a domain ending in .local, it will broadcast over mDNS so that you can easily connect to that server from any other device on your wifi network (like your phone.)<p>Localias also allows you to share your configuration with your entire development team by committing a .localias.yaml file to the root of your git repo. This makes sharing links with each other super convenient.<p>Always nice to see another competitor in the space; if you&#x27;re interested in this, please check out Localias as well!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterldowns&#x2F;localias\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterldowns&#x2F;localias</a>\n\n  Neat! I hadn&#x27;t seen this before, and it uses Caddy :D\n\n    Yes! Thank you for making Caddy, it’s wonderful software and it was really easy to extend!\n\n  Oh man, I was up and running in my project in less than one minute. Thanks!\n\n    I&#x27;m glad it worked for you and was easy to set up. If you run into any trouble or have any feature requests, please file an issue on github!\n\n  This looks fantastic! Does it support node extra ca cert etc? I’ve had that issue with mkcert in the past and it’s easy to fix but another thing to keep track of in these already complex dev setups if you’re doing local https.\n\n    I don&#x27;t understand what you mean, what is &quot;node extra ca cert etc&quot; and what is the issue with mkcert?<p>Localias wraps Caddy to handle all the cert provision; I believe Caddy uses mkcert. I haven&#x27;t seen any bug reports about yet, but if you give it a try and run into an issue I would be happy to help fix it.\n\n  This would be perfect if combined with Traefik&#x27;s method of config via docker tags.\n\n    The Caddy Docker Proxy Module enables Caddy to act as reverse proxy for docker containers via labels: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lucaslorentz&#x2F;caddy-docker-proxy\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lucaslorentz&#x2F;caddy-docker-proxy</a>\n\n      Whoa, thanks. I had my eye on Caddy for a local reverse proxy but can&#x27;t be doing with maintaining another big config file. With the labels method the reverse proxy becomes &quot;set and forget&quot; and you&#x27;re probably going to be editing bundled compose files to get rid of port conflicts anyway (or using override like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gpkb.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;multiple-web-projects-traefik&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gpkb.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;multiple-web-projects-traefik&#x2F;</a>)\n\n  &gt;This CA has some restrictions though: it can only issue certificates for subdomains of lcl.host and localhost, but that’s all you need for local development.<p>This sound like a security feature, not (just) an annoying restriction. Though an attack model for a local CA is a bit flimsy.\n\nIt surprises me how few people dev&#x2F;test against HTTPS, given that it isn&#x27;t exactly hard to setup manually (with tools like this making it even easier). Just point a wildcard DNS entry at 127.0.0.1 or some other useful address if your dev copy is actually not that local, and chuck a web server there acting as a proxy to what-ever apps, with a LetsEncrypt wildcard cert. It isn&#x27;t zero work, but saves time in the long run as soon as you hit unexpected issues caused by small differences between dev and prod.\n\n  You don&#x27;t even need to mess with a wildcard from Lets Encrypt, just use <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FiloSottile&#x2F;mkcert\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FiloSottile&#x2F;mkcert</a>\n\n    I&#x27;ve always been a bit wary of a local trusted CA, especially with the signing cert on the same dev box as the certificates it signs which is how I&#x27;ve seen things done a lot. It feels like opening up a trust issue that could allow an uncooperative entity to play games with me… Maybe that is just paranoia from the practical jokes played back in CompSci at Uni!<p>Admittedly an external attacker getting close enough to sign a cert using such a CA, in order to trick me into something, means they probably have such high access already that they don&#x27;t really need the CA to do that or worse, so perhaps it is unnecessary caution.\n\n      The way I handle this in the dev tooling I put together is to run a totally separate browser profile that (1) trusts the certificate and (2) can only connect to localhost. It also launches with a totally different colour scheme.<p>With chrome, that&#x27;s something like:<p><pre><code>    google-chrome\n        --user-data-dir=&quot;${HOME}&#x2F;.config&#x2F;ourlocaldev&#x2F;google-chrome&quot;\n        --install-autogenerated-theme=85,63,9\n        --host-rules=&quot;MAP * 127.0.0.1, EXCLUDE localhost, EXCLUDE fonts.googleapis.com, EXCLUDE fonts.gstatic.com&quot;\n        --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=&quot;0oKw9nasIS7qRQD1CYXe5bmi22&#x2F;mnHjZP++f6G+VM88=&quot;\n        &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.dev.thing&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis will launch a separate copy of chrome with a fresh&#x2F;separate profile. It will have a different colour (RGB values set in there) so it&#x27;s visually distinct when it&#x27;s running and I don&#x27;t get the windows mixed up. Any request made from the browser will be rewritten to connect to 127.0.0.1 (except a couple google font domains).<p>The danger if someone got their hands on my local key&#x2F;cert is basically nil. They would only be able to MITM connections from this one specific browser window to localhost. And that browser is incapable of connecting to anything besides localhost. I can never accidentally open my banking site in there. Also fresh profile so no saved passwords, credit cards, or anything else.<p>(As an added benefit, I don&#x27;t really need to worry about reconfiguring URLs for projects. If I open &quot;testing.mysite.com&quot; in that browser, it will force the connection to localhost, so I can just run my services at our test URLs and steal configs as-is from the testing environment. Taking it further, I then have a controller set up in k3s&#x2F;Rancher Desktop that rewrites the service on all annotated ingresses to point to its own service, which runs nginx, which the controller then configures to proxy the requests on to the local service or the actual upstream testing service depending on whether the local container is running. It also configures CoreDNS to point the upstream URLs at the same proxy. End result is that from the browser or anything running in k3s you can hit our testing URLs and it will hit your local container if it&#x27;s running or fall back to the testing environment if not.)<p>If you want to try the browser thing, you can generate the fingerprint for a certificate with:<p><pre><code>    echo &quot;&quot; |\n    openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -prexit 2&gt;&#x2F;dev&#x2F;null |\n    openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in &#x2F;dev&#x2F;stdin |\n    openssl pkey -pubin -outform der |\n    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |\n    openssl enc -base64</code></pre>\n\n        This is an awesome trick, thanks, I&#x27;m copying you.\n\n      I figure you could create the CA, have your browser trust it, create and sign your localhost cert, and then nuke the CA private key so no other carts may be signed.<p>It&#x27;d be annoying if you need to make a new localhost certificate, but totally manageable.\n\n      I think this is primarily FUD down by SSL cert companies.<p>If you have appropriate permissions on the private keys, it would require the same level of access to read the private key as it would for the attacker to create their own CA and install it on your PC.<p>My general rule of thumb is to use private certificates unless a) users interact with it directly, cuz they won&#x27;t install my cert, or b) financial or other highly sensitive data flows through it. I&#x27;m not convinced that commercial CAs are more secure, but for the price of an SSL cert, it&#x27;s worth it to have it not be my fault if something happens.\n\n    You don&#x27;t even need that. See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpatico.io&#x2F;devops&#x2F;deploy.sh#generateSelfSignedCert\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpatico.io&#x2F;devops&#x2F;deploy.sh#generateSelfSignedCert</a>() and also #generateRootCA()<p>Then point your server to the output files. If you want, you can also modify `&#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts` to point a &quot;production name&quot; to localhost (something I actually don&#x27;t do and never wrote a script for). Far fewer moving parts than the OP. (parts of Simpatico uses subtle.crypto and so requires https to run even locally)\n\n  &gt; It surprises me how few people dev&#x2F;test against HTTPS<p>For dev at least it’s mostly because web browsers treat localhost as a special domain that gets the HTTPS treatment even when loaded over HTTP.<p>I have set up local HTTPS certs before now, can’t remember exactly what required it. But I still load most web projects on localhost over HTTP just out of habit.\n\n    I&#x27;ve always thought the need for local HTTPS was unnecessary for at least 90% of the projects and brought no real value other than making the developer &quot;feel&quot; better.<p>localhost with HTTP should be sufficient for most things. It&#x27;s when you start doing stuff like &quot;app.localhost&quot; like what was mentioned in the article which, despite it having &quot;localhost&quot; is not the same as <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost</a>.<p>Develop basic in local and do all the hostname + https on actual server where you can easily do something like letsencrypt route DNS to it.\n\n      There are a number of APIs, such as geolocation, that only work over https.  It&#x27;s also very common to accidentally generate non-https urls for assets, which is a bug most people would rather catch in local dev and not production when the browser refuses to fetch them.<p>I use traefik to serve my apps in dev, which generates self-signed certs by default if you don&#x27;t hook it up to ACME.  Slightly more cumbersome because it means clicking through a warning screen and disabling verification in CLI tools (actually those are where I do drop to plain http).  I&#x27;m sure this lcl.host product smooths this process considerably, but when it comes to local dev tools, I have an absolute requirement that they actually run locally and don&#x27;t tether me to some cloud service, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with traefik regardless for now.\n\n        &gt; There are a number of APIs, such as geolocation, that only work over https<p>And localhost<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Secure_Contexts#when_is_a_context_considered_secure\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Secure...</a>\n\n          Might have changed, but last time I tried to use the Clipboard API it didn&#x27;t work on localhost without https\n\n            I would be very surprised if that were the case. Localhost gets special privileges in most browsers\n\n  It <i>is</i> hard to set up. Creating a cert and trusting it is easy – a Powershell script can do that in 3 lines.<p>But then, trouble begins. You have to configure every server to use the certificate (or use a proxy) and every client to accept the certificate. Sometimes the proxies eat headers, or they have trouble with WebSockets and hot reloading or whatever.<p>We also use IPs instead of domains to find our locally running prod servers so that our customers don&#x27;t have to configure anything DNS on their maybe-offline WiFi network. We also have to test with external devices, such as iPads. How do you automate getting your certificate onto them?<p>..And then your IP changes and all is lost again.<p>Yeah, if you have a 50 line Svelte &quot;app&quot; that you serve as site it&#x27;s easy. But who does that?\n\n    <i>&gt; It</i> is <i>hard to set up.</i><p>Really?<p><i>&gt; You have to configure every server to use the certificate</i><p>A couple of lines in apache&#x2F;nginx&#x2F;other config? The same lines each time. You probably don&#x27;t want your dev box to be doing things required for LE renewal (allowing external in for HTTP(S) validation, making public DNS changes for DNS01, …) but I have a small container doing that and other boxes pull the resulting cert from there (a small cron task, again the same in each instance).<p><i>&gt; and every client to accept the certificate</i><p><i>&gt; external devices, such as iPads. How do you [get] your certificate onto them?</i><p>I suggested using a public name and an LE cert or similar. Clients will trust without extra effort.<p><i>&gt; We also use IPs instead of domains</i><p>I did say “more devs don&#x27;t” not “all devs don&#x27;t”, there will of course be special cases. Though using addresses rather than names just feels broken.<p><i>&gt; And then your IP changes and all is lost again</i><p>That is an argument against using address based config rather than name based config, not an argument against using HTTPS!\n\n  I never work locally. Always remote. Dev.xxx.com, stg.xxx.com etc\n\n    Whether you dev&#x2F;test on localhost or a remote instance (or a local instance with a public name etc.), is separate from whether your dev&#x2F;test instances present via HTTPS.\n\n      Its a bit easier to use letsencrypt on a remote host. In less than 5 minutes i can setup a remote host with domains and certificates attached to it. Localhost with certs and hostnames is always a pita. Thats why i always work on a remote box. For my local editors it doesnt matter. Just attach remote disks to my local machine.\n\n        I think the relevant part here is that remote hosts have public IPs. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re doing HTTP-01 verification on Lets Encrypt, which does basically require a public IP.<p>FYI, you can get Lets Encrypt certs easily on non-public hosts by using the DNS-01 challenges. They rely on setting particular DNS records rather than HTTP responses, so they don&#x27;t rely on public IPs\n\nHow is this different from something like Caddy which supports <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost</a> instead of something like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lcl.host\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lcl.host</a>\n\n  localhost gives you a different security context in your browser than using a full domain name. Typically to use a full domain name locally you&#x27;d either need to mess with &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts (which can bite you later) or mess with DNS. lcl.host just makes things work out of the box.\n\n    Let me add a bit of clarification here, since you specifically asked about <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost</a><p>Using http with localhost is a mostly security context, but it has some quirks[0]. Using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost</a> will give you the full security context but then you&#x27;re typically stuck either dealing with certs manually or using a proxy, like caddy. lcl.host should simplify your setup.<p>We&#x27;re big fans of caddy by the way and even sponsor the project. Matt&#x27;s doing amazing work over there.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;when-to-use-local-https\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;when-to-use-local-https</a>\n\n      Thanks! That reminds me we need to get your logo on our new homepage. I&#x27;ll shoot you an email.\n\nI don&#x27;t see OrbStack mentioned here much, but it&#x27;s completely replaced Docker Desktop for me. Aside from having a better UI, faster and uses less battery, it also gives local https with custom domains for free [0].<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.orbstack.dev&#x2F;features&#x2F;https\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.orbstack.dev&#x2F;features&#x2F;https</a>\n\n  If you don&#x27;t need a GUI, the following combo works pretty well:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abiosoft&#x2F;colima\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abiosoft&#x2F;colima</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterldowns&#x2F;localias\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterldowns&#x2F;localias</a>\n\n  It looks nice, but it is MacOS only, and it is really expensive at $96 per year! Probably why it doesn&#x27;t get mentioned often.\n\n  OrbStack was mentioned often with all the Docker Desktop &#x2F; Docker open-source organization drama in the last year or two. But that was when it was free for all, now it&#x27;s paid for commercial licenses which is less attractive for organizations to switch over. We&#x27;re all on Colima. But the local https feature is a nice little feature for sure.\n\nI want to point out that Anchor.dev sponsors the Caddy project and we&#x27;re very grateful for that! Anchor devs have also made code contributions to Caddy and CertMagic.<p>Anchor has a neat product. They&#x27;re making internal TLS more accessible to more developers who don&#x27;t necessarily need a separate web server. They&#x27;re doing local TLS just about as best as possible from what I can see.<p>IMO this has more utility than mkcert -- which is a great tool by Filippo and Caddy shares some of its underlying library for its own auto-trusted internal CA -- because, like Caddy, Anchor fully automates the certificates instead of just generating them and needing a cron job. It&#x27;s more hands-off and higher-level, allowing you to get more done with less effort.\n\nWarning: This checks if it’s running the latest version and refuses to run if it isn’t up to date. They just released v0.0.16 15 minutes ago and the update hasn’t hit Homebrew yet, so it has completely disabled itself and won’t run. There doesn’t seem to be any option to skip the version check.<p>So don’t use this unless you don’t mind it breaking randomly whenever there’s an update.\n\n  When I first announced Caddy, our website downloaded everything as .gz due to high traffic load --  a lesson I learned very quickly and a mistake I never made again.<p>This probably falls in the same boat. :)\n\n    Sorry, maybe it&#x27;s too early in the day but I don&#x27;t get what the lesson was. Could you explain?\n\n      (IMHO) the lesson is that sometimes you&#x27;re excited to tell the world about what you built, that you forget about some &quot;other stuff&quot;<p>i.e. I don&#x27;t think that the authors of this tool wanted to have developers be forced to use the latest version of their tool.<p>It&#x27;s probably that they didn&#x27;t think about it when they wrote the code, but now they know and hopefully this gets fixed in the next release?\n\n        Yeah, exactly. A lot goes into shipping, and sometimes things like this can be overlooked, especially on a small team that needs to deliver broad platform support right out of the gate.<p>There are some bugs that are just hard to find until they&#x27;re out there.\n\n        I just don&#x27;t understand what the thing about &quot;downloading everything as .gz&quot; means. It&#x27;s not like a gz is a rare file format, it seems like a totally reasonable format to download something in.\n\n          To clarify, every page load (.html file) was downloaded as a .gz file instead of being served as an HTML file and displayed as a web page in the browser.\n\n          Having once made a similar mistake myself, I assume what they mean is that it was downloading <i>everything</i> as a .gz—that is, the browser was asking users “where would you like to save index.html.gz?” instead of showing the homepage. (This happens when you precompress a static site for performance, but forget to tell the server that gzip should be negotiated as a Content-Encoding instead of a Content-Type.)\n\n    When we first release cdnjs.com we used tools to check if the DNS had fully propagated... but it hadn&#x27;t. The shame of a cdn being down in several places across the globe.\n\n  Gross. Thanks for the heads up!\n\n    Not affiliated with them, but it seems this was a mistake. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39768685\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39768685</a> -- maybe give it another shot?\n\n    They fixed this. It&#x27;s now a warning.\n\n  Sorry about that, we&#x27;re working on switching this to a warning and not an error, that slipped by us before release. After the next update, it will only show a warning if you&#x27;re not on the latest release.\n\n    We just released a fix for the version error, this will be the last one you see, we promise!\n\n      How about being able to disable the check entirely? I really dislike tools phoning home unless asked.\n\n      Thanks. The upgrade command v0.0.15 gives didn’t work for me. In fact the only method I found that would successfully update was to uninstall it, then untap your tap, then reinstall.<p>Also, I echo the other people saying that the typeface you chose for the website is very difficult to read.\n\n  That&#x27;s an absurd tactic I&#x27;ve not seen since last time I used Firefox.\n\n    you&#x27;re completely free to run firefox from 5 years ago and it will not refuse to run.\n\n      No, you are not.<p>Mozilla bricked SSL certificates that are mandatory for everything, including Browser Extensions.<p>There is a flag for about:config to unbrick it. Problem is though, that this lasts less than a second because of the remote settings service running in a loop. If you block that services domain with a host firewall (like opensnitch), Firefox will do an endless for loop using 100% CPU load trying to request the shavar and other services domains.<p>So, effectively, you cannot run an old Firefox version, and especially not a version that uses the old bundled mozilla certificate (which is all provided download variants).<p>That&#x27;s what the previous commenter was (likely) referring to.\n\n        Just for the fun I went to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.mozilla.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;releases&#x2F;53.0&#x2F;linux-x86_64&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.mozilla.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;releases&#x2F;53.0&#x2F;linux-x86_...</a> and downloaded Firefox 53 from 2017.<p>Font are ugly but it loaded HN just fine.\n\n          &gt; you&#x27;re completely free to run firefox from 5 years ago<p>&gt; Firefox 53 from 2017<p>not the same. I was talking about post-quantum Firefox releases, which added the mentioned dependencies on Mozilla&#x27;s SSL certificate.<p>(The grandparent&#x27;s comment was also about post-quantum, obviously)\n\n            The grandparent post is about some malicious tactic used by Mozilla to prevent you from using old Firefox releases. I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that there isn&#x27;t such intent - if there was, the very least Mozilla would have done is preventing you from downloading old versions from their own servers. Having a few specific releases that broke over time doesn&#x27;t mean anyone is trying to stop you from using an older version of Firefox. It&#x27;s basically called software.\n\n              &gt; Having a few specific releases that broke over time doesn&#x27;t mean anyone is trying to stop you from using an older version of Firefox.<p>Snakeoil certificates in Enterprise licensing might disagree with this statement, which in my opinion is pretty identical to Mozilla&#x27;s approach to have control over &quot;who is allowed to use when&quot; of their software.<p>It&#x27;s also not a few specific releases over time, it&#x27;s all releases after Browser Extension signatures were introduced as being mandatory, which made the rest of the Browser rely heavily on their certificate management servers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s malicious intent, what I am saying is that this could&#x27;ve been implemented in a much better manner, which wouldn&#x27;t rely on a centralized certificate signing service.\n\n                Yeah they don&#x27;t _have to require SSL_ but I think we can agree that is a worse thing given the benefits of securing extensions and validation of the server hosting them\n\nIn my experience a lot of developers ignore the concept of dev&#x2F;prod parity like this because a different team (ex. Deployment) ends up dealing with the integration issues it causes. That being said, its also traditionally a balance between effort and output - so I can see a &quot;make it easier&quot; tool like this helping lower the barrier to actually get devs to use it.\n\nCongratulations on shipping!<p>Just yesterday, I needed it for a hackathon, but had to switch to a cloud IDE instead.\n\nWhy modify the trust stores with the personal CA? Is there any risk to just publishing a globally valid wildcard cert for *.lcl.host, since it always resolves to 127.0.0.1 anyway?\n\n  We install the CA certificates into the trust stores so that the certificates are trusted by your browsers and clients, otherwise they will (rightfully!) get connection errors. We also set the CAA records for all lcl.host subdomains to anchor.dev, so no public CA will issue certificates for *.lcl.host. The only valid certs for lcl.host subdomains you will encounter are for your account&#x27;s CAs. If we gave everyone a cert+key for *.lcl.host, besides the security concerns, we&#x27;d have to keep redistributing them every ~45 days, but with lcl.host you can setup ACME to automatically renew certs before they expire.\n\n  Some sites have tried this before, but I dont think they stay online long. The certificates are &quot;leaked&quot; when they are shared, so the CA will revoke them.<p>I think a better approach is to get a domain name and a Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate. There&#x27;s lots of tooling for this, and it matches production. I built <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlocalcert.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlocalcert.net&#x2F;</a> to act as free, Let&#x27;s Encrypt compatible subdomain service specifically for these sorts of challenges.\n\n    Cool. I was hoping something like this existed, and glad to see you got it into the public suffix list. I&#x27;d been considering doing something like it for some time.\n\nWe built something similar for docker-compose based projects: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;hukudo&#x2F;ingress\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;hukudo&#x2F;ingress</a>\n\nWere some bugs that show only in the https version of the app?\n\n  These tend to manifest themselves when you have mixed content on the page or you&#x27;re using CORS. For CORS the issues can surface due to running different rules for dev vs prod&#x2F;stg.\n\n  HTTP&#x2F;2 quirks, e.g. header capitalization.<p>I think I&#x27;ve seen some different cache behaviors.<p>Secure cookies (and maybe same&#x2F;cross site stuff?)\n\nI&#x27;ve used this service in the past, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;local-ip.co&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;local-ip.co&#x2F;</a> which provides downloadable private key and certs and they run a dns service that resolves to any IP address.\n\n&quot;Try for free&quot;, no mention of pricing anywhere.. I&#x27;ll stick to what I&#x27;m already doing that&#x27;s free.. :D\n\nI&#x27;ve just got me a domain and am using letsencrypt. The hostnames resolve to LAN addresses. Still unsure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.\n\nOff topic but I find this font for the body very hard to read.\n\nCan you not use Letsencrypt locally? I think I actually saw something about that recently here on HN.<p>What is the difference between this and LE if true?<p>I would like to use a .test domain. I use that currently and just click &quot;proceed anyway&quot; whenever the warning pops up and It&#x27;s pretty often lately.\n\nJust use orbstack, it gives you https and hostnames.<p>Shameless plug: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrz&#x2F;container-shell\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrz&#x2F;container-shell</a> in combination with orbstack. Isolated dev environment, easy to use, local tools, https on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xxxxx.orb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xxxxx.orb</a>\n\nI’m skimming the docs looking for how “in containers” is handled and so far I can only see a one liner in the release notes. One problem in local environments I keep having and building tricks for is for services inside containers getting certs for other containers. From within the container, resolving to 127.0.0.1 isn’t helpful as that’s the internal loopback not the host.\n\n  we&#x27;re going to say more about how lcl.host works between containers in the future since it ends up pulling in Anchor&#x27;s package features, but I can give a quick rundown of what we&#x27;ve done in the past with docker-compose: start a service in container A and expose port 44300, and configure the service with an ACME client to provision a `service-a.lcl.host` certificate. The clients in that container won&#x27;t trust the cert, but that no problem, since your system&#x2F;browser will trust the cert if you&#x27;ve run `anchor lcl`. In container B, install an anchor built package for the language of the server, and setup the HTTPS&#x2F;TLS client to use the set of CAs in that package. Now app B can connect to `service-a.lcl.host:443300` over HTTPS&#x2F;TLS.\n\n    “Clients in that container won’t trust the cert”. Yeah, there’s the trick.<p>“service-a.lcl.host:443300“ so when inside the container, won’t that resolve to 127.0.0.1 which is the container internal loopback interface not the docker host’s interface? Hence trying to connect to itself not its sibling.\n\n      right it&#x27;s the loopback, but I believe docker-compose can forward loopback ports to the host (and then back into the other container) using links, but i&#x27;m fuzzy on the details and may be misremembering.\n\nI have another personal solution [0]. It&#x27;s a DNS server that also gets a wildcard certificate and make it available with a secret. This is definitely in the convenience over security relm, but it resolve any pattern prefix-123-123-123-123-suffix.example.com to the enclosed ip (e.g. 123.123.123.123). It will resolve to 127.0.0.1 or any other ip happily. Now you just need to use the associated cert and enjoy https. Works great from with k8s ingress, caddy, node.. You don&#x27;t have to fiddle with your trusted store and it works for everybody. I took inspiration from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nip.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nip.io&#x2F;</a> for the dns part.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpambrun&#x2F;dnsssl\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpambrun&#x2F;dnsssl</a>\n\nI&#x27;m on Windows 11 and not sure if it is just me but your font is too hard to read. I thought it was just the blog but no, it&#x27;s everywhere even on the landing page.\n\nHow do I get this working if we are 100% docker?\n\nSome things I learned about trusted localhost HTTPS:<p>* Windows is the easiest... by far.  There is only one trust store and its extremely easy to access at different levels of trust.  Firefox has its own trust store so you can either add your certs to both the Windows store AND the Firefox trust store or flip a config in Firefox to tell it to use the Windows trust store like everyone else.<p>* Linux is a challenge because you have to add your certificates to the OS trust store and then each browser has their own trust stores.<p>* MacOS is pretty close to impossible, at least fully automated.  If the cert is not registered with a third party of the OS&#x27;s choosing the cert will not be trusted in the browser.  The way around this is to manually add your localhost cert chain to the MacOS keychain.<p>If anybody wants an example here is something I wrote a ways back in JS (but please be warned its specific to my application:<p>* Build the certificate chain - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;terminal&#x2F;commands&#x2F;library&#x2F;build.ts#L403-L511\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master...</a><p>* Install the cert by OS type - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;terminal&#x2F;commands&#x2F;library&#x2F;build.ts#L403-L511\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master...</a><p>That second sample also installs pcap so that I can serve on localhost over ports 80&#x2F;443.\n\n  &gt; * Linux is a challenge because you have to add your certificates to the OS trust store and then each browser has their own trust stores.<p>I could be wrong, but I could have sworn Firefox trusts the OS&#x27; certificate store. Maybe it&#x27;s just been too long since I&#x27;ve done it.\n\n    Firefox has its own cert store, even on Windows.  You can make it defer to the OS trust store with an option in the about:config.\n\n      Yeah, I know about that part, but I could have sworn that Firefox on Ubuntu trusts the intersection of it&#x27;s trust store and the OS trust store (with Firefoxs store having priority).<p>Were you using the package manager packages? I&#x27;m a little surprised if the distro packages don&#x27;t configure Firefox to use the OS trust store. I would not be surprised if the binaries Firefox provides directly don&#x27;t trust the OS package store. They probably shouldn&#x27;t, given that the path to the OS trust store is configurable. I think Ubuntu and Fedora use slightly different paths.<p>Seems like a security nightmare to try guessing at what directory has the OS trust store. Better to leave it to the package maintainers to specifically customize it for their distro&#x27;s patterns.\n\nI just use cloudflare tunnels (cloudflared) - don&#x27;t have to install any certificates, it&#x27;s all handled by cloudflare. Yes, it exposes globally, but that&#x27;s often convenient to share a link to my dev with colleagues. And it has been fast enough. Downside is that you need internet connectivity.\n\nAny reason why these tools usually don&#x27;t support windows ? Is it harder on Windows ?\n\nI was working on something similar with <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpendery&#x2F;wock\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpendery&#x2F;wock</a>. Never finished it up, but this looks promising\n\nThe inline code formatting is making my eyes bleed....\n\nI&#x27;ve been using mkcert for ages now for local development. Free, open source, and works offline.<p>Why use any service for this?\n\nThey lost me at &quot;Signin to Anchor.dev&quot;.\n\nAny plans to add it to the public suffix list?"

      "conversation_text": "I am fascinated they used 60 pounds and a large amount of space for this teleprinter. At 30K per pound of payload that is $1.8 million per flight. Really shows how important reliable printed updates were considered.<p>And all the flaws of the printer that were managed around - turning it off to save power and prevent it overheating with specific tones.\n\n  I was pretty stuck by that, too, and it made me wonder if maybe I don&#x27;t understand or underestimate the value of paper transmission. I suppose if radio communication is good but flaky, or for persistence of instruction, like procedures, then it would be good for them to be able to print. But at such a cost!\n\n    I guess with modern googles one would just pack an &quot;ipad&quot; equivalent tablet. If one worries about accidents and freak space particles disabling it give them 3. If one still worries one can develop a &quot;space rated&quot; tablet. But probably at those radiation levels one should also start worrying about the crew&#x27;s health.<p>But of course that is projecting our current capabilities back in time. I looked it up and the &quot;Osborne 1&quot; portable computer[1] was just released 9 days before the shuttle&#x27;s first flight. It weighed 24.5 lb (11.1 kg) and could display 52 x 24 characters on a small CRT. So yeah, that would not be nice to read manuals with :D<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Osborne_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Osborne_1</a>\n\n      Right it clearly was the best choice for the time the shuttle was developed but just shows how removed from the 1960s and 70s we are today.<p>My earlier point about payload weight was probably the wrong focus. Mission success and maximizing what the crew can accomplish in orbit are greatly facilitated by one way text from ground control, and doubtlessly paid for the 60 pounds<p>Astronauts were already used to Telex weather reports as pilots so existing UX. And the crew specialists all had PhDs and thus were experts at reading typed paper. So no training on yet another shuttle subsystem.<p>The teletype could be effectively shared between crew - just tear off the paper. A portable computer could only be used by one or two people, AND would need to be radiation hardened and aerospace qualified.\n\n      iPads are more hazardous than you think:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;23&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;fatal-helicopter-crash-likely-caused-by-dropped-ipad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;23&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;fatal-helicopter-...</a>\n\n        Not really an iPad-specific issue. A clipboard or checklist could have done the same thing.\n\n    Maybe they remember the situation with Apollo 13 where they had no way to right down the procedures other than by hand and using space pages from the existing printed documents. You then had the issue where the guys were so fatigued and CO2 levels getting to a point of making vision blurry. I could see where that might have factored into the decision of wanting to avoid all of that with the ability of printing new&#x2F;modified procedures.\n\n      too late to edit, but right != write &lt;hangsHeadInShame&gt;\n\n    Remember that this was also before easily portable electronics.<p>Today you&#x27;d get a PDF and store it on your iPad.  Secure it for landing and you&#x27;re good.  All the documents you want.<p>In the 80s consider the &quot;Mission Control has new landing procedures that you need to follow.  Here is a 42 item check list that you&#x27;ll need to do before initiating task 357 from the mission specification.&quot;<p>How do you get that 42 item check list?  Do you write it down?  What that transcribed properly?  Was that a P or a B that the person heard over the radio?  (Yes, I know Bravo Papa).<p>Here&#x27;s a secret objective for the mission ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;api&#x2F;citations&#x2F;20110023479&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;20110023479.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;api&#x2F;citations&#x2F;20110023479&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;20...</a> ) to preform while in orbit that has now been approved and was not part of the initial mission profile.  The instructions will be printed out and are for the captain and pilots eyes only.<p>There are a number of reasons that one may need a secure printer to handle new documents while on the Space Shuttle.  With 70s and 80s tech, the approach taken is reasonable.\n\n  &gt; I am fascinated they used 60 pounds and a large amount of space for this teleprinter.<p>IIRC the Zion space habitat in Neuromancer had a state-of-the-art line printer which at one point spews continuous-fold paper into the weightless environment.<p>They had however got rid of the slide-rules that were essential in early-era Arthur C Clarke spaceships\n\n    That was <i>Haniwa,</i> not Zion. The printer was spewing paper because someone had put a laser through its faceplate while Corto was taking the ship.<p>Also, <i>Haniwa</i> is described explicitly and implicitly as an exoatmospheric luxury yacht, and thus likely wasn&#x27;t designed for high acceleration. Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a thermal printer, not a line printer as here. Also, <i>Neuromancer</i> is period-piece literary sf. So I&#x27;m not necessarily sure how relevant it is here.\n\n      In terms of relevance, I was amused that real and contemporary fictional spacecraft both had paper printers\n\n        The question is, would the craft now need help from reaction wheels to offset the inertia from the moving print head &#x2F; paper feed?  Or would there need to be a special version of the printer firmware that kept track of its movement so it could always impart equal but opposite inertia?\n\n          Since a thermal printer only needs as much pressure on the platen roller as required to keep the paper registered, the roller itself could be hollow and thus carry negligible inertia. The print head could be net neutral by operating boustrophedonically, which many printers already do - both of my inkjets, for example! - and that might actually count for more, considering the possible need for some thermal mass to dissipate waste heat from the printing elements. (I don&#x27;t think modern thermal printers need that, but I suppose in the 80s they might have.) Worst case, the firmware might need to ensure the number of head passes is even, I think most simply by counting print passes and if needed performing a final &quot;return&quot; pass with a cold head - again a common behavior, and one also displayed by both my inkjets since that avoids the need for a parking station on either side of the paper path.<p>The line printer with its heavy drum would probably be more of a concern for the Shuttle, although I doubt a significant one. Reaction wheels function by <i>change</i> in angular momentum, and a line printer drum spins at a fixed rate in operation; as long as spinup and spindown take about the same time, which is easy enough to achieve, the net effect on attitude should be negligible, especially considering the entire printer constitutes only about 1&#x2F;3000 of the orbiter&#x27;s dry mass.<p>You might not want to run the thing during an OMS burn, but even if you did I doubt it&#x27;d matter; assuming constant thrust from spinup through spindown, your course would be displaced proportionally to the length of the print job, but given the minimal relative inertia and that line printers typically output in the tens of hundreds of lines per second I think it&#x27;d need quite a long job to make a noticeable difference, and you&#x27;d almost certainly run out of paper long before.<p>(Don&#x27;t take any of this too seriously; I&#x27;m the wrong kind of engineer to give authoritative answers here, but the question is fun to think about anyway.)\n\n            &quot;boustrophedonically&quot;: now there&#x27;s a word you don&#x27;t get to use very often (possibly unless you&#x27;re Indiana Jones).  That&#x27;s got to be worth something in Scrabble!\n\n            Tens to hundreds of lines per <i>minute</i>, not second. Good grief, line printers are scary enough as is, without also feeding paper fast enough to start friction fires...\n\n  The thing that immediately jumped into my head is coded military use. Especially since they mention the printer being based on a military design.<p>It&#x27;s still rather obscure, if not still secret, just to what extent we were actually using the shuttles in their intended military capacity.<p>But when designed, the military use was expected to be much much higher than what panned out.<p>This printer would be high on the list of the weight budget, to the point that I wonder if it wasn&#x27;t critical protocol to some still secret military use, similar to the teletype nuke codes &#x2F; orders on a sub.<p>Running over the audio system also makes me curious if it was strictly unencrypted comms, or if it could plug in to a decrypted steam. Were they clear broadcasting coded messages, or encrypted-broadcast clear messages (or both or neither).<p>IIRC, NASA used to have at least some &#x27;private&#x27; comms with astronauts that were in the clear, but they basically just didn&#x27;t rebroadcast to the public or publicize those currently used frequencies, and just sort of trusted those in the know not to listen in.\n\n    As far as cryptography, the military AN-UGC&#x2F;74 teleprinter worked with cryptographic equipment such as TSEC&#x2F;KG-30, KG-84, KW-7, and KY-57 [1]. You&#x27;d send the data stream into the crypto equipment and then to the teleprinter. However, the modifications for the Space Shuttle would have prevented this. Specifically, the FSK demodulation boards for the Shuttle were wired directly to the communication UART board, so there was no place to plug in the crypto box.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radionerds.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;e&#x2F;e0&#x2F;TM_11-5815-602-24.pdf#page=19\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radionerds.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;e&#x2F;e0&#x2F;TM_11-5815-602-24.pdf#pag...</a>\n\n    &gt;  The thing that immediately jumped into my head is coded military use. Especially since they mention the printer being based on a military design.<p>a significant portion of the funding for the shuttle came from the USAF, and one of its capabilities (to capture and return a large satellite) was a USAF requirement. They even went as far as building an entire launch pad for it at Vandenberg, which came very close to being used.\n\n    STS definitely encrypted all comms- voice, data, telemetry, and printer for the classified portions of all missions (that would be STS-51C, STS-51J, STS-27, STS-28, STS-33, STS-36, and STS-38 along with parts of STS-39 and STS-53).<p>My assumption is that the decryption happened upstream of the teleprinter- the teleprinter was definitely chosen because they thought it would be useful to print things for all missions, not because it provided special encryption for military purposes. When they did classified stuff everything was encrypted.<p>Basically, printers are really useful. They are heavy and they can break, but are tremendously useful.\n\n  Here&#x27;s my guess.  Government bureaucracy is probably very high for anything space related.  So <i>&quot;based on the military&#x27;s AN&#x2F;UGC-74&quot;</i> could have helped get it through approvals. It would have ticked a lot of boxes for ruggedized parts, use in harsh environments, and so on.\n\n    I don&#x27;t doubt that for a second- but I&#x27;m more curious about the requirement for some kind of printout in the first place.<p>Especially since it ultimately ended up weighing what it did.<p>Military&#x2F; Ruggedized is a smart choice for a printer that needs to go through that environment, no matter the why.<p>I&#x27;m more interested in what it tells us about the underlying purpose (or what it might rule out, like the part about wired directly into unencrypted comms).\n\n      Oh, I didn&#x27;t consider that, since I was a young person then.  Sticking notes, directives, etc, everywhere was just really common.  So if they get a note about extra daily checks on equipment X, they print&#x2F;affix the note to the equipment.  Or other similar needs.  There would probably be limited screens, so anything you wanted to be known to everyone, becomes a note.\n\n      I don&#x27;t think the requirement for printed output requires any appeal to military applications. They would have been exchanging navigation information with mission control over the radio. That&#x27;s all mission critical and needs to be read back. Anything they got via voice they would have to write down. Getting it by text in the first place would increase reliability and reduce cockpit workload.<p>You also get in-flight information like weather that you&#x27;ll want to write down for later reference. Teleprinter writes it for you so you can review it at your leisure.<p>Airliners and ships at sea have both historically used teleprinters for the same reasons, although the modern navigation computers have mostly eliminated the need.\n\n  &gt; At 30K per pound of payload that is $1.8 million per flight.<p>Yeah, but they could save by using white-label ink cartridges.\n\nX (twitter) is useless for threads unless you&#x27;re logged in. How can I read this thread?\n\n  Yeah somebody should mirror it. In general I dont understand why people post things like this on X. Its a horrible platform.\n\n    For some; for technically dumb people like me, it&#x27;s the only platform that&#x27;s easy to use.\n\n    What are some better alternatives?\n\n      Current best answer seem to be Mastodon and Bluesky.<p>If we are going by the number of users, Facebook has more users than Twitter and Threads has about the same order of magnitude, but we still see a lot more Twitter submissions to HN compared to Facebook and Threads[1].<p>If users prefer the microblog format, Mastodon and Bluesky appear to be the most compelling alternatives, both have been steadily gaining users[2].<p>[1] Submissions from various sites:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=twitter.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=twitter.com</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=threads.net\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=threads.net</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=facebook.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=facebook.com</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=bsky.app\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=bsky.app</a><p>Not sure how we can find the number of Mastodon links since it has so many domains.<p>[2] Mastodon and Bluesky user counts:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@mastodonusercount&#x2F;112131206329058510\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@mastodonusercount&#x2F;11213120632905851...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;post&#x2F;3klzrudt4uk2z\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;post&#x2F;3klzrudt4uk2z</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;post&#x2F;3kkv3clm3su2h\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;post&#x2F;3kkv3clm3su2h</a>\n\n    Serious answer: I post things on Twitter because it is easy, lets a huge number of people read my thread, and provides easy interaction. I post the same threads to Mastodon and get orders of magnitude less interest. I also write blog posts, which take a huge amount of time (a week versus an hour) and are hit-or-miss. Sometimes they are very popular and sometimes they disappear without a trace.\n\n      Might it be that it takes a week because you spend time thinking things through in a much more coherent manner rather than just submitting stream of conscious level tweets? Sounding professional instead of trendy?\n\n      I’m always delighted when I visit HN and see one of your blog posts on the front page; they posts are great and they elicit some of the most interesting HN discussions. It took me a little while to realize that all these good posts were on the same blog, but once I did I had a lovely time browsing through the archive and reading more of the “deep cuts.”<p>The posts about the System&#x2F;360 consoles come to mind, for example. I’m not sure how “popular” those were(?), but they’ve been very helpful as references for an art project I’m working on!\n\n      Why not Threads?\n\n  This was also posted on mastodon <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldbytes.space&#x2F;@kenshirriff&#x2F;112124283096167861\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldbytes.space&#x2F;@kenshirriff&#x2F;112124283096167861</a><p>(I assume it&#x27;s the same post, couldn&#x27;t read the one on twitter)\n\n    Can confirm it&#x27;s the same\n\n  Three ways you can read the thread: a) Log into Twitter. b) Read the same thread on Mastodon [1]. c) Wait until I turn it into a blog post.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldbytes.space&#x2F;@kenshirriff&#x2F;112124283096167861\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldbytes.space&#x2F;@kenshirriff&#x2F;112124283096167861</a>\n\n    Can I ask as a genuine question: why use twitter at all for a post like this? I’m not trying to be a Luddite or even just anti-twitter. I just don’t understand using it for long form deep topics like this. And yes I fully understand many people do use it this way, and to them I’d ask the same question.\n\n      Off the top of my head: Clicks&#x2F; Hype&#x2F;Sharing&#x2F;Reach.\n\n      I answered that question elsewhere in this thread: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39768125\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39768125</a>\n\n  From the guidelines[0]:<p><i>Please don&#x27;t complain about tangential annoyances—e.g. article or website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage.

If I were to find one and flip it upside-down, would it continue functioning normally?\n\n  Inkjets need a gas cartridge.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacepen.com&#x2F;our-story\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacepen.com&#x2F;our-story</a>\n\n  Not exactly a primary source but according to this thread: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=10617.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=10617.0</a><p>&quot;Toner is held to the paper in a laser printer by electrostatic attraction (opposite charges attract), not gravity. Along those same lines, in an inkjet printer ink droplets are fired at the paper, not just dropped, so once again I doubt gravity is an issue.&quot;\n\n    But before you even got to the point of printing, the paper in a regular laser or inkjet printer wouldn&#x27;t even feed properly if upside down!<p>I&#x27;m also willing to bet that whether or not the droplets are &quot;fired&quot; at the paper or not, the inkjet cartridges aren&#x27;t going to work in an inverted position: they might not even supply ink in that configuration.\n\n  Normal printers probably wouldn&#x27;t handle the shaking of launches and the extra G forces during that which for shuttle were ~3Gs.\n\n    And when shuttle was developed,  printers barely existed. Both inkjet and laser desktop printers were introduced commercially 1-3 years before the shuttles first flight in 1981, and weren’t very reliable yet. Desktop printers <i>still</i> aren’t as reliable as a teletype or dot matrix printer. There’s a reason airlines use dot matrix for printing flight manifests at the gate.<p>Ink plotters, teleprinters, and fax machines ruled the world. But plotters are dreadfully slow at writing text. Radio fax machines may have been viable if they were rugged enough. But they probably weighed as much as the teletype and were much slower - only real advantage is printing diagrams and photos.\n\n  Imagine a printer in zero gravity just spraying printed pages around the cabin of the shuttle, since pages don&#x27;t neatly fall into the output tray.\n\n  An Apple ImageWriter II would work, no matter what. I bet it&#x27;d work if they were printing DURING a launch.\n\n    The only competition it would have would be a Microline ML184.\n\nThis is cool but it just makes me think the Shuttle was absurdly inefficient across the board. Why waste not just the launch weight but the engineering work on making such a specialized printer? Aren’t we talking about the late 70s&#x2F; early 80s? Surely there were commercially available printers that could have been substituted that would weigh less and wouldn’t have the overheating issues. Having unlimited government money is ultimately a curse for efficiency and performance.\n\n  It&#x27;s overkill for normal office use but the space shuttle is going to have some massive vibration and mechanical shock during launch. All systems have to be ruggedized to withstand the environment. A commercial unit might not survive the trip up and building some sort of vibration damping system for it might take up more space. If the manufacturer can&#x27;t guarantee the uptime for the commercial unit, they might need a spare aboard as well also in its own special dampener case. Sometimes it just makes sense to do a custom design that meets your needs instead of trying to make a square peg fit a round hole. Also the related systems have to be considered. The Shuttle had a power bus of 28VDC, were there any commercial printers that took 28VDC and had proper EMI filtering? Were commercial printers compatible with the types of data signals expected on the Shuttle? You may need to build some sort of adapter to make a commercial printer work with the data and power systems. You may end up with something just as heavy and bulky and still not as reliable.\n\n    &gt; It&#x27;s overkill for normal office use but the space shuttle is going to have some massive vibration and mechanical shock during launch.<p>Maybe you haven&#x27;t seen how some delivery drivers treat the packages in their care. I swear I&#x27;ve received boxes that look like the were shaken, not stirred, to the level of a rocket launch.\n\n      Printers aren’t usually shipped in operable condition.\n\n        You&#x27;re suggesting that a printer being launched into space on a rocket would also not be secured in a similar fashion? What&#x27;s your point otherwise?\n\n  I have doubts a commercial printer back then would handle the 3G acceleration and vibrations during launch and reentry well. There&#x27;s also the issue of materials from the safety of them for fire risks to potential off gassing you wouldn&#x27;t notice in an office but could cause issues in the enclosed recycled atmosphere of the shuttle.<p>A lot of the cost for space bound items are from R&amp;D being concentrated in a few items but others are because it costs a lot to make sure they&#x27;re not going fail or kill someone. Using this behemoth saves some of the time by reusing a military line printer that was likely already tested for shock resistance if it was used on ships and for fire safety for similar reasons.<p>There&#x27;s also the potential military uses of the Shuttle which informed a lot of it&#x27;s design. Military printer already has the decoding infrastructure if it needs to be built in with known key management etc you&#x27;d have to build seprately for a commercial printer.\n\n  Its unlikely that it was special-built for the Space Shuttle. Obviously this is speculation, but it most likely was already special-designed for a military application and just re-used in the shuttle. All of those strategic nuclear bombers that used to fly on standby 24&#x2F;7 needed communications, too.\n\n    You don&#x27;t need to speculate. As I explained in the thread, the Shuttle teleprinter was based on the military AN&#x2F;UGC-74 teleprinter but had many modifications including new three circuit boards for the FSK decoding.\n\n      Ah yes, its right there in the 2nd post! Thanks for the correction.\n\n  The explanation for why they chose this printer is in a conference paper published in the National Telesystem Conference, 1982. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find these conference proceedings anywhere (even in physical form). If anyone happens to have a copy lying around...<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ui.adsabs.harvard.edu&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1982ntc..confR...4S&#x2F;abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ui.adsabs.harvard.edu&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1982ntc..confR...4S&#x2F;abstra...</a>\n\n    I couldn&#x27;t resist searching myself. It looks like there is a physical copy of the conference proceedings in a library in Japan!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topics.libra.titech.ac.jp&#x2F;recordID&#x2F;catalog.bib&#x2F;BA90249906?hit=7&amp;caller=xc-search\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topics.libra.titech.ac.jp&#x2F;recordID&#x2F;catalog.bib&#x2F;BA902...</a>\n\n      Let&#x27;s hope the internet can connect us with someone who lives near by and has a ibrary card!\n\n  If you trust that office printer to survive a roll down a steep mountain sure.<p>Your idea of how electromechanical devices &quot;just work&quot; is based on office environments (and even there they fail with astounding regularity today, half a century later).<p>As an electrical engineer that has repaired many (also very old) devices I don&#x27;t think you have a realistic idea of why the thing looks as it does. One point is environmental factors (strong vibration, harsh radiation, potential temperature differences etc) another one is risk managment. If your commercial printer fails, how will it fail? You better know <i>exactly</i> what it&#x27;s failure modes are, because you are the guy who selected that printer and <i>you</i> are reaponsible for both the failure of the mission and the potential death of astronauts who trust you. Still feel secure about the choice? Then you are probably the wrong person for the job.q<p>TL;DR: look for a certain (recent) submarine failure to see how well your approach works in practise\n\nThere&#x27;s a much simpler version of a communications &#x27;printer&#x27; called Hellschreiber<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hellschreiber\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hellschreiber</a><p>Some old specimens still work, some new reproductions have been made, and it can also be simulated in software with various popular ham-radio programs.<p>...also, it&#x27;s used by at least a few dozen hams every now and then :)\n\nTIL a space shuttle printer will fetch $8,659 at auction.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rrauction.com&#x2F;auctions&#x2F;lot-detail&#x2F;347156706649821-space-shuttle-teleprinter&#x2F;?cat=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rrauction.com&#x2F;auctions&#x2F;lot-detail&#x2F;34715670664982...</a>"

      "conversation_text": "I’ve seen this at a Fortune-50 company, on their own website!<p>Project managers got requisitions from HR and so they posted a job opening. (So far so good)<p>However, the company instituted hiring freezes for 2-3 quarters of each year. No hiring, even for the open positions…<p>Later, there would be layoffs, so PMs would trade unfilled requisitions with HR instead of firing existing people.<p>It mattered little in the end because they axed the entire department (up to the director) and rebuilt it overseas.<p>None of this was ever visible publicly.\n\n  I guess at least this is better than hanging on to people you don’t want in a team so they can be laid off when the demand comes in to avoid being forced to give up the people you do want.\n\n    Sounds like a dystopian shit hole.\n\n    Why not just fire them? Severance isn’t guaranteed yet in the US and just cause isn’t that hard to document (I’m genuinely asking - HR fascinates me).\n\n      He&#x27;s saying that whether or not they fire this person the day may come when they have to get rid of someone.<p>More broadly, managers like to hold onto headcount if they can unless someone is a real problem for their team. If they&#x27;re just someone who isn&#x27;t an ideal fit any longer they&#x27;ll probably hold onto them.\n\n        Exactly. They’re cards in a game that may require you to discard suddenly - you don’t want to discard early.\n\n    As someone who has worked in an environment like this for a long time, those people still exist. Everyone on the team generally knows who’s at the bottom and would get let go. Ideally there are enough open positions to cover the layoffs, but that’s not always the case.\n\n  I have a friend who works for a major aircraft mfg (that may have suicided a whistleblower) who&#x27;s seen this kind of activity for the better part of a decade over and over.  Currently going through a relatively credit migrate everything to the cloud effort.\n\n    This is odd, because, if anything, the Boeing 737 Max has been migrating <i>off</i> the cloud.\n\n      They already finished the migration... Fastest cloud to bare metal migration in history.<p>I also hear they have a unique, high-impact approach to blackbox testing.\n\n        Move fast, break things!\n\n      you son of a ...\n\n      I don&#x27;t quite understand this - is the plane moving to on premise? What features of the cloud does it use regularly?\n\n        It was a joke, the constant parts falling from them… falling from the clouds. Literal clouds, not datacenter clouds.\n\n        They&#x27;re going on-premise all right! Straight back to the hangar... Then off to the scrap heap.<p>That&#x27;s certainly one way to go bare metal.<p>In terms of cloud features they used; the one where it breaks up mid air and rains down to earth...\n\n    Even in the before times (before they were run by MBAs), that company was notorious for boom&#x2F;bust hiring&#x2F;firing of both blue collar and white collar workers.\n\n      Yeah, it&#x27;s nothing new. &quot;Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights&quot; is from a 1971 bust.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.historylink.org&#x2F;File&#x2F;1287\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.historylink.org&#x2F;File&#x2F;1287</a>\n\n  This has been standard practice where I’m at for at least a decade. I don’t know if the jobs were even posted, but we always felt short staffed. It turned out the Sr Dir would always hold back at least 3 position and leave them unfilled, so when layoffs came (which happens at least twice a year), he could simply give up those reqs and it would appear to the team that we were unaffected and operations could keep running as normal.<p>It wasn’t until I made it into the VPs inner circle that I found out how the game was played.\n\n    I have also heard that managers like to keep job postings for every role up if employment conditions create a flight risk. If someone gives their 2 weeks notice, there is a nice long pipeline of would-have-been ghost candidates for their role, which speeds up recruiting the replacement by a month at least.\n\n    This seems really stupid if I&#x27;m understanding correctly. So layoffs come as a way to reduce costs, and instead you can give up an empty seat that probably at best had a few thousand dollars of labor trying (not) to hire for? This sounds like a hiring freeze with extra steps instead of a layoff.<p>And ofc the concept of skilled labor needed year round needing to layoff people twice a year is a failure in and of itself. Why not just contract the job at that point? government nitty griity details, I&#x27;m guessing?\n\n  &gt; It mattered little in the end because they axed the entire department (up to the director) and rebuilt it overseas.<p>burying the lede<p>it&#x27;s a shell game &#x2F; chaos situation while they ultimately implement cost cutting.\n\ni assumed it was an immigration scam to say company couldn&#x27;t fill the role locally as a prerequisite for getting someone in on immigration work visa?\n\n  Yes, this is what happens in Singapore. There is a requirement to post job vacancies on a government job portal for a certain time before a company can apply for a work visa.\nMany companies maintain ghost job vacancies just in case.\n\n    The government should treat these are trash and send out fines.\n\n      The government in the U.S. literally requires these &quot;non-jobs&quot; to be advertised.\n\n        i expect the spirit of the law is to actually try and hire a local, but the letter falls short and merely requires the advertising\n\n          I would say the law will catch up but it&#x27;s probably just part of cost of reveune.<p>But the USG will eventually sue you if you&#x27;re making job ads that you don&#x27;t want to actually be filled for the purpose of h1b &#x2F; green cards.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-department-secures-25-million-landmark-agreement-apple-resolve-employment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-department-secures-25...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-labor-departments-reach-settlements-facebook-resolving-claims-discrimination-against\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-labor-departments-rea...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.gov&#x2F;agencies&#x2F;whd&#x2F;fact-sheets&#x2F;62s-h1b-willful-violators\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.gov&#x2F;agencies&#x2F;whd&#x2F;fact-sheets&#x2F;62s-h1b-willful...</a>\n\n          No; it&#x27;s really just about proving that there&#x27;s no-one who&#x27;s qualified.\n\n            Nobody is qualified because the ad is written around a candidate they&#x27;ve already verbally hired.<p>It&#x27;s a stupid song and dance. If people really want to be isolationist, they should crack down on it. If we really want freedom, drop the requirement. Until then it&#x27;s just insulting to see a job posting that I know is for the brother of the guy who already works here, who is already promised the job.\n\n    NZ also. Used to work in social security, posting jobs with us used to be sufficient to say &quot;we tried to hire locally, but no dice&quot;.<p>So we&#x27;d get positions like &quot;Chef for Asian restaurant, must known how to cook food Sichuan style and must be fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, $10ph&quot;<p>(At the time, minimum wage was $9ph)<p>You weren&#x27;t getting a chef for $10 ph, you&#x27;re not even getting a cook.<p>And definitely no-one who is fluent in your desired languages.<p>Ditto the golf coach required, some golf certification required, fluent in Japanese and Mandarin, $10 p&#x2F;h.\n\n  Or they already have them and want the EB2 application lock-in.\n\n  Yep, many of these same ads on seek here in Sydney. I applied for one once and I had a few completely fake interviews that had someone just asking buzzword bingo questions. It was completely senseless until a few searches lead me to what was going on. It was surreal a the time. I didn&#x27;t know what was going on.<p>Now, years past, I am thinking it would be fun to do this again for a youtube video like kitboga or Jim Brown.\n\n&gt;The labour market is tightening – and it&#x27;s getting harder to find a job.<p>as a small rant, I am getting tired of the whiplash between &quot;it&#x27;s harder than ever to find a job&quot; and &quot;the economy has recovered and unemployement is record lows&quot;. This is normally easily explainable but these seem to both be bipartisan points from my browsing on the topic. So I am simply perplexed.\n-------<p>On topic: Ghost jobs are such a weird concept in this day and age. As we see here, it is extremely easy to get hundreds, thousands of resumes within days of a job posting, so why pretend to keep resumes on record to call people on later? The latest I&#x27;ve been contacted about such a role was some 5 months later, and that was due to a referral randomly pinging the company for a tangential job. Otherwise, anything that hasn&#x27;t responded within a month may as well be cast to the void.<p>The most common lip service seems to be what you expect:<p>&gt;Half the respondents reported they keep job listings open indefinitely because they &quot;always open to new people&quot;. More than one in three respondents said they kept the listings active to build a pool of applicants in case of turnover – not because a role needs to be filled in a timely manner.<p>Exactly my point. But maybe it&#x27;s just me. Has anyone ever had a &gt;1 month response from a company that has experienced turnover?<p>&gt; More than 40% of hiring managers said they list jobs they aren&#x27;t actively trying to fill to give the impression that the company is growing. A similar share said the job listings are made to motivate employees, while 34% said the jobs are posted to placate overworked staff who may be hoping for additional help to be brought on.<p>Well, these seem to be the more brutally honest answers. Fraud is probably too strong a word, but this does feel like exploitive behavior that should be reigned in.\n\n  Regarding the start of the topic, just note the world is not homogeneous. For example the US economy&#x2F;job market is in a better state than the uk one; there are seasonal fluctuations in demand for work that keep statistics always changing; some jobs may be more in demand than others (eg low-skill wages were going up in the US while big tech companies did layoffs). And the news story is so often on the complaining side (eg that there are no jobs or that there are no workers) where I think it can be easy to not notice that the direction changed.\n\n    It&#x27;s also simultaneously possible to have low unemployment numbers and have companies be pretty deliberate about new hires and have people tending to stay where they are.<p>And, anecdotally, I see mostly pretty senior people leaving--maybe retiring a bit early. Was just having a conversation about this with a friend of mine.\n\n      It can also really vary a lot based on job type.  Software development is a pretty small niche in terms of total US jobs, doesn&#x27;t mean that a lot of devs are currently looking.<p>Most of the jobs I&#x27;ve been applying to have hundreds of applicants.  It&#x27;s been rough to say the least.  Since January, I&#x27;ve had a couple times where I&#x27;m in the final few and an offer at a startup that didn&#x27;t get the funding they needed.<p>I&#x27;m getting relatively anxious and far more open to most things at this point.  A 1&#x2F;3 pay cut is rough, but I need a job.\n\n  &gt; More than 40% of hiring managers said they list jobs they aren&#x27;t actively trying to fill to give the impression that the company is growing.<p>Sounds like securities fraud\n\n    Only if it&#x27;s publicly traded company. 20ish people startup, anything goes.\n\n      &gt; 20ish people startup, anything goes.<p>its up to the person involved in a securities transaction to bring the lawsuit, or snitch<p>nice bounties for this by the way, doesn&#x27;t rely on the presence of shares, or being publicly traded. bonds, options, warrants, just as good<p>employees and contractors and outside personnel can snitch too, just make sure the amounts are worthwhile. if you use a lawyer the US government allows anonymity for this programme\n\n  &gt; I am getting tired of the whiplash between &quot;it&#x27;s harder than ever to find a job&quot; and &quot;the economy has recovered and unemployement is record lows&quot;. This is normally easily explainable<p>I’m curious. How can these be true at once?\n\n    One sector booms whilst another busts.\n\n      I think it&#x27;s orthogonal to sector. Wealthy and established workers are doing REALLY well, everyone else is struggling.\n\n    The bank J.P. Morgan recently published an analysis about employment in the US [1] (this is the best source I could initially find with no paywalls and a non-superficial, sector-by-sector look at the data). According to the report:<p>* &quot;The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the U.S. economy added 275,000 jobs in February.&quot; However, &quot;unemployment rose to 3.9% in February, the highest rate since January 2022.&quot; In January 2024, the overall employment rate was 3.7%.<p>* &quot;A spike in construction, retail and food services jobs contributed to the surprising gain in employment in February.&quot;<p>* &quot;Payroll gains in February were distributed across many areas of the economy. Health care, leisure and hospitality and government led the way, contributing to almost three quarters of the job gains.&quot;<p>This matches with the anecdotes that I&#x27;ve been hearing from day-to-day conversation: certain sectors such as health care and the service industry are short on people, whereas openings are far fewer in other sectors such as technology. However, I couldn&#x27;t find employment data specific to the tech sector in this brief report.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpmorgan.com&#x2F;insights&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;economic-outlook&#x2F;jobs-report-february-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpmorgan.com&#x2F;insights&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;economic-outlook&#x2F;j...</a>\n\n    Tried to hire a plumber or concrete placer lately? Prepare to be ghosted or given a &quot;fuck off&quot; quote. However, place a listing for &quot;web developer wanted&quot; and you&#x27;ll drown in applicants. It turns out that when fields close to technology and media tighten up, the techno-media bubble lose their minds about it. Not so much when the labourer market dries up.\n\n  &gt; as a small rant, I am getting tired of the whiplash between &quot;it&#x27;s harder than ever to find a job&quot; and &quot;the economy has recovered and unemployement is record lows&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re in tech (as most of us are here) it can be pretty tough to find a job right now unless you have mad AI skillz. But in other sectors it&#x27;s generally pretty easy to find a job right now. So both can be true depending on what sector you&#x27;re in.\n\n    I just watched an investor talk about any field that is effected by changing yields (interest rates) is getting crushed but others are doing fine.  Tech was probably the most sensitive field but I think construction and banks are also effected.  Construction is complicated because data centers are doing fine while multi-family and commercial are screwed.\n\n    I wish that was true, but I was also going around to staffing offices the past few months looking for any temp work to make ends meet and almost all of the dozen staffing agencies said that roles were sparce right now. So if nothing else it seems like it&#x27;s not tech exclusive. It&#x27;s weird because I am still at least getting recruiter calls, but I&#x27;m simply being cut very early in the process more often, so I don&#x27;t necessarily want anything too long term<p>This is in Los Angeles by the way. I hear California in particular has higher unemployment than average, so maybe it&#x27;s a local issue.\n\nI had applied for one job via linked in a few years back and it was entirely a scam to do data collection. They kept asking for more and more info about me. I stopped responding when they wanted to run a credit check and asked me to email them my social security number.\n\n  This is why you put typos and obvious flaws earlier in the communication, so you only spend time dealing with less discerning people<p>I think scammers rely on that too much, in other faster moving areas I think looking exactly like official communication will get higher quality marks, but for recruiting typos are the way\n\n    1. Why would scammers care? Presumably it&#x27;s a numbers game for them, and most job applicants are genuine, so why would they bother screening out people with bad grammar&#x2F;spelling?<p>2. If you&#x27;re a job applicant, wouldn&#x27;t having obvious typos&#x2F;grammar issues make you look less professional? Also, &quot;bad spelling&#x2F;grammar = scam&quot; is a heuristic that people use as well, so you&#x27;re effectively banking on the fact that the employer is desperate enough for a rockstar engineer that they&#x27;ll interview anyone who applies.\n\n      yeah you misread that completely, but my comment was based on understanding how scammers already operate<p>the <i>scammers</i> use mispellings in their own job postings and communications, to attract people that would ignore the mispellings, because those people would ignore many other things too\n\n  I kind of think that is the case with Jobot.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever communicated or talked to an actual person.\n\nUsually, if I see a role i&#x27;m interested in is more than 1 month old, I won&#x27;t apply. In the current market, I would probably reduce that to 2 weeks.\n\nWhat&#x27;s worse is the clueless Feds count each of these as real jobs.\n\nI&#x27;ve seen these before. Someone is under a lot of pressure to hire&#x2F;build a team. Hence the job posts. But they&#x27;re not given any hiring power or budget. Hence ghosting. Most companies would rather leave the job open unfilled than admit they can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t fill it. I mean, how do you go back to a candidate and say &quot;I&#x27;d love to hire you but I got overruled and now you&#x27;re 6 months in the hiring backlog, sorry about our internal politics.&quot; But take the job post down - never! The position isn&#x27;t filled yet!\n\n  We really appreciate your time and effort in applying for $Position.  We&#x27;ve decided not to move forward with your candidacy at this time.  Feel free to apply for other open positions at $site.\n\n    I will take a rejection! Way better than the application going into a black hole. My favorite is when the company remembers to clear out its inbox, and you receive a rejection for a role you applied to some 10+ months ago.\n\n      Considering I&#x27;ve been applying for hundreds of jobs in the past few months, I think I&#x27;d Rather hear nothing if I never actually spoke to a person.\n\n  That this is widespread is a blanket indictment of America&#x27;s executive and managerial classes. Maybe start laying <i>them</i> off.\n\n    How? Please tell us as we desperately need an answer. They just go and infect every company. It is still generally considered an achievement to get a business degree from an elite school in some circles so the pipeline is not going away either.\n\n      The &quot;easiest&quot; (ethical) way involves a societal change to what people (and therefore, stockholers) value. Other countries do not in fact like it when a CEO needs to layoff people, and ofc other countries have protections against frivolous firings. So doing that isn&#x27;t just a legal issue but a financial pain point.<p>If the US ever had it, it needs to bring back shaming unethical business decisions. Layoffs should tank a company&#x27;s share and poison the exec class in current and future endeavors, not give a tiny bump of shares and a golden parachute at best. But that&#x27;s an uphill battle from what I see.\n\n        Guerilla efforts to make their lives as much of a living nightmare as their decisions make others&#x27; might be what&#x27;s left. Non-violent, targeted harassment with clear qualification (at least X net worth, at least Y layoffs, in role at Z corp) as a form of civil disobedience. Hopefully just the threat would get the ball rolling on treating the less well-off with more dignity. If anyone thinks this is unethical, so is a $2,000 plate while people are dumpster diving out back.\n\nIt costs (little to) nothing to keep them up, so why not do it?\n\n  They need to bring back the newspaper model. Change per word and for each day it runs.\n\nData miners, staffing agency lead generation firms, and phishers...<p>Some are brazen enough to advertise their &quot;AI Powered HR tools&quot; as they waste applicants time. In some places it is a crime to collect personal information without a time constrained retention window, and honest disclosure of intended use-case.<p>The fact remains that unless a company has posted a recent position on their site it likely won&#x27;t exist for general applicants.<p>Best of luck, =)\n\n  The recruiters are the worst.  Or, as you put it, staffing agency lead generation firms.  I had not recognized it as such, but the truth is the truth.  And that description the fucking truth.<p>What follows below is a rant, and you can ignore it if you like.<p>Most of these sorts of contacts come from Linkedin, where I have an up-to-date profile showing the nearly 11 years of work in mechanical product and equipment design as a Mechanical Design Engineer, a few of those years being an Engineering Manager for a small automation group.<p>I keep getting hit up by recruiters for positions that, frankly, would be a career change.  &quot;Our client has an urgent need for a structural engineer.&quot;  Well, that&#x27;s great, of course, but I&#x27;m not one of those.  That&#x27;s really a branch of Civil or Architectural Engineering.  Not Mechanical.  &quot;That&#x27;s OK, you&#x27;re still a great fit.&quot;<p>We end up going through the process of finding out the compensation, where I question: Are you sure they&#x27;re going to be willing to pay someone who is new at this job the same salary as someone who&#x27;s been working in their field for over a decade?<p>I&#x27;m talking to these people because I rarely pass on learning about an opportunity.  There&#x27;s a chance for me to go for my Professional Engineer license in these gigs, so it&#x27;s worth exploring a little bit.<p>Invariably, we get to the point of receiving feedback from the hiring firm and the response is &quot;Well... you aren&#x27;t a structural &#x2F; Professional &#x2F; MEP &#x2F; BIM engineer, which is what we require.&quot;  Bonus points for that part of the feedback being received during an interview by the miserable fuck who didn&#x27;t know when to ignore a recruiter: me.<p>To round all this out be to be back on topic: Thank you @joel_mckay for that &quot;staffing agency lead generation firm&quot; line.  That helps me to realize what I&#x27;ve been coming to suspect is true:  These aren&#x27;t actually recruiters hired by firms.  They&#x27;re people scouring Linkedin for anyone who&#x27;s a) breathing and b) has some overlapping words, for a job post the &quot;recruiter&quot; probably also found on Linkedin.\n\n    There are specialty agencies for engineers like aerotek.com that will help with international placements. I&#x27;m unaffiliated with the firm, but they were legitimate at one time.<p>Note your PE ticket is regional, and will constrain where you can be employed in such roles.  Fine if you drop anchor in a city works-yard or utility, but not really a lot of vertical movement in such roles.<p>Journeyman&#x2F;Journey-person certification is usually quicker, and with a practical factory background will keep you busy.<p>Note in some regions the requirements for either cert path can vary a lot.<p>Best of luck =)\n\nThis is fraud. Make it a felony, have a couple of high-profile convictions, and the problem will disappear. It happens because it&#x27;s zero risk and low cost on one side, and the resources expended on the candidate side is of no concern to those committing the fraud. Attach real actual jail time to the fraud and the value proposition completely changes.\n\nA relative of mine works for a large tech company. Her manager has 2 open reqs on the team. However, he has been told that he can’t hire anyone in California or New York. This is not to say that there are no qualified candidates elsewhere, but there are a ton of qualified candidates in the Bay Area that he can’t hire. He will probably eventually fill the roles, but it will take a lot longer.\n\n  Why not CA or NY?\n\n    Non-American here: do those states happen to have better employee protections by any chance?\n\n      Yes.\n\n      Generally, yes.<p>CA and NY are also states that mandatory pay range disclosures for job adverts, too.\n\n    It could be due to pay. Some companies adjust pay based on where people live, adjusted for COL. CA and NY tend to be on the high end. Just one possible theory, there could be many other reasons.\n\n      That&#x27;s the most likely explanation. Companies don&#x27;t want to go through a whole hiring process just to have a candidate laugh at the offer. Whether or not companies have any sort of formal don&#x27;t hire in CA or NY policy, I see a lot of non-SV companies informally pulling back from CA--closing offices and the like.\n\n    These are the most expensive job markets and the company is trying to reduce labor costs.\n\n      Someone could be willing to work for a lower than average rate if it’s the right company though.\n\nMaybe they all have an interview process like that post here yesterday on Canonical or Google, where people do ten interviews, each one trying harder and hard to avoid employing a perfectly qualified application so they can inflate their self worth?\n\nI worked at a large company. My manager told me there&#x27;s a legal requirement to post jobs publicly even though the position was intended for internal hiring. I don&#x27;t know how true this is. If it is true, this could explain some of the &#x27;ghost jobs&#x27;.\n\n  I’ve heard of this before as well. I’ve actually looked at applying for some internal jobs and was told not to bother, because it was the posting for a certain person.<p>Had it happen for me once as well. A new team was being formed that I was part of. I was given a certain job post ID to apply for that was meant for me. Some people got upset, because they were told to apply for a level 2 position, when they saw a level 3 or 4 position was also out there that they wanted to go for… but the decisions had already been made.\n\n    Years after the fact, I was curious if a job opening created for me when a higher-up wanted to bring me in was posted for a bit. If so, other people probably didn&#x27;t have much of a chance. Although I had some interviews, I don&#x27;t think I ever even applied to the job through the online system.\n\n      That makes me wonder if another one of my promotions was posted. My interview was the manager walking up to me while I was standing off to the side in the lunchroom waiting for someone else, and he simply said, “if anyone asks, I interviewed you.” He then walked away and I had a promotion.\n\nCompany&#x27;s website is rife with ghost jobs.<p>I worked in one where there was a layoff and hiring freeze. Yet the website contains hundreds of open positions.\n\nWithout knowing anything about economics or how they work, what crosses my mind and that is just a hypothesis, yet a plausible scenario, is that companies do this to maintain their financial validity due to current market turbulence of uncertainty...because if you think about it, if they don&#x27;t show they are hiring, they will give the impression of stagnation, thus the loss of their current market value; but if they show they are hiring, without the outsiders knowing they are actually do not, it gives the false impression of company&#x27;s growth, thus reassuring investors&#x27; financial concerns.<p>I hope I&#x27;m very wrong, but I have my doubts...\n\nI see a good number of what are obviously copied reqs and some that are just so ridiculous that they can&#x27;t be real (lottery winning salary etc, remote work, C-level title, etc). 2 basic explanations here, maybe 3.<p>If you wanted to start a recruiting operation you&#x27;d start with no job reqs and no customer firms most likely. You&#x27;re going to need some of those. One way to get them would be to source a pool of resumes, talk to some candidates, sell them on your fake portfolio of reqs etc. NOW you got a pool of quality resumes and some candidates you can pump and you start making calls and sending emails to companies requesting they sign your payment agreement for access to all the awesome candidates in your pool.<p>Alternatively, if you work a W2 job in HR&#x2F;corporate recruiting, you have metrics and a schedule of work like anyone else. The metaphorical left arm of corporate and the equivalent right arm are not aware of each others existence and operation in this setting. You get job reqs in a system and you post them. Are they approved for hire? Are they Hopes and Dreams from department managers? Are they vetted internally to be real at all? Who knows. All the person positing knows is that they&#x27;re getting paid to be at work, be a recruiter, and source people. They post these reqs and keep cashing paychecks. This is normal.<p>Still yet, there are advertised govt. positions for state agencies. Recruiters often just take these reqs unaltered from the state entity and post them as if they&#x27;re repping them. They&#x27;re not most likely but they may have some broader agreement with a state organization for payment so they post them anyhow. This is free inventory for recruiters and any add they place, anyone they talk to, any resume they get .. thats a fish in the boat for free. Of course this happens.<p>In my own pursuits I have a set of rules I rate reqs by. Being able to get someone on the phone is important. If you&#x27;re real, you can hop on a call and you in fact want to. When I do talk to someone they shouldn&#x27;t be asking me for SSN or other IDs either, because they want to &quot;submit&quot; you right away, thus binding the company they submit your info to for payment in the event of your hire. This is a game in itself because you are forever burned to come into this company again either on your own or via a higher quality recruiter. DO NOT EVER FALL FOR THIS. Another one is you&#x27;d better speak English as well as I do (I&#x27;m in the US) and if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re an offshore resume mill and I want none of what you&#x27;re doing.

      "conversation_text": "ESG was basically instantly exploited to the point of uselessness. It&#x27;s kinda funny how for a little while slapping ESG on your investment product would get you a free bump, and equally funny how conservative governments completely failed to see it as nothing more than a marketing technique and ascribed far more importance to the label than anyone else ever did.\n\n  Conservative governments haven&#x27;t failed to see anything. This is about optics and votes, and this will garner more for them. It&#x27;s a double whammy: they can hammer the progressive ideals ESGs align with, while at the same time looking like they support local jobs&#x2F;industry. A no-brainer, really.\n\n    I guess we&#x27;ve gotta hope China solves the problems that we can&#x27;t\n\n      China is exempt from ESG.\n\n0.00085% of their Assets under management. If compared to their assets under management growth from 2022 to 2023 it&#x27;s just over two days of growth\n\n  A rounding error. It’s honestly terrifying how much wealth is concentrated in this one company.\n\n    This should be the top comment. Don’t forget Vangaurd and State Street too.\n\n    Virtually none of that money is in blackrock though. The money is in the companies invested in. Blackrock however does have enormous discretion in which companies get that money. But it&#x27;s also not exactly opaque, these funds are pretty transparent and overall very bland.\n\n    It has the more money than most countries.\n\n  Here&#x27;s to hoping it will be two weeks of growth next, then two months, then two years.<p>The sooner ESG mandates stop infecting companies, the better.<p>Edit: Yesterday you could have said they didn&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s only $4B, one day of growth. Today you can say $12.5B, or three days of growth. Yes, it&#x27;s a trickle, but it might continue to grow.\n\n    Would you think its better to have a mandate to just set all possibly flammable resources on fire?<p>Mandating transitioning away from petroleum is a no brainer.<p>Installation of renewables is vastly cheaper, faster to market, and has the fringe benefit of not bringing about the end of our ecosystem...\n\n      We&#x27;re not going to fully transition for awhile. Solar, wind, and storage are all terrific, but we&#x27;ll need to keep natural gas and some amount of coal around for quite a while. It will run less and less, but will be critical when it gets really hot or cold and the wind&#x2F;sun. Mandating a transition away isn&#x27;t really necessary as those resources are all starting to retire anyway. It&#x27;s a pretty complicated industry between the electricity markets and state&#x2F;regional regulators.<p>Just because wind and solar are cheaper (also heavily subsidized via the IRA) doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s all we need. They&#x27;re intermittent and not dispatchable in the same way the older traditional resources were. One solution is to build a massive amount of batteries or a large DC macro grid, but even then, it won&#x27;t solve all the problems and the massive projected growth in demand. Making demand more price responsive won&#x27;t solve the problem either in all cases.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of folks like NERC (in charge of reliability of the bulk electric system for the US and Canada) and MISO (a large regional organization that handles reliability on a regional level) sounding the alarm on this.\n\n      No cataclysm visited upon the entire world would be enough to fulfill your sweeping demands.<p>Are you sure your wishes are tantamount to a force of nature?\n\n  8.5B &#x2F; 10T = 0.0085 = 0.85%<p>Edit: DOH! chowchowchow is right, I made pretty much the same mistake. Correction below:<p>8.5B &#x2F; 10T = 8.5 &#x2F; 10000 = 0.00085 = 0.085%\n\n    .085%. 1% of 10T is 100B. Big numbers are big.\n\nI&#x27;d have thought the Ideologically Pure folks over in Texas would invest&#x2F;divest solely and exclusively on the basis of whether it&#x27;s a good place to get returns? Even accepting their excuse that ESG investing is suffocating their oil and gas-dependent &quot;long term financial health,&quot; that&#x27;s ultimately just saying they think the government needs to more strongly place its thumb on the scales.\n\n  &gt; that&#x27;s ultimately just saying they think the government needs to more strongly place its thumb on the scales.<p>They have $8.5B.  They&#x27;ve got a big enough thumb themselves.\n\n  There is an &quot;ideologically pure&quot; faction of the GOP that continues to oppose such measures. That faction recently backed Nikki Haley in the primaries, and the results show that this faction no longer carries the majority. There&#x27;s been a reckoning on the right since the Bush debacle and a growing recognition that free market libertarianism and conservatism are actually two different ideologies.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think there is long term evidence that ESG adds alpha. Even if it did in the past, there&#x27;s no reason to believe it will continue once it is being gamed as it is now and the term becomes amorphous. Texas ever investing in ESG in the first place was the ideologically impure thing to do, if their only goal is performance.\n\n    That’s fine, but that’s not why they said they’re pulling their money.\n\n  Whether or not the disgruntled group controls a government - this can decide whether [unliked cause] is<p><i>worthy only of ridicule</i> or<p><i>an imminent threat needing action</i>\n\nWhat’s funny about this is that, concerns about fraud in ESG metrics aside, this will cause Texas schools to lose out on the gains from rapidly growing clean energy companies, many of which are taking advantage of the deregulated Texas power grid to get a foothold.\n\n  As Ron White once said at the Majestic Theatre in Dallas, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fix Stupid.&quot; (decisions, in this context)<p>It&#x27;s one thing to burn investment dollars that are your own, but to do so with educational system dollars?

It&#x27;s a religion, put simply. But to waste resources like this out of ideology? It&#x27;s just sad.<p>Texas has a teacher shortage [1] and ranks as one of the most uneducated states [2]. This does no favors to those who need the educational system. And those making these decisions will be long dead while those impacted will continue to live the remainder of their lives sub-optimally from these decisions.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;texas-teacher-shortage-cultural-exchange-aldine-isd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;texas-teacher-shorta...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kxan.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;education&#x2F;texas-is-one-of-the-most-uneducated-states-in-the-u-s-study-says&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kxan.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;education&#x2F;texas-is-one-of-the-most...</a>\n\n        And [2] sure does play into the whole policy...\n\n  &gt; this will cause Texas schools to lose out on the gains from rapidly growing clean energy companies<p>The existence of rapidly growing clean energy companies is only meaningful if BlackRock can reliably pick those winners in advance.

Blackrock will do whatever their clients tell them and the largest share holders of fossil companies like Chevron, Exxon and Shell.

And (unrelated to DB perf) don&#x27;t use the spread operator in JS for passing function args (the author says not to use the spread operator at all but you don&#x27;t need to go that far)\n\n  Thank you. Also, what database was in use?\n\n    sqlite3, but I think bulk inserts would improve perf for other DBs too.\n\n      PG has “copy” which would blow away bulk inserts. Other DB vendors have similar stuff for high-performance inserts. You would be much better off using those than using bulk inserts.\n\n    sqlite\n\nJDBC has &quot;batch updates&quot; feature. You can use single inserts but they&#x27;re sent as a batch of multiple statements to the database. Not sure about JS libraries, but this feature also significantly improves performance and probably easier to use and maintain.<p>For super fast inserts you can use postgres COPY feature. But it has to be implemented in the driver.\n\nI wonder how `.import` would compare vs creating a huge batch insert string in memory.\n\n  I remember SQLite have been using inserts to implement import under the hood.\n\nI wonder if they tried prepared statements - parsing 100k identical insert statements surely is avoidable.\n\n  I didn’t even think of that, I‘m gonna have to try them out and compare against the two other implementations.\n\nyou might like my post - Towards Inserting One Billion Rows in SQLite Under A Minute [0]<p>[0] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avi.im&#x2F;blag&#x2F;2021&#x2F;fast-sqlite-inserts&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avi.im&#x2F;blag&#x2F;2021&#x2F;fast-sqlite-inserts&#x2F;</a>"

As the article notes:<p>&gt; Ireland’s budget watchdog, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said last year that just three foreign companies contributed around a third of Ireland’s corporate tax revenue from 2017 to 2021. Company filings showed Apple, Google and Microsoft paid the most taxes in 2021.<p>&gt; The Central Bank is also warning of the country’s over-dependence on income tax revenue from a small number of the world’s richest countries.<p>...which leaves Ireland hostage to a tiny number of foreign corporations, that obviously don&#x27;t give a crap about the country.  And to the foreign tax laws which - <i>for now</i> - allow trillion-dollar corporations to launder their profits through tax-haven Ireland.\n\n  PLA not opening base on  Ireland anytime soon\n\n    The CCP actually has institutions[1] present in many western nations.

I use GitLab for work, and the experience is definitely more clunky than GitHub.

In my opinion, by any measure other than &quot;marketing speak that might pique your interest,&quot; I see the headers as an absolute failure to capture reality. Github is the world&#x27;s leading platform for software collaboration, sure. But it isn&#x27;t &quot;powered by AI.&quot; Copilot, a beta programming assistant tangential to their main product, is AI powered. But (rounding up) 100% of Github&#x27;s core features have nothing to do with AI.<p>What is the marketer&#x27;s perspective on lofty homepage statements that aren&#x27;t grounded in reality? What are your thoughts on the usage of terms that are losing all meaning? &quot;AI&quot; seems to be one. If everyone has it, it differentiates no one. To some group of people, it might even be seen as a negative.\n\n  A marketer&#x27;s perspective would be that the job of the ten words above the fold is to entice you to learn more, to pique your interest. Not at all to communicate everything about the product -- docs are for that. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that these statements aren&#x27;t &quot;grounded in reality,&quot; but I do understand your sentiment."

      "conversation_text": "This article has a significant backstory.<p>A highly influential study by Chadwick et al. in 1991 [1] asserted that reports of fatal short falls in children are invariably falsified and actually stem from violence. They reached this conclusion by noting a significantly higher (7 times more in their data) hospital patient fatality rate after short falls (&lt; 1.20 m) compared to long falls (&gt; 3 m). They interpreted this apparent mathematical paradox (&quot;short falls are not 7x more severe that long falls!&quot;) as evidence that all reports of short falls were falsified, and that these deaths were violent murders.<p>However, they overlooked many factors, including the fact that most nonfatal short falls do not result in hospital consultations; only the most severe ones do. Conversely, nearly all long falls (such as from several stories) are likely to prompt a hospital visit, even if the child appears uninjured. The hospital fatality rate is heavily influenced by this denominator, which does not accurately reflect the total number of short falls in a population—only the small subset that leads to hospital consultation.<p>This article, along with others, has led many physicians worldwide to doubt reports of short falls whenever a child sustains severe or fatal intracranial injuries, often resulting in criminal prosecution and conviction. There have been numerous cases of miscarriages of justice [2], and the issue persists.<p>In collaboration with mathematician Leila Schneps [3], our paper employs a particularly simple statistical model to quantify the impact of the hospital consultation rate confounding variable on the apparent hospital patient fatality rate. This is a small step towards helping physicians understand that reports of fatal short falls are not always falsified (though they may be, of course, but not always). There are many other scientific arguments, of course (case reports, including videotaped ones, biomechanical data, animal models, etc. [4])<p>This issue is similar to the famous case of Sally Clark, wrongly convicted because of statistical misunderstandings [5].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.lww.com&#x2F;jtrauma&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;1991&#x2F;10000&#x2F;Deaths_from_Falls_in_Children__How_Far_is_Fatal_.6.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.lww.com&#x2F;jtrauma&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;1991&#x2F;10000&#x2F;Deaths_...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncip.org&#x2F;zavion-johnson&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncip.org&#x2F;zavion-johnson&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0096300324001504\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S009630032...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyrille.rossant.net&#x2F;introduction-shaken-baby-syndrome-controversy&#x2F;#sec-falls\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyrille.rossant.net&#x2F;introduction-shaken-baby-syndrom...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sally_Clark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sally_Clark</a>\n\n  If you&#x27;re collecting wrongful convictions due to statistical misunderstandings, the Australian case of Kathleen Folbigg is significant.<p><pre><code>    On 4 March 2021, a petition signed by more than 100 eminent scientists was published by the Australian Academy of Science, calling for the NSW Governor to pardon Folbigg, and providing compelling scientific and medical explanations for each of the deaths.\n\n    On 5 June 2023, Kathleen Folbigg was granted an unconditional pardon.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kathleen_Folbigg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kathleen_Folbigg</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org.au&#x2F;news-and-events&#x2F;news-and-media-releases&#x2F;statement-australian-academy-science-kathleen-folbigg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org.au&#x2F;news-and-events&#x2F;news-and-media-re...</a>"

Reddit recorded a net loss of $90.8 million last year, an improvement from 2022, when its deficit came it at $158.6 million. The company said in its prospectus that it’s racked up a cumulative loss of $716.6 million.&quot;<p>Reddit&#x27;s CEO and COO made $193M and $93M in 2023 but their CFO &quot;only&quot; made $6.6M<p>So if you eliminate the CEO and COO, they have a profitable business. Given those two have tried to kill the community over and again, why keep them?\n\n  I think it&#x27;s also just a <i>bit</i> too obvious, even for the slower members of the pack, that this is nothing more or less than an attempted exit with a big payday. I suspect that Reddit has no real answer to the problems of how to be ad-friendly with a hostile user-base. I suspect that Reddit is aware it has no profitability in its future, and with the rising number of bots and bad actors dominating the place, it may not even have a future.<p>Calling it a lemon is right on the nose, and no one is more aware of what a barely-polished turd Reddit has become than its power users.\n\n    Exactly, the founders&#x2F;investors are trying to bleed it dry. Just like We Work, hopefully reddit gets slapped just as hard, they deserve it.\n\nAfter Reddit threatening to take my own (personal, bloggy) sub from me,[1] the firm gaslighted me with an IPO offer.<p>Hard pass.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36434885\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36434885</a>&gt;\n\nAs a (former) Reddit power user and moderator, I was among the first invited to participate, but passed. There was a time that Reddit actually planned to give away 10% of its stock to power users[1]. As a power user back then (in 2014), I was happy to keep the site&#x27;s best interests in mind because it was a two-way street. Most of Reddit&#x27;s success is attributable to power users like me who built mod tools and third-party apps. In return Reddit helped us build and maintain a cool community, sent us free swag, invited us to dinners, ran the Secret Santa, etc.<p>They really took a series of wrong turns since then, and today there&#x27;s a hostility between power users and Reddit inc. They took advantage of the power users that built Reddit into what it is and closed it off - no more stock for you, we&#x27;re closing off our API, disabling the apps you built, selling your data to Google, etc. Actually, instead of giving you stock, we&#x27;re giving you the &quot;opportunity&quot; to buy stock from us and give our investors some exit liquidity so they can get rich!<p>Oh well. At least I have HN where the admin&#x27;s values feel aligned with my own. If HN didn&#x27;t exist I would probably be starting my own Reddit competitor.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;reddit-fundraising&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;reddit-fundraising&#x2F;</a>"

If the social media platforms did use an algorithm that served the same kind of &quot;radicalising&quot; content, repeatedly, to a user, they should indeed be liable for brainwashing and radicalising its users (in my opinion).\n\n    What is radicalizing content?<p>Can truthful content be radicalizing? I think so. Should we therefore censor true, radicalizing content, or decline to show it to users who express interest in it? What does it mean to live in a democracy if true but radicalizing information is verboten?<p>Let&#x27;s take the example from the article, the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. It is true that the US is undergoing rapid demographic change. Should algorithms refuse to show content discussing that? It is true that some people and politicians favor this change for various reasons, ranging from in itself to for the second-order effects: eg., &quot;we need more people in order to to fund our pensions&quot;, and some do not. If someone is interested in these changes, is it brainwashing to display this related content? It is true that various US and governmental policies either directly or have the effect of promoting demographic change, and theoretically other policies could be in place that would discourage the same. Does content related to this count as &quot;radicalizing&quot; content? For some people it could be! Is it wrong in a free society to allow platforms to promote content discussing that seems like should be a very important issue? Of course, as is usual whenever you have everyman involved, there will be tons of ludicrous cranks taking all the above facts and claiming the Illuminati or the Jews are behind it all, but as seen above the line is fuzzier than it seems at first, isn&#x27;t it?<p>We live in an age where <i>lots</i> of content is radicalizing, because social anomie and atomization are huge problems. In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the conditions of the industrial era also made the populace ripe for &quot;radicalization&quot; via socialism&#x2F;communism&#x2F;fascism, all of which led to both individual (murders, beatings, assassinations) and later mass violence. But banning bookstores from promoting Karl Marx would have done nothing to stop this. The underlying social problems were the issue, not the ideological manifestations of them. No socially and psychologically healthy person reads anything and decides to kill people. But in a society where the social fabric is fraying and masses of people live unfulfilled lives, <i>something</i> will &quot;radicalize&quot; some proportion of them and they will act out in violent ways. Tuning algorithms is just playing whack-a-mole. That&#x27;s why you can go and look into these shooters and find the whole spectrum of modern beliefs has &quot;radicalized&quot; people into killing people. They&#x27;re already a lit match looking for a cause.\n\n      When good journalism flourished, newspapers and TV &quot;forced&quot; alternate views on the public too. That is the missing factor on the internet that leads to radicalisation, as you can choose to mute those alternate views and hang out in exclusive &quot;echo chambers&quot; that further harden your beliefs into political values that you do not like or want to be disputed on. It&#x27;s kind of like the virtual version of the white or black or Muslim only neighbourhoods.\n\n        When was the era of good journalism?<p>Papers in the late 1700s and early 1800s were certainly full of virulent and violent rhetoric. &quot;Yellow journalism&quot; was coined later the same century, and it was common for people to get all their news only from the party rags. It&#x27;s been my observation that people tend to think &quot;good journalism&quot; came with the era of broadcast media, where the state (in the US) was able to acquire a previously unprecedented level of control over media that everyone consumed. This created a bubble for some people that consumed mainly this media, especially as their social connections weakened, but stuff like the Fairness Doctrine did not entail actually displaying much in the way of really controversial views, which continued to propagate outside the channels of broadcast media. This <i>was</i> the echo chamber, and a lot of people are still in it; all it did was mandate that you receive the two anodyne approved opinions. It&#x27;s just that today, rather than say, reflexive anticommunism, there are new sacred cows that cannot be questioned. This echo chamber is sustained not by anonymous Twitter posters and YouTube conspiracy cranks, but by the chattering and political classes generally, and they really, really hate contrary political values and are intent on using the worst examples to silence all.<p>But also concomitant with the reign of broadcast media was, for most people in the US, good times, both socially, psychologically, and financially. Nevertheless the leading edges of the current crises were present, and you had people like Ellul influencing the Unabomber.\n\n    That&#x27;s the subject of various precedents the judge ignored. In short: You can sue Facebook for that kind of thing, but then you have to show that it likely is correct before the case can start. You can&#x27;t force Facebook into discovery just based on your own say-so.\n\n    The algorithms are tuned for engagement - a blind result of massive A&#x2F;B testing. People engage with content that causes fear, addiction, get-rich quick schemes, and ideology.<p>I quit FB years ago when I started feeling like something was off. It was once fun to see what my friends and family were up to. But, it turned into an irrational battleground of ideology of people who had never ever cared about ideology beforehand. Oldtime friends fighting and hating each other.<p>Recently, I created a new FB account to see what I was missing. Immediately, I was bombarded with videos of scantily clothed teenagers, crypto hawkers, videos that hinted at Human&#x27;s darker side. The friends that were still active were exclusively peddling memes of extremism. That experiment didn&#x27;t last long.<p>I&#x27;m currently avoiding every platform that algorithmically decides what content to show me (except YouTube which generally shows me content that&#x27;s interesting and useful to me). It&#x27;s a relief to my mental health. And, I realize how much of my day was wasted with content that had no use to me."

It&#x27;s essentially a metric of expected goals based on all the shots that have been taken, and factors in things like where the shot was taken etc... Yet I&#x27;ve always thought that it was an imperfect metric as it didn&#x27;t take into account things like opportunity cost of shooting when you could have passed to someone with a higher xG, or even the position of all the defenders &#x2F; keeper when you&#x27;re shooting. It would be cool if we could use a system like this to better understand the xG based on all of those factors and more. Basically, for any given position where we take the entire field and players even, into account, what is the actual xG."

Humans make mistakes.<p>Claude is in many ways superior to ChatGPT, reverse is also true.\n\nAll AI is untrustworthy. Many people have been saying this since the start, and there&#x27;s not really any evidence that AI will or can attain perfection. Set your expectations accordingly.<p>P.S.: There is no greener pasture. If you&#x27;ve been following the scene since the BERT&#x2F;GPT-2 days, it becomes readily apparent how &quot;far&quot; text generators have come. They got bigger, more expensive, slower, censored, and 10-20% better at solving human reasoning problems. There is no light at the tunnel suggesting infallible LLMs are coming. You are being sold a moving goalpost.\n\n  Not true. Things have degraded considerably for ChatGPT.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s just a stochastic mechanism but there are degrees of accuracy and they have gone down lately.\n\n  If you set your expectations accordingly, I find ChatGPT answers fairly helpful. At least for my experience.\n\n    I actually tend to agree. My struggle is with people that sensationalize the untrustworthiness of AI when it has been plainly apparent since day-zero.\n\nI&#x27;m not sure if I conciously noticed it but I did notice today that I just haven&#x27;t been using ChatGPT or LLMs for any programming tasks for the past two weeks or so. I think it has been giving progressively worse answers or I&#x27;ve just hit the limits of how useful I find it. Claude isn&#x27;t available in my region but maybe it&#x27;s worth a try.\n\n  You can try Claude 3 through Poe.\n\nI mean for anything you could have easily verified via a search engine, I would say you always should have been verifying. I&#x27;ve had ChatGPT give me incorrect but correct-seeming information many times, and not just in the last several weeks.\n\nYou completely misunderstand LLMs if you think they ever were &quot;reliable&quot; in the first place. All it is, is a plausible text autocompleter.\n\nUse an LLM that searches for answers online, like Bing Copilot or Google Gemini.\n\nAll LLMs are inherently untrustworthy, they can be great to get the ball rolling so to speak but you have to double check everything they generate which is its own kind of overhead.\n\nIn other news, Google returns spam sites and Excel parses dates incorrectly.<p>How is this ramble of a post became front page on HN is beyond me.\n\nI have experienced such issues with GPT-4 returning the wrong syntax, especially when asking questions about complex operations in Polars.<p>We are actually running performance monitoring for GPT-3.5&#x2F;4 and Claude-2 to systematically track such regressions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.uptrain.ai&#x2F;benchmark&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.uptrain.ai&#x2F;benchmark&#x2F;</a>. We would be curious to know your thoughts and feedback.\n\nOf course, because it was inherently trustworthy before. Goddamn, we&#x27;re all lost, aren&#x27;t we? Either that or you&#x27;re really into believing the hype.\n\nI was testing ChatGPT&#x27;s ability to access current events and asked it if it knows about the &quot;bloodbath&quot; controversy. Just that word. It briefly described the mainstream media&#x27;s version of events. I asked it a few different ways if it was aware of another interpretation, it was not.<p>Its media bubble appears to be robust. I suppose if you trust  the mainstream media that&#x27;s a feature."

Same with the individual. We have limited useful lifespan. Above that we’re a burden on society.\n\n    Unless we can keep peak performance indefinitely. Think of all the thousands of specialists that die each year carrying with them an immense amount of acquired knowledge.\n\n      That&#x27;s not at all how our lifecycle works.<p>We grow up young, inexperienced, eager to learn, eager to try things and fail, our metabolism is much higher than needed, in order to compensate for this frantic phase of our lives.<p>Then as we settle, and slow down, the best are selected and assigned positions of responsibility. As they carry out their tasks, they get set in their ways and learn less, and repeat more. Eventually they become outdated, and need to be replaced with the next generation, or they begin to stall progress by insisting their way is better.<p>It&#x27;s not an issue of health, it&#x27;s an issue of entropy. Our brains are not designed to learn forever. We do learn a bit to the day we die, but not deeply. To learn forever, the way you learned as you were young, means you constantly risk losing yourself. This is dangerous when you&#x27;re in a position of power. You need to reduce mutability as you increase your leverage, to maintain a steady course into a known direction everyone can follow along with.<p>You can&#x27;t be a careless child and an adult leader at the same time. Those are incompatible roles. They have the extreme opposite of requirements.<p>There&#x27;s no such moment of &quot;peak performance&quot; that you can hold onto. It&#x27;s a wave, an oscillation. You&#x27;re born, you grow, you learn, you&#x27;re selected, you give back, then you retire to be consulted by the next generation only when they need you.<p>If thousands of specialists die before they give what they found useful to the next generation, they&#x27;ve failed at their purpose.<p>To record knowledge, to replicate it, we have speech, spoken, written, visual media, telephony, internet, videos, media in general. We have everything we need.<p>But it&#x27;s the role of the next generation to take this in and refract it through their always evolving understanding.<p>Nothing is static. Only immutable nothingness is static. Unchanging. To try to hold onto something forever, unchanging, to live forever, is the same as death.\n\nIt’s not just iso.

A declining birthrate is a sign that the group is no longer flourishing. Each generation is able to squeeze fewer and fewer copies of their genes through the barrier that separates one from the next. The barrier is comprised of the environment and the challenges of life that we are all faced with. The more copies of genes that make it through this barrier, the more successful the originals were at facing modernity.<p>From this standpoint, it is clear that the dominant cultures of the world are in decline.

I never say that so you did not read or failed to comprehend.<p>What &quot;unconstitutional act&quot; is the AfD advocating for? German original source with quote or you are lying.\n\n  LOL my dude, they literally want to expel citizens with immigration background, how the hell is that a centrist position?<p>Also, do your really think the solution for Ukraine is to let it get taken over? That is absurdly shortsighted.\n\n    Another idiot who can&#x27;t read, I was speaking in generalities and the media. The political landscape has shifted so far to the left that what is centrist, or what was considered centrist like 5 or 10 years ago is called by &quot;right wing&quot; by the propaganda media all the time. It happens in the US as well. I never called the AfD centrist.<p>Stop reading and believing propaganda. Well, learn to read first I guess.<p>And the solution for Ukraine is to keep their promise to Putin to stay a neutral state and not get sucked into the starting point for WW3 by the US and NATO. The solution is to start talking to Putin and make a peace deal and tell NATO to fuck off. The solution is not to be &quot;taken over&quot;. Putin only attacked because they were going to try to become and NATO member, something they explicitly said they would NOT do. But of course you know nothing about the history and are a stupid NPC who says. &quot;Orange man bad.&quot;, &quot;Putin bad.&quot;<p>I bet you still believe in the Russia collusion hoax. ROFL.\n\n      &gt; the solution for Ukraine is to keep their promise to Putin to stay a neutral state<p>&gt; Putin only attacked because they were going to try to become and NATO member, something they explicitly said they would NOT do<p>Can you cite any sources or did you make that up?\n\n      &gt; the solution for Ukraine is to keep their promise to Putin to stay a neutral state<p>What promise? Is that written down anywhere?<p>&gt; Putin only attacked because they were going to try to become and NATO member, something they explicitly said they would NOT do<p>Were they? Putin invaded after Euromaidan, which was, as the name implies, about getting close to the EU.<p>Oh btw, Sweden and Finland just joined NATO. Why didn&#x27;t he invade those?"

You head to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) website and check out the status of the application (or, more often, pre-application). In this case you google NRC and Terrapower, and end up here [1]. There you get some general information, and also a link to the &quot;docket&quot;. You can go there and there&#x27;s some searches you can perform, for example you can find the documents filed this month.<p>The document that was filed today (20-March-2024) is [2]  and has an impossibly long name that starts with &quot;Readiness Assessment&quot; and ends with &quot;Construction Permit Draft Application&quot;. The gist of it is that TerraPower submitted the said draft application in January this year, and the NRC has reviewed this draft. Their observations can fall in 3 categories: A, B and C. A means you have a serious gap. B means you need to add some more info, and C is milder than B, it&#x27;s something like, you are allowed to not add more info if you are really tired and exhausted, but if you do, we don&#x27;t promise not to be upset.<p>The great news is that there were no category A findings. There were 30 category B, and about 100 category C findings.<p>Overall, it does look like TerraPower is making nice progress with the NRC.

I started with Ollama because its codebase is Go. In reality Ollama does not even take full advantage of llama.cpp itself as it does not implement concurrency plus adds latency using json in a CGO call. I discovered that building the wasm plugin, I was disappointed, and it&#x27;s not on the ollama priorities to solve that see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ollama&#x2F;ollama&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3170\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ollama&#x2F;ollama&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3170</a><p>Another advantage of Ollama is it can easily run locally, so does the wasm plugin. Accomplishing the goal of local development environment which uses dreamland.<p>That&#x27;s great feedback. I was thinking about fixing the concurrency issue myself, but creating a vLLM wasm plugin is a better idea. The user code won&#x27;t need to change as long as the plugin exports as the same wasm host module.\n\n    I&#x27;m with you. I think having an optimized production inference serving framework on the deployment side has the potential to make your project the best of all worlds, essentially.<p>Of course there are other really advanced use cases and alternative ways to go about this but that would go a very long way.<p>Also FWIW Nvidia Triton Inference server is even more performant than vLLM and supports dynamic batching, quantization, paging, KV cache, blah blah blah in addition to being able to load multiple models today whether they be LLMs, ONNX, whatever across all of the available backends.<p>Significantly more complex in terms of deployment but wanted to mention it in terms of being able to load multiple models concurrently in an efficient and performant manner.\n\n      I took a look at Nvidia Triton Inference server, and it might be a good option for production especially as it has c++ api.<p>Amazing feedback, Thanks!"

Instead, they&#x27;re living the &quot;YOLO Instagram life&quot; because they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it work like a slave just to own a home and have nothing else.\n\n    yeah - who knew that being barely able to cover your basic needs but nothing else would cause the younger generation to be less optimistic about the future? Preposterous I tell you!\n\n    Would be interesting to check the numbers when controlling for income&#x2F;affluence. Intuitively I actually think that the &quot;always online&quot; thing is a big part of it, but don&#x27;t have any numbers to back that up.<p>There&#x27;s a few things that happen on social media that make me think this. First, there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;aspirational&quot; content - &quot;unboxing&quot; expensive clothes, cars, etc. People hanging out in fancy houses or going to exotic locales. All of this is classic marketing stuff and IIRC has been linked to unhappiness in the past.<p>Second, there&#x27;s constant political hyperbole online. Though maybe it&#x27;s just the filter bubbles I hang out with. It&#x27;s difficult to be happy when it seems that everyone is trying to convince you that the world will end if the next election doesn&#x27;t go a certain way.<p>Finally, and this probably applies to younger people more, there&#x27;s a flood of unrealistic body&#x2F;face imagery on social media. While there were examples of this before (fashion&#x2F;fitness mags) it seems harder to escape now. It&#x27;s especially bad when you hear stories of people getting plastic surgery to look like the facetune version of themselves[1]. Now the aspirational image is not someone else - it&#x27;s literally yourself run through photoshop.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5357262&#x2F;snapchat-plastic-surgery&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5357262&#x2F;snapchat-plastic-surgery&#x2F;</a>\n\n    I can see Gen Z having issues, but I&#x27;m a millennial and I bought my house 9 years ago.  Homes were very affordable.  Rent for me from college -&gt; this time was also very affordable.  I heard the same arguments 10+ years ago: things are too expensive&#x2F;I can never afford a house, when it just wasn&#x27;t true.<p>&quot;because they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it work like a slave just to own a home and have nothing else.&quot;<p>Too many people I knew in college partied and spent all of their money on booze, drugs, and the latest gadgets for years during college and many years after.<p>I saved my money and never had the latest smart phone until a few years ago.  I don&#x27;t think I went on a single vacation (besides some weekend trips) during my 20s.\n\n      These sorts of anecdotes don&#x27;t seem so useful without more demographic and geographic context.<p>When I moved into my first rental at 23 in 2015 in a suburb of Vancouver, the owners of the new condo were <i>probably</i> also millennial, just on the upper end. I was paying ~1450 CAD which was relatively very high for the time, but I couldn&#x27;t find another viable place and was already by that time stuck in a monthly airbnb. They said they bought it for around ~250k. Not necessarily an extreme amount, if I already had years of income and luck on my side. Fast forward to post-pandemic, and now I have even less in absolute dollars, while the same place has more than doubled in price, and rent has probably increased by about $800&#x2F;m.<p>Now 32, prosperity of normie standards pretty much seems out the door, so instead I&#x27;ll occasionally spend a bit more on adventure, but much less frivolously than I think boomers and home-owning millennials tend to. The cost of a 2 weeker in a different continent can be less than the tax on a car. Fwiw I&#x27;ve also always been extremely frugal, but do now value my community more than money, because <i>when</i> you lose your job or face real hardship, you&#x27;ll need the people you were already investing your time in.<p>Whether a millennial owns a home or now comes down to a few factors; what do they earn, how long have they earned it, where do they live, and did they get inheritance. If you&#x27;ve never lost a job, live in a LCOL area, are frugal, and got in earlier, great.\n\n      &gt; I&#x27;m a millennial and I bought my house 9 years ago. Homes were very affordable.<p>And then, what? You stopped looking at interest rates and wages? You magically became an honorary &quot;I got mine&quot; boomer when the real estate agent handed you the keys?<p>&gt;  I don&#x27;t think I went on a single vacation (besides some weekend trips) during my 20s.<p>My reduction in consumption of avocado toast has, predictably, done fuck all for lowering interest rates or increasing housing supply.\n\n      I am actually revisiting this and doing some mental math in my head.<p>You bought in 2013? Really? <i>Seriously</i>? Like, this isn&#x27;t a tongue-in-cheek joke? The smugness of looking at your mortgage payment isn&#x27;t enough? You just <i>had</i> to come here to project your &quot;I deserve this more, timing  and luck are nothing&quot; bullshit here?<p>Wow, I do a decent job of detaching nowadays but I&#x27;d pay for the chance to tell you to your face, where to stick your analysis.<p>edit: wow, this exchange, and this thread in general is just so <i>chefs kiss</i>. Amazing, stunning, fabulous. If only I could be so god damn ignorant and self-assured, what I might achieve. (Or, you know, leveraging cash during an economic downturn, galaxy-brain there!).\n\n  Good reasons implies that there are bad reasons, but I&#x27;d think there are just reasons. I suppose one question I would ask is are Gen Z and Millennials more online than Gen X and Boomers? I suppose that&#x27;s the stereotype, but Facebook also has the reputation as a Boomer site these days; certainly my mother is a fan. And Boomers are not Greatest&#x2F;Silent Generation - my dad bought a 486 in the 90&#x27;s and told me not to tell my mom how much he spent, despite not needing one for any real practical reason. Boomers aren&#x27;t helpless around technology; their generation invented most of the modern incarnations of it, and they had to learn to use it throughout their careers.\n\n  Let&#x27;s recap some potential reasons:<p>- Inability to afford a house during their lifetime leaves them with the sole options of living with parents or renting with housemates.<p>- Significant artificial inflation in consumer goods, no solution in sight.<p>- A troubled job market: low wages, lack of employee protection or rights, no mandated paid time off, or unlimited sick leave. Attempts to unionize can result in termination.<p>- A challenging dating scene, influenced by numerous factors.<p>- Same in the political scene, where left&#x2F;right, red&#x2F;blue parties are irrelevant because nothing is changing.<p>- A decline in community engagement or lack of, with online platforms and technology playing a role, though not exclusively.<p>These are just a few examples. Now, take a look at Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, we can see how these issues undermine the basic three levels, including the safety of shelter, employment, belonging, etc., and then you see some articles like this as if it is a surprise why it is the case.. unfortunately, the older generation screwed up and failed the new one.\n\n    Also:<p>- Remote work being pulled by ancient management (average age of US F500 CEO is 58) even though quality of life bump is proven.<p>- If kids are desired, they cost $310k 0-18 (Brookings Institute 2023) each, not including daycare and college.<p>EDIT: - Climate change data and early impacts being realized.<p>&gt; unfortunately, the older generation screwed up and failed the new one.<p>This is the crux. Great comment overall. Society grows great when trees are planted whose shade we won&#x27;t sit in; instead, we clear cut the place. A whole cohort is trapped in a dysfunctional socioeconomic system they didn&#x27;t build, but are forced to exist in.

I am wondering, if working from home is here to stay, wouldn&#x27;t companies start hiring talents from global market rather then paying extra for US employees if they still work remotely? Is it not &quot;wiser&quot; from the company point of view to hire talented people for instance from Eastern Europe which have more competitive salary expectations (due to lower cost of living) than American counterparts?\n\n        You see these attempts every few years, with the work coming back with nearshoring and re-onshoring. How confident are you in the hiring processes of most major corps that they can find diamonds in LCOL global geographies? I am not confident. They can&#x27;t even figure out hiring locally. It&#x27;s also a lot harder to seek legal recourse when the employee is out of your jurisdictional reach.<p>(20+ years in tech, ymmv, n=1, thoughts and opinions my own)\n\n          I am not sure about diamonds but I was involved recruiting software engineers in London City a few years ago using the best recruitment agencies they were back then on the market. Let me tell you, it was a disaster. I do not know whether this was specific to UK, industry or time period but it was a joke. I do not see a reason why broader pool of potential candidates is worse then geographically limited selection, if permanent working from home is on the table.\n\n            &gt; it was a disaster<p>Was the testing just leetcode crap, or was it based on actually being able to get stuff done? ;)\n\n              That&#x27;s the problem - it was just for senior developers, not rocket scientists. Most of candidates (curated by agencies) have poor coding skills, soft skills non-existent. So we didn&#x27;t even dream of people who can get the job done and be independent.\n\n                Hmmm, bad salary range for the location maybe?<p>If it&#x27;s something you can share, do you remember what the salary range was roughly?\n\n        Have you tried running a team in Eastern Europe?\n\n          Actually, we do - in Poland, but most developers are from Ukraine. All other operations stays in UK. The salaries leveled up after a few years, but it is still slightly more cost effective comparing to UK. But the actual skill levels and work attitude is night and day. That&#x27;s why I am perplexed that so many US software engineers want to stand their ground in terms of working from home policy, potentially exposing themselves to compete on a global market while big software houses like Microsoft or Google cutting jobs like there is no tomorrow.\n\n            Because no one wants to live like the lowest global common denominator.\n\n              You are exactly right! So why give up one of the biggest trump card - locality, and allow free access for other people from around the world to your job market because you want to work permanently from home.\n\n                How does requiring staff to come into an office stop a company from hiring remotely globally? The only solution is unionization and nation state regulation. If you don&#x27;t have labor representation, there are no controls on corporate behavior besides shareholder interests.\n\n                  You&#x27;re spot on and I totally agree with you. But pushing hard for remote work might backfire for current IT folks. If bosses get comfy with everyone being remote, they&#x27;ll wonder why stick to local talent when they can hire from anywhere in the world.<p>Sure, companies can and do hire globally, but at the same time managers still want most of the people to appear in the office from time to time (for whatever reason). But if IT guys demand working permanently from home, then it changes everything. Suddenly, being local doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore, and the job could be done by someone halfway across the globe. Be careful what you wish for; demanding remote work is a double-edge sword which could make lots of positions way less secure.\n\n                    The positions are already insecure, we have nowhere to go but up.\n\n        Scandinavia would be a safer bet. Especially Finland has pretty low salaries in IT but more skilled people than USA.<p>But it&#x27;s not that simple. Cultural differences, timezone differences, the inability to meet face to face all make the employment relationship less effective.\n\n      There is unrest in the forest.\n\n    &gt; - Significant artificial inflation in consumer goods, no solution in sight.<p>I don&#x27;t put a lot of stock in this. Inflation was double digits ~10% a few times in the 70s due to the oil shocks. And the FED interest rate was &gt;10% as well. What we have now is nothing close to that.<p>Where inflation <i>has</i> been impactful is housing&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;education. Consumer goods are quite cheap thought, all things considered.<p>&gt; - A challenging dating scene, influenced by numerous factors.<p>Those factors <i>are</i> largely social media. Tinder is not a good way to find a stable relationship in my experience. But online dating is considered the default for many younger people. There&#x27;s also unrealistic expectations created by watching a constant stream of Instagram influencers.\n\n      &gt; Consumer goods are quite cheap thought, all things considered.<p>New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley was famously heckled for this point.<p>&gt; Dudley said said that while food prices may be rising, the cost of some other goods are going down, which evens out the overall inflation picture. The Fed&#x27;s inflation estimates do not take into account volatile energy or food prices. The crowd was not impressed:<p>&gt; &quot;Today you can buy an iPad 2 that costs the same as an iPad 1 that is twice as powerful,&quot; he said referring to Apple Inc&#x27;s (AAPL.O) latest handheld tablet computer hitting stories on Friday.<p>&gt; &quot;You have to look at the prices of all things,&quot; he said.<p>&gt; This prompted guffaws and widespread murmuring from the audience, with one audience member calling the comment &quot;tone deaf.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;I can&#x27;t eat an iPad,&quot; another quipped.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;us-usa-fed-dudley-ipad-idUSTRE72A4D520110311&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;us-usa-fed-dudley...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;lookout&#x2F;fed-official-heckled-t-eat-ipad-20110311-122230-439.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;lookout&#x2F;fed-official-heckl...</a>\n\n        Food inflation is also nowhere near what was seen in the 70s.\n\n          <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;economy&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;its-been-30-years-since-food-ate-up-this-much-of-your-income-2e3dd3ed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;economy&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;its-been-30-years-sinc...</a> | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.today&#x2F;65jOR\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.today&#x2F;65jOR</a> (&quot;It’s Been 30 Years Since Food Ate Up This Much of Your Income&quot;)\n\n            I don&#x27;t get what this is meant to prove. The 1990s are often regarded as a golden era. So we&#x27;re spending as much on food as we did in 1994 and that&#x27;s supposed to make people unhappy?<p>I understand that housing&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;education has gotten a lot more expensive since then, but saying that food prices are back to where they were in the 90s is not very persuasive for the idea that food inflation is making people unhappy.\n\n              I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re making the connection between financial stress and unhappiness. Decades ago, price to wages were very favorable. Now, they are not, causing financial stress across cohorts without much earning or purchasing power, leading to unhappiness. Food costs are component, but not the entire picture.\n\n        Referencing the advancement of technology is doubly tone deaf, as tech points out the fundamental problem with the artificial inflation aspect of their mandate. If you had $3000 in the 1990&#x27;s, you could buy a 33MHz 486 with a 14&quot; CRT. Or you could have buried the money as cash under a rock, dug it out in 2024, and bought a desktop, laptop, tablet, <i>and</i> phone that each dwarfed the capabilities of the 486. Yet you would have been utterly stupid do the latter, considering all you would have missed out on. Technology is the glaring example that shows today&#x27;s consumption does not depend on the threat of prices being higher tomorrow.<p>But sure, if one still wants to toe the party line that artificial inflation is necessary, that <i>still</i> doesn&#x27;t justify all of the resulting newly created money having been given to the financial sector as low interest loans just to bid up an asset bubble and create a bunch of make-work white collar jobs shuffling the paperwork. That money could have instead been spent for deliberate purposes, like infrastructure and mitigating the societal damage from offshoring (yet another thing that would have caused natural deflation had it been allowed). But all that wealth was basically looted under the auspices of &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot;, leaving Wall Street incredibly rich (and bloated), while continually turning the financial screws on Main Street.\n\n          Can you explain what you mean by &quot;artificial inflation&quot;? For example, much of the 1970s inflation was caused by a spike in energy prices because of an oil embargo from OPEC countries. Is this artificial inflation (because it was precipitated by political decisions) or real inflation (because a necessary commodity got more expensive)?\n\n            I would call that real inflation, as it&#x27;s the market responding to an external event, even though that event is human-made.<p>Artificial inflation is what we had for the past three decades where even though resources were plentiful and things were getting less expensive to produce (eg offshoring, technology), prices were still going up a few percent per year because the Fed&#x27;s mandate is to artificially create even more new money to prevent the deflation bogeyman. In other words &quot;moving production to Mexico&#x2F;China may cost us some jobs but will be made up for by lower prices for everyone&quot; was ultimately a lie due to Fed policy making lower prices impossible.\n\n            Most people use the term &quot;artificial inflation&quot; to reference the price of products going up for no real-world reason, or when the company lies about the reason. (As in, the price increase is explainable entirely -- or almost entirely, in higher margins for the company), but that the company blames on &quot;inflation&quot; anyway.<p>If &quot;Company X&quot; is publicly saying &quot;our prices are higher because of inflation&quot;, but you can also clearly see that their costs are not meaningfully different and their margins are higher, simply because the market has no alternative but to eat them, that&#x27;s &quot;artificial inflation&quot;.\n\n        &gt; &quot;I can&#x27;t eat an iPad,&quot; another quipped.<p>Imagine being able to do <i>anything</i> useful with an iPad except buy new ones. My 3rd gen has always been and is now marginally closer to a brick\n\n      <i>optional</i> consumer goods may be cheaper.<p>Necessary consumer goods are not.<p>A cynic would say companies selling necessary goods have realized that they can price gouge because people don’t have a choice about paying, and then claim inflation is the reason despite that being demonstrably false.<p>Then you have continued conglomeration of intermediaries which has meant while the consumer price has been increasing the amount going to the producers has been reducing. Almost like the “efficiencies” used to justify mergers are built on monopoly exploitation.\n\n    In the 1960s, you could temp at a diner for a few weeks before snagging up a 2br&#x2F;2ba on the GI bill, look to your partner who you met organically at a sock hop, and say to each other (in unison): &quot;We can finally afford 2.1 children.&quot; And then you live happily ever after until today, when you die at around 80.\n\n      &gt; die at around 80<p>Or, you blow past that and die at 88, 93, 99 like my family seems predisposed to do. Of course with a staunch reprehension for assisted living and no means to pay for it if you wanted to.\n\n    Totally agree. I think there&#x27;s a deep sense that &quot;things are getting worse&quot; across the board, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much hope that the trends will reverse anytime soon.\n\n&quot;Millenials killed happiness.&quot;\n\nHow can one be happy when they have 1&#x2F;4 of net worth compare to their parents at the same age ?\n\n  Maybe people are less happy because they belive viral misinformation?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economistwritingeveryday.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;who-is-the-wealthiest-generation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economistwritingeveryday.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;who-is-the-w...</a><p>There are a lot more boomers so they had more wealth in total but when viewed per capita millennials have similar wealth at the same age.\n\n    Not just similar wealth but — as you source indicates and other sources indicate — <i>more</i>!<p>It’s an indication of how powerful narrative is: despite the facts, folks just believe what they want to believe.\n\nAlternative reasons:<p>1)\nMore than 2 in 5 adults (42.4%) have obesity in the US.<p>2)\nWealth is very unevenly distributed compared to Europe.<p>Being rich does not make you much happier. At least not enough that 10% rich people can compensate for 50% poor people.<p>GDP per capita gives a skewed image for happiness, you have to get the percentage that struggles financially."

The article doesn&#x27;t even mention consoles which I guess make sense because it&#x27;s &quot;PC&quot; gamer, but still.\n\n  PCs still outsell consoles by a large margin.<p>If ChatGPT and some rudimentary Googling can be trusted, Sony has sold a total of 50 million PS5 consoles so far in three years.<p>For comparison, about 240 million PCs are sold per year.\n\n    &gt; For comparison, about 240 million PCs are sold per year.<p>Also for comparison: Apple alone sells around that many smartphones per year.  And they&#x27;re not nearly the biggest manufacturer.  I don&#x27;t think any major phone manufacturer uses Intel CPUs.\n\n      They don’t make mobile chips for phones…<p>They have tried a few times, but were too power hungry and didn’t have the volume to justify it, so they went back to their bread and butter\n\n  Stats they looked at are for desktop &amp; laptops, so consoles are not considered. Neither are servers, which I suspect is mostly Intel too still. They also haven&#x27;t looked at tablets, so all those M2&#x27;s in iPads are not counted. Not sure if that is significant.\n\n  The Switch uses Nvidia, but no console since (I believe) the original Xbox has used Intel, yes.\n\nTheir momentum and influence on OEMs is massive.<p>While I&#x27;m not a mainstream user, and it&#x27;s hard to wrap my head around choosing a hot, power hungry Intel chip over something from Apple or AMD, just walk into any store (or go to an online store) that sells laptops. 90% of your options will be powered by Intel. Most consumers are going to buy what&#x27;s readily available. Most businesses (corporate, maybe not &quot;tech&quot;) will continue to buy what they always have.\n\n  They&#x27;re selling everything they make anyway. There isn&#x27;t enough fabs on Earth to saturate demand.\n\nIntel is back baby\n\nApparently they&#x27;re not counting any of the mobile CPUs in their numbers ... because there is no way in the last quarter Apple &quot;only&quot; shipped 6 million iPhones<p>And Samsung sure shipped more than that\n\n  This is what the PC Gamer article says:<p>&gt; global PC shipments<p>&gt; desktop and laptop CPUs\n\n    The PC is becoming increasingly irrelevant. &quot;Personal&quot; computing happens on phones now.\n\n    so ... a pretty meaningless article<p>thanks for the confirmation :)<p>server, mobile, etc are <i>far</i> bigger than &quot;PC&quot; ever was\n\nAlmost nobody in their right mind (except gamers) would buy an Intel CPU - when people do, it&#x27;s usually because system vendors only offer or strongly favor Intel <i>cough</i>Dell<i>cough</i>.<p>Intel CPUs are slightly faster with a small number of threads, which is mostly useful for games. Intel desktop mainboards also seem to be less fiddly to set up. Intel CPUs are slower in heavy multi-core loads and much less power efficient than AMD, especially when both are power limited. AMD CPUs have a very flat power-performance curve, Intel not so much.\n\n  I built a 7700X system as an upgrade to my previous i9-9900K system.  Performance and efficiency wise it&#x27;s fantastic, but I&#x27;ve had TONS of problems.  Memory unable to run at its rated speed, GPU not initializing at boot, glacially slow boot times even with MCR enabled, janky BIOS releases...<p>My old-old system is a Haswell Xeon E3 in a Dell and that sucker can boot from power button to the Windows 11 login screen before the monitor even wakes up on the Ryzen.<p>I really, really hope Intel can release something competitive with AMD in the efficiency space.  I feel guilty using more electricity than absolutely necessary, but I also don&#x27;t want to spend my evenings troubleshooting.\n\n    I have read something on Reddit that seems to make MCR actually work nicely on Asus boards (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Asus at this point, but I have one). You have to enable MCR in BOTH places in the BIOS. Under DRAM timings under the &quot;A.I. Tweaker&quot; tab (also enable &quot;DRAM Power Down Mode&quot; there, happened automatically for me when enabling MCR) and under... I forgot... something like CPU features, MCU, MCU features, Memory Context Restore. Boot time is pretty fast for me now, I think it&#x27;s better than on the previous Asus AM4 board, which was also not bad.\n\n    New socket and new DDR standard teething, mostly, probably. Granted Intel seems to be doing a much better job with DDR5, so there&#x27;s no excuse really for AMD.<p>For best results on AM5 prefer two-DIMM (1DPC) configurations, DDR5-6000 kits with EXPO, and avoid the Samsung B-die stuff (e.g. G.SKILL FlareX 36-36-36). If that&#x27;s too complicated or whatever I would suggest waiting for Ryzen 9000 and the next wave of AM5 boards where this should all be ironed out, or go with Intel LGA1700 this generation.<p>Personally I am waiting for 64GB DDR5 UDIMMs and stable four-DIMM (2DPC) configurations before I can even contemplate upgrading from AM4. And since I&#x27;m already waiting I also want to see a faster chipset link (B650&#x2F;X670 are still just PCIe Gen4 x4) and TB5 on my next board.\n\n      I unfortunately have the exact kit of ram you mentioned to avoid, it came with the Microcenter bundle.<p>I live ~2.5 hours from Microcenter, so I took a gamble-- reviews were very mixed but the price was insane.  If I had bought this setup from my local BestBuy or online, I&#x27;d have returned it.<p>What&#x27;s your plan if you can get that 256GB RAM config?  Run some full-fat LLM&#x27;s on your iGPU?\n\n        &gt; What&#x27;s your plan if you can get that 256GB RAM config? Run some full-fat LLM&#x27;s on your iGPU?<p>No, mostly running lots of VMs and databases, which tend to chew up a ton of RAM. And I dabble in a few cryptocurrency projects that can be a bit RAM-heavy and&#x2F;or sometimes benefit from a fast RAM disk.<p>I actually downgraded, going from 256GB on X99 to 128GB on AM4, so it&#x27;ll be nice to get back to 256GB with modern features and CPU performance (without having to spend thousands of dollars on Threadripper or Xeon W).\n\n  I only came to the comments to see if my instinct (which matches your first sentence) was corroborated. I no longer do anything that particularly requires a cutting edge CPU, I&#x27;ve an M1 Pro MBP and an M2 Mac Studio and they&#x27;re so far beyond fast enough for me. I&#x27;ve been toying with building a linux box for home but if I do it&#x27;ll definitely be ARM - fast enough, low power, low heat - perfect.\n\n    Apple CPU&#x27;s are well-implemented, wide and on a cutting edge process.  That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re fast &amp; efficient.   In 2024 the architecture has approximately nothing to with it.\n\n      I&#x27;m an idiot when it comes to chips, but the one thing I thought I knew was that ARM CPUs run considerably cooler and more efficient in terms of performance per watt, especially compared to Intel. Isn&#x27;t that why they&#x27;re in every mobile device?\n\n        It&#x27;s historical.   In the 80&#x27;s when an extra 10,000 transistors for decode could be 20% of the chip, ARM had an efficiency advantage.   So it got used in certain markets.   Which meant chips were designed for that market.   So because there were chips specifically designed for the market, they were used.   Feedback loop, essentially.\n\n          Your explanation is great except for the beginning of the story: in the 80s and early 90s, CISC cores didn&#x27;t have a CISC to RISC decoder frontend - they implemented complex instructions directly (though with the help of microcode). The size penalty of that was more like 300%, and it was slower, too(!). RISC was a really big deal at the time. It was even mentioned in the, ahem, documentary &quot;Hackers&quot; from 1995.\n\n            A &quot;CISC to RISC decoder&quot; isn&#x27;t properly a decoder, it&#x27;s a translator.    What they had in the 80&#x27;s were proper decoders: instruction&#x27;s in, enable and clock lines out.\n\n              I don&#x27;t want to argue about that. My point is just that the size (transistor count) and performance differences were massive at the time, like 2-3x the performance at 1&#x2F;4th or so of the size.\n\n          Thanks for the explanation!\n\n  &gt; Almost nobody in their right mind (except gamers) would buy an Intel CPU<p>I recently was at a computer shop (looking for keyboard repair) and someone brought in their PC because it kept freezing, ended up they are getting a new PC and even when the salesperson recommended an AMD based PC the guy said that he didn&#x27;t want to because he didn&#x27;t have good experiences with AMD. Mind you that PC had an Intel 6000 series CPU in it, so best case that experience likely is 10+ years ago.<p>I kinda died inside while standing there.\n\n    I wanted to buy an AMD laptop for my work, but as soon as I read about AMD CPUs are running hotter than Intel, I decided to stay with Intel. \nBecause I run on Intel since 20 years and I know what I get when I buy one. With AMD I can&#x27;t be sure and I don&#x27;t have the time to find out. Just give me a working laptop, I don&#x27;t care about benchmarks.\n\n      Dunno. With quality laptops, the fiddliness of the platform is the laptop manufacturer&#x27;s problem. My AMD Thinkpad is just as dumb (basically no performance-related options, but the preset is fine) and reliable as my previous Intel Thinkpads. And there&#x27;s no reason why a CPU would run hotter at the same power consumption and cooling solution. Probably different biases in the thermal sensors or whatever.\n\n  AMD desktop chiplet CPUs draw almost 3x power compared to Intel at idle. It makes a huge difference in overall power consumption. Of course they are much more efficient in the top end, but my PC is not running full load most of the time, so I don&#x27;t see that efficiency.<p>Of course their monolithic CPUs are much better (just look at the APU in the Steam Deck), but you can&#x27;t buy them directly. They are either an APU or only available in laptops.<p>So, I stick to Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU for the power efficiency. I can&#x27;t even switch to AMD GPUs because they are bad even at top end.\n\n    In Windows or Linux? Or have you tested both?\n\n      Both, it is an inherent drawback of using chiplets.\n\n    {admittedly, my experience (since about 2000) with AMD has been dominantly server <i>not</i> workstation&#x2F;laptop}<p>i have found AMD x86-64 CPUs to be <i>overwhelmingly better</i> than intel&#x27;s poor mimicking of AMD&#x27;s innovation!<p>If you want to live in x64-64 Land ... AMD is the winner. Hands down. And <i>has</i> been for a quarter century.\n\n  The world is full people who say things like &quot;I used an AMD video card or CPU once in 1967 and it had driver problems, never again.&quot;\n\n    I&#x27;m one of those people. The thing is, I try again every decade or so, and every time without fail there are issues. Intel is the 1990s Apple of the CPU world. &quot;It just works&quot;, and I&#x27;ll pay a fairly high premium for that.\n\n  a gamer would wind up with worse power efficiency from an intel CPU because of how much wattage they draw under load, there&#x27;s a reason i&#x27;m on ryzen and not core atm\n\n  Meh, I recently built 7700X and 13700K towers. Both with premium ASUS motherboards. The Intel one was faster, the CPU was cheaper when I bought it, it booted insanely fast compared to the AMD system and it accepted the overclocked RAM without fuss or tinkering. On top of that it ran cooler (even though it uses more wattage at load) and had true Thunderbolt (rather than USB4) out of the box. It’s also well known that AMD systems use much more power at idle.\n\nI&#x27;m not fond of Intel, but I recently bought a laptop with an Intel CPU. I&#x27;m stuck with them for a few more years. My PC is already AMD-based, and I loved the new mobile CPUs from AMD, but they are either hardly available or in undesired packages (bulky gaming laptops).<p>I assume that they have great deals with laptop manufacturers. You can&#x27;t find a Dell XPS with a Ryzen, for example. Ultrabooks are mainly Intel-based. The Framework laptop is not available everywhere yet.<p>It&#x27;s the same frustration I had many years ago when I had to choose between a diesel car in stock and waiting 8 months or more for a gas one.\n\n  I got a nice Thinkpad T14 Gen 4 recently with a 7840U, if you like Lenovo Thinkpads. I&#x27;ve used many Intel ones before and I like them all equally.\n\n    Thanks for the recommendation. Thinkpads are excellent, and honestly, I wanted one. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not too fond of the company.<p>This is because they&#x27;ve done shady security and privacy-related stuff in the past, for example, shipping laptops with malware in 2015 or selling US Marines&#x27; laptops with altered hardware to send data back to China [1].<p>To make it worse, they also have weird practices regarding buying used products: they recommend you avoid buying used laptops (saying they might have viruses but later removed the page [2]) or saying that once you unlock your phone, you are not allowed to sell it [3].<p>TL;DR: Lovely machine, but I can&#x27;t trust the company behind them.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lenovo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lenovo</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ahw1cppZi-g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ahw1cppZi-g</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U2k9D81fbpA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U2k9D81fbpA</a>\n\n      Fair enough. I have blind spots for sketchy things done by companies that make products I like.\n\nIf we don&#x27;t count the CPU people use the most, in their pocket computers, AKA smartphones, Intel leads by a wide margin. Otherwise, they are in 4th place.\n\nI recall watching Dave House, Intel VP, present the i486 at a CHIPS(?) conference in San Jose(?) in about 1988. He stood up, looked at his watch and said will folks it&#x27;s about 11am and Intel has made more i486 this morning than all the RISC chips vendors (MIPS, SPARC, POWER, etc) have ever shipped.<p>Or was it the ill-fated i860?<p>Anyway the point is that all you have to do is not manage Intel like a penny pinching accountant and it will remain #1 just because it has more money to plough back into (process) R&amp;D.<p>Sadly (for Intel) this is what they did for a couple of decades and only Joe Biden can save their bacon."

We skip the transcription step.<p>Latency: OpenAI&#x27;s implementation is quite slow - 5+ seconds to get a reply - but even optimized solutions are far slower than this approach. Fundamentally, most transcription models do audio -&gt; audio encoder -&gt; text decoder. By skipping the text decoder, we are always going to win on speed, we just do less work.<p>Emotion: transcription cannot transcribe emotion, only the text, but emotion - eg if the user is sarcastic, angry, happy, etc - plays a big role.<p>Transcription errors: in a cascaded approach, any mistake in an earlier step propagates to the latter steps. Mistranscription means that the LLM will make a mistake.

It&#x27;s written in a speech-like roundabout style (e.g. &quot;it is crucial that&quot;), and there&#x27;s a typo right in the middle on an important word (than --&gt; that). LLM can work around typos in most cases, but here it is vaguely possibly imo that this is what is causing it to continue citing wikipedia in responses.<p>&quot;At times, the tool was too eager to please, so I asked it to tone it down a little: “You can skip the chit chat and pleasantries.”&quot;<p>I have found in my experience playing with ChatGPT that this is just the completely wrong mental model to have of the tool in order to get what you want out of it.

The author and many others are using the LLM in exactly the way that they&#x27;re told it should be used. You don&#x27;t learn that this is wrong unless you&#x27;re an LLM nerd.\n\n    I don’t think that’s true. I think a lot of these articles actually create these results intentionally so that they have the conclusion they want to write about: that AI isn’t ready.<p>I have been watching Devin and really see the model they have implemented working well for these kinds of executive function step-by-step LLM tasks. It’s remarkably smart how they implemented it.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-decoder.com&#x2F;cognition-unveils-ai-powered-software-developer-devin-for-better-programming&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-decoder.com&#x2F;cognition-unveils-ai-powered-softwar...</a><p>If you give vague instructions to a junior level human you get poor work product just like AI. But every journalist wants to write that ringer-dinger traffic bringer about <i>ai not being ready for prime time</i> or whatever bad headline works…\n\n      You seem to be assuming malice or bad faith here, but I haven&#x27;t seen any reason to suspect that. Not to say that you&#x27;re wrong, of course. You might be right. I just don&#x27;t see why I should suspect it.<p>Particularly considering that I know multiple people who have made a similar error. The distortion that the extreme hype is generating is pretty widespread.\n\n        Perhaps. But I generally would expect some level of research and professionalism beyond such simplistic concepts from someone who has a degree in journalism and works in the field.<p>Hype is precisely what journalists are supposed to cut through. That’s why it’s called ‘reporting.’ So the idea that because many people with no background in AI are confused conflating to reasons why that’s acceptable for journalists writing about it seems rather weak to me.<p>I do see a broad series of articles that follow the pattern, and do believe it to be clickbait ‘journalism’ of the lowest standard.<p>Incompetence could be an explanation, but it’s article after article from professional mainstream sources: sources that should know better or at least have a consult with someone who does as part of their due diligence. That implies it’s being done because it gets views, not because it’s good journalism and is therefore intentional. But that is my conjecture you are right.\n\n          Well, the press has always been truly awful at reporting on technical topics. It&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t, and never could, take any reporting on such things at face value at all, is why all of the scientists and researchers I&#x27;ve worked with have disliked it when their work gets reported on, and is why the so much of what regular people think &quot;scientists say&quot; is incorrect. Nuance and therefore accuracy gets dropped in favor of having a clear, simple story.<p>I don&#x27;t see why LLM-related topics would be any different. But the reasons why this happens are pretty clear, and poor intentions or even laziness on the part of the reporters are rarely factors.\n\n  &gt; The problem is that people like this author are trying to literally treat it like a person instead of an LLM.<p>This is exactly how consumer-facing LLM-powered interfaces are marketed and promoted, though.\n\n  In other words, in order to get the &quot;massive productivity boost&quot; often cited as the main selling point of LLMs, you need to have completed a thorough training on prompt engineering, and if you get something slightly wrong (e.g. a simple typo), you get absolutely zero feedback that your intent was misunderstood?\n\n    Yeah these people keep telling me about how cars are a &quot;massive productivity boost&quot; and i get in and nothing happens.\n\n      Also I refused to learn basic traffic rules and now I keep ending up in accidents.

Right in the chat interface for chat-gpt is says, “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.”<p>I’m sure accuracy will improve but it’s not a strong point for the current generation <i>nor was it ever intended to be</i>.<p>Not coming at you, just trying to support your point.<p>In my mind the fact that publishing houses are being co-opted (and I’ve seen it too) with this generation of LLM is more social commentary about the sad state of modern news and publishing. Imagine what happens when the LLM technology hits initial degrees or human equivalence.\n\n    &gt; LLMs are designed to create “helpful” and “convincing responses” without any overriding guarantees regarding their accuracy or alignment with fact.<p>This is an incoherent goal: accuracy and alignment with fact are a big part of being convincing and a bigger part of being helpful.\n\n      Being accurate and being helpful are different things. Otherwise there wouldn’t be liars.\n\n        Being accurate is generally key to be helpful.<p>That&#x27;s the reason liars, while they certainly exist, are, all others things being equal, viewed as less helpful than non-liars.\n\n    The way I think of it is, LLMs are sold as HAL but really they&#x27;re a better MegaHAL: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kranzky&#x2F;megahal\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kranzky&#x2F;megahal</a><p>For that reason I don&#x27;t think LLM, alone, will be capable of human-equivalent intelligence.\n\n  It probably is but one nuance is that peer reviews are from random people across the internet, not subject experts.<p>There’s an argument to be made whether random people can achieve the same thing that experts do.<p>I personally use Wikipedia as an authoritative source but I do check sources of something doesn’t make sense to me.\n\nThat’s consistent with my experience too.<p>Huge help for hobby programming but struggling to use it for day job (finance). Even for basic memos the reasoning just isn’t coherent enough and not nuanced enough.<p>I think it’s because programming is quite modular. You can ask it a fragment of a problem easily. Eg how do I send a message on GCP pubsub. That same modular and self contained aspect just doesn’t exist in my day job\n\n  Just a tangential note, it is useful for programming in the sense you can use it as a faster google to lookup a snippet.  By the same token, asking &quot;what&#x27;s the kelly criterion&quot; is faster than googling (for a finance example).<p>But most programmers (other than sheer juniors) also don&#x27;t spend most of their day doing &quot;insert snippet here&quot;.  ChatGPT isn&#x27;t close to figuring out the proper solution to link up multiple disparate APIs, read through the docs to figure out why the system was written a particular way, spend hours chatting with various people, wade through the political mire, understand vague customer and business requirements, and then finally submit a PR that forms the first in a long series of fraught attempts to cobble together such a system.<p>Upon PR review, deliver correctly worded responses depending on the personalities of the people who are ripping your code to shreds for pedantic and often meaningless reasons (mostly to seem important), and notice when the feedback is actually legitimate and requirees changes, or signals a bigger issue with the entire project.<p>Do that in a loop, keeping the context of the progress over the last few months&#x2F;years so that a steady stream of design documents, political agreements, assignments, knowledge transfer as employees change over, and system requirements evolve, and changes come together to form a project that adjusts subtly over time as the politics and business requirements change as well.<p>In the end, everyone&#x27;s &quot;day job&quot; is full of nuance and subtlety, but GPT is really good for automating everyone else&#x27;s jobs (like those lawyers, its just a bunch of text rules, right?  Or doctors, its just looking up a matching list of symptoms I think...)\n\n    &gt;everyone&#x27;s &quot;day job&quot; is full of nuance and subtlety, but GPT is really good for automating everyone else&#x27;s jobs<p>That&#x27;s not really where I was going with that, but can see how it may come across as such.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t that one job has nuance &amp; high level skills while the other doesn&#x27;t but rather that ChatGPT has different usefulness at the low end of each.<p>Or put differently for coding ChatGPT use generating boilerplate is the obvious win at the low end. I haven&#x27;t found the equivalent low hanging fruit in my day to day despite enthusiastic trying.<p>&gt;google to lookup a snippet. By the same token, asking &quot;what&#x27;s the kelly criterion&quot;<p>Think a step slightly more complicated than wikipedia like info retrieval. For coding it can do a fair bit more thanks to vast amounts of github code...for other jobs there is no equivalent depth of knowledge baked into the models. Maybe a couple of medical journals, some transcripts of law cases? It&#x27;s just nowhere near though in scale, code or applicability and that shows. Nor are the other jobs as inherently machine readable (or modular as I said - code is usually split nicely into functional procedures etc)\n\n      Just to echo this, I can see if you are a program manager or something &quot;programming adjacent&quot; you also would have little to no use for ChatGPT (despite being in an area its mostly very good at). It removes all the &quot;write me a snippet&quot; low hanging fruit out of the job.  E.g. if you are the one running the team of engineers, there&#x27;s nothing like that, its all just the nuance &#x2F; politics and human decision making that requires the full context (not something you can jot down easily for GPT).  For finance, probably anyone doing math &#x2F; quant &#x2F; research could still have low hanging fruit (solve this integral, what&#x27;s the formula, how do I do this in excel), but anyone who is mostly decision making can&#x27;t get much value from GPT.\n\nAt that point in 2023 didn&#x27;t chatGPT have a hard knowledge cutoff? If so asking it to cite relevant sources to a major news event that just happened seems kind of ridiculous. I think it was much later in 2023 that that was removed.\n\n  Even then this displays a remarkable lack of understanding on what llms are and how they work. They have a fuzzy memory of things, so when you ask for citations you&#x27;ll get titles, names and journals that seem plausible because they&#x27;re centred around the distribution of names you&#x27;d expect for a paper of the kind that was required to support a specific point but llms don&#x27;t have the capacity to resolve information to that degree, otherwise we&#x27;d have losslesscompression of all public works in a few gb of data. That would be as if not more ground breaking than llms chat capacity.\n\nChatGPT cannot be used for anything that requires precision. It is just  confidently wrong too many times.<p>Use it for what it is good for, easy fuzzy activities."

There&#x27;s almost no benefit to discussing these articles, because the points have already been made, hashed, and re-hashed hundreds of times. In other words, the value add of this article to me is 0.<p>Media&#x27;s been collapsing for a while now, because technology makes a lot of markets into winner-take-all markets, with a LOT of losers like local newspapers and below-average quality independent journalists.\n\n    Very few US media outlets are worth anything imo, basically WSJ, Bloomberg, and (very marginally) Politico. If you are lucky your local paper may be worthwhile for local matters but not for anything else.\n\n      Where do you get your news?\n\n  Really idiotic stance, with all due respect.\n\n    And I likewise respect your right to hold that opinion.<p>Unfortunately for the media, they wasted far too much of my time and good will to ever have my respect or sympathy ever again. If they are collapsing, that is a good thing and I want more.\n\n      &gt; Unfortunately for the media, they wasted far too much of my time and good will to ever have my respect or sympathy ever again.<p>How did they hurt you?\n\n        Had quite a few friends (and I still consider them friends even if they do not reciprocate anymore) driven off the deep end by the media&#x27;s constant rage sensationalism and fearmongering.<p>The media is concentrated, incendiary bullshit. They are cancers upon society and I have no pity they are dying. Good <i>fucking</i> riddance.\n\n      It&#x27;s good that the free press is collapsing? Zeig heil mein Hungarian freund\n\nCollapsing because of technological changes, and most journalists being clickbaiters and liars.<p>IMHO, it&#x27;s better we&#x27;re left with the few successful media houses (WSJ, Reuters, AP, Bloomberg, etc.) carrying the industry on its backs, the rest should be free to fizzle out in a free market...times have changed.\n\n  &gt; IMHO, it&#x27;s better we&#x27;re left with the few successful media houses (WSJ, Reuters, AP, Bloomberg, etc.) carrying the industry on its backs<p>Where do these fit in:<p>mainstream media outlets<p><pre><code>  ABC (Disney)\n\n  MSNBC &#x2F; NBC (Comcast)\n\n  FOX &#x2F; FOX News &#x2F; CBS news (Paramount)\n\n  CNN (Warner Bros. Discovery)</code></pre>\n\n    Cable news should be better classified under &quot;entertainment&quot;.\n\n      The previous millennium already called it “infotainment”.\n\n        Indeed. There&#x27;s less &quot;info&quot; now.\n\n&gt; public subsidies to smaller news outlets, and eventually industry transformation into a publicly funded system<p>Ah yes, state run media, Pravda and Isvestia! Always the same result, state-approved propaganda.\n\n  State-run media is very common in the Nordics (SVT, NRK, DR, etc.), not the same result.<p>Always the same result is your opinion, not reality.\n\n    Are you sure about that? Sometimes news can appear &quot;fair and balanced&quot; if it fits in with one&#x27;s own bias. Every news organization heatedly claims it is &quot;fair and balanced&quot;.\n\n      I&#x27;m pretty sure, you can check for yourself with Google Translate.\n\n        I wouldn&#x27;t know because I know nothing about Scandinavian politics.<p>Every news source is biased.<p>Do these newspapers ever significantly attack the politicians that control their funding?\n\n          Of course, every news source is biased, humans are biased and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s impossible to be absolutely objective in reporting the news. That doesn&#x27;t mean the bias is as detrimental as news sources in the US landscape.<p>One example of bias from SVT was the unwillingness to criticise immigration policies but not due to political reasons but probably more cultural ones (not appear racist, a bit of &quot;Swedish shame&quot; in that). Doesn&#x27;t mean it invalidates the whole organisation because of it.<p>&gt; Do these newspapers ever significantly attack the politicians that control their funding?<p>Yes, they do, reporting on government scandals is absolutely normal (i.e.: Karolinska University hospital corruption). Even though there&#x27;s a tendency for right-wing governments to try to rein in the reporting I wouldn&#x27;t say even then it&#x27;s influenced much. The BBC under the Tories is a clear example of that being eroding over time, which is a shame since the BBC used to be more trusted before the past 10-12 years.\n\n            Bias is also apparent in what is not reported.\n\n              And I mentioned an example explicitly by saying SVT was unwilling to report on immigration policies issues for a while, what&#x27;s your point? I did agree there is bias in any news media, but bias isn&#x27;t black-and-white in determining the reputation of a news&#x2F;media agency, there&#x27;s a point where it&#x27;s detrimental and there&#x27;s a natural point where it&#x27;s expected but does not affect the reporting as much to disregard the organisation as a whole.<p>There&#x27;s worlds of difference between what Fox News does and what SVT does, I&#x27;d much rather live in a society where SVT provides news to a large cohort of the population rather than Fox News.<p>You stating the obvious is not moving this discussion forward... Your bias against state-owned enterprises is clear, not only from this chain of comments, still in this case it&#x27;s unfounded and just your ideology.\n\n                &gt; Your bias against state-owned enterprises is clear<p>This is an incomplete statement. The biases of any media company are clear. The bias of a state-funded media company are in favor of those in power that control the funding. The biases of a free market media company are those that finance the company.<p>The difference is that with the free market, you have multiple biases to select from, and it is not backed by the power of the government.<p>&gt; till in this case it&#x27;s unfounded and just your ideology.<p>I know how human nature works. Consider the Don Lemon vs Elon Musk interview. Musk was going to finance Lemon big time. To kick it off, he was going to let Lemon interview him. Lemon proceeded to do his best to insult Musk and try to get Musk to say something embarrassing. Afterwards, Musk decided he was not going to finance Lemon.<p>Whoever pays the piper calls the tune.<p>It&#x27;s a fantasy that having government funded media means independent journalism.\n\nI remember when NPR was outraged at the suggestion that government funding influenced their slant on the news, as they weren&#x27;t dependent on the government funding they received. So just stop accepting the funding!\n\n  In NPRs defense, I haven&#x27;t seen them change much from administration to administration.\n\n    They were captured by one party a long time ago.\n\n      They&#x27;re captured by capital, as are both corporate parties\n\nI mean, who didn&#x27;t see this coming when companies like Clear Channel started buying and homogenizing everything they could get their grubby hands on?\n\nToo much consolidation in media. Local and alternative voices fade. (IMO)<p>The solution to monopolies is not to rubber-stamp them into existence. HN folks can probably rattle off hundreds of great ideas and innovations from small companies that were bought -- ideas and innovations which just disappeared or were turned into milquetoast.<p>The internet brings both rather universal self-publishing and the network effect.\n\n&gt;Mass layoffs are tearing through US media. To preserve a functioning media ecosystem, we need three things: immediate aid to struggling journalists, public subsidies to smaller news outlets, and eventually industry transformation into a publicly funded system.<p>Could she work harder to undermine her own point with this whiny intro\n\n&gt;Mass layoffs are tearing through US media.<p>I dont agree with the assumed premise. Article provides some examples but at best it&#x27;s irrelevant lay offs. Failing media outlets are always going to exist.<p>&gt;To preserve a functioning media ecosystem, we need three things: immediate aid to struggling journalists<p>You can look to us in Canada. The government gives the media money, the political interference continued to ramp up until a crisis.<p>The government has absolutely no business funding the media.\n\n&gt; Mass layoffs are tearing through US media. To preserve a functioning media ecosystem, we need three things: immediate aid to struggling journalists, public subsidies to smaller news outlets, and eventually industry transformation into a publicly funded system.<p>People don&#x27;t seem to want what we&#x27;re selling. So the government should tax them, then give us the money to continue providing what they&#x27;ve demonstrated they don&#x27;t want. Did I get that right?\n\n  In Canada we’re trying that and now we have major media dependant on a government paycheque and specifically depending on a certain political party because the other wants to get rid of it. Now you should evaluate our freedom of press and potential bias.\n\n    If you think your media is biased, you should see the kind of bias that comes from media funded only by unregulated capital markets.\n\nPeople will only outlay their limited cash on things that seem to &#x27;have value&#x27;.<p>Do the products of the modern media companies have any &#x27;value&#x27;?<p>IIRC there was a US president whose name I have forgotten who often complained about media companies producing very little but &#x27;Fake News&#x27;. Fake News has no &#x27;value&#x27; at all. Those companies deserve to die."

If you don&#x27;t understand why, you should research it.\n\n  Removing the inconsistency across different operating systems, I guess?\n\n    There can even be inconsistencies after glibc upgrades.\n\n      Yes, you can run into that kind of stuff when configuring stuff like accent insensitive search. Most people just wrap the unstable function in a &#x27;stable&#x27; wrapper which means you will have to reindex after an incompatible glibc update.\n\n  I&#x27;ve read the linked article and the proposal, and this seems exciting but I&#x27;m interested to know more about the real world impact i.e. what kinds of perf gains might be seen in real world use cases. If you&#x27;re deeply versed in this maybe you could shine a light on it for the rest of us...\n\n    I have not tried to measure the performance impact, although I have no doubt that it exists and is significant. Basically it boils down to the difference in performance of doing memcmp() versus strcoll() for every comparison needed to sort your strings.<p>The bigger deal in my view is that it provides at least an option for a Postgres project controlled, built-in, immutable collation. Unlike glibc or ICU which are historically the only options (mostly glibc), and both of which are known to change their collation ordering from time to time completely outside control of the Postgres developers. If you want a deeper dive on why this is an issue, please watch the presentation I gave at pgcon last year found linked here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgcon.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;pgcon_2023&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;session&#x2F;345-sorting-out-glibc-collation-challenges&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgcon.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;pgcon_2023&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;session&#x2F;345...</a>\n\n      Thanks very much!

I&#x27;ve been working with databases for ages but hadn&#x27;t really thought much about collation other than times (mostly with MySQL) when collation didn&#x27;t work as expected.

However, it only produces a very small amount of this toxin, and it also prevents the growth of other undesirable molds.&quot;<p>&quot;Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is a mycotoxin and fungal neurotoxin produced by the molds Aspergillus and Penicillium. It is a heavily substituted tetramic acid that can contaminate food sources, animal feeds, and agricultural commodities.&quot;\n\n  Those do not appear to be quotations from the article. Have I missed something, and if not why are you posting them here?<p>(E.g., is there some implicit argument along the lines of &quot;Brie and Camembert are dangerous, so it will be a good thing if they stop being produced&quot;?)\n\n    Sorry, unlinkable (due to AI) Google searches.\n\n      What is their relevance to this article, beyond the fact that they mention P. camemberti?\n\n        That it&#x27;s not really a big loss, I guess.\n\n          That seems like a bit of a leap. I mean, the quantities are very small and so far as I know no one has seriously claimed that eating Brie or Camembert is bad for you (or at any rate that it&#x27;s any worse than eating any other cheese).<p>Lots of foods are at least slightly bad for you -- some of them much worse than Brie or Camembert -- but I would still consider it unfortunate if (say) chocolate or bacon or cream became unavailable.\n\n            Chocolate is a superfood, and bacon is not toxic. There&#x27;s a difference between a food containing a known toxin and a healthy food that can become unhealthy based on its preparation. Boiled beef is healthy, but charred beef causes pancreatic cancer. However, blue cheese contains a neurotoxin, and I doubt it has a hormetic effect as I haven&#x27;t seen a study showing that people eating blue cheese have better health.\n\n              (Apologies for the very slow response; I forgot that this discussion was ongoing.)<p>&quot;The dose makes the poison&quot; and even without hormesis it can be the case that very small doses of something do you no actual harm because whatever they do is within the range your body can fix quickly.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen a study showing that people eating blue cheese (or Brie and Camembert) have <i>worse</i> health; have you?<p>Chocolate may be &quot;a superfood&quot; but most chocolate also contains quite a lot of sugar, which is (tasty but) very bad for you. I am pretty sure most people who eat substantial amounts of chocolate would be healthier rather than less healthy if they ate less.<p>Most bacon is cured using nitrates and nitrites, which on cooking produce (slightly) harmful compounds. All red meat seems to be at least a little bit bad for you, too.<p>To repeat, I&#x27;m not saying that we shouldn&#x27;t eat chocolate and bacon. I eat plenty of them myself. But when we do we&#x27;re making a tradeoff between present tastiness and future health, and if the same&#x27;s true for Brie and Camembert then that doesn&#x27;t seem fundamentally different. And I would be sad if any of those things became unavailable.\n\nAnother instance where HN auto-anti-clickbait makes nonsense of the title. (But also another where arguably the right solution is to change the title further, rather than undoing what the auto-anti-clickbait machine did.)<p>The original title has an exclamation mark after &quot;Bleu&quot;. The modified title makes it look as if the first two words are the name of a type of cheese. I think the best thing would be just to remove the first two words (especially as I&#x27;m pretty sure the usual form of the minced oath is &quot;Sacrebleu&quot; or &quot;Sacre bleu&quot;, without that acute accent)."

All the money went to lawyers, consultants, and the usual grifters. Hardly anything was actually spend on construction and they started with the most useless leg of the rail.

California only has numbers for 2022 and not 2023 but 49% natural gas is not going to cut it. I would say they should build nuclear but that&#x27;s not sufficient for some people.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.ca.gov&#x2F;data-reports&#x2F;energy-almanac&#x2F;california-electricity-data&#x2F;2022-total-system-electric-generation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.ca.gov&#x2F;data-reports&#x2F;energy-almanac&#x2F;califo...</a>\n\n  Even if approved today, it&#x27;ll probably take a decade or more to build a nuclear power plant in CA.\n\n    Better get approving then.\n\n    Or anywhere else, for that matter. Even in China, which has the most recent experience, you&#x27;re talking close on ten years, realistically.\n\nIs California one of the more progressive states with regards to reductions?<p>This does not bode well for the world we share.\n\n  Depend on how you define &quot;progressive&quot;. But it does say something about how the world function.<p>Imo, CA is more interested in appearing to be progressive than actually being progressive, i.e. making laws that treat the symptoms instead of the root cause and as a result ended up making things worse. Prop 13, &quot;anti-discrimination&quot; laws, tough laws against gas cars, etc. Those backfired and instead of repealing and fixing them, they moved on to making more laws to add on an already gigantic clusterfuck.<p>It is hard to make real progress. It is so much easier to mess up and never admit to it.\n\n  If California’s goal was to actually reduce carbon emissions, then it would increase taxes on fossil fuels every year until the target emissions were met.<p>And before someone chimes in on that hurting poor people, California could use those taxes to redistribute cash to poorer people.<p>But the goal is not to actually reduce emissions, it is to say they are trying to while not really reducing quality of life (i.e. making sacrifices, especially amongst the richer half).  And in the process, create tons of avenues for corruption and bureaucracy to suck productivity out of society.<p>We want to pretend like we do stuff for the environment or future generations, but we still want that detached single family 2.5k sq ft house, and the SUVs, and the tropical vacations.  And, of course, it is going to be a hard sell to get a small portion of the world’s population to do that if everyone else is not.\n\n    <i>but we still want that detached single family 2.5k sq ft house, and the SUVs, and the tropical vacations. And, of course, it is going to be a hard sell to get a small portion of the world’s population to do that if everyone else is not.</i><p>Most of that would be fine if it were built and operated by nuclear and renewables though.\n\n      I have been hearing that for at least 20 years.  There is a reason fossil fuels reign supreme, their cost to convenience ratio cannot be beat (including regulatory challenges).\n\n&gt; triple rate of reductions<p>That’s such a confusing way to say it\n\nIn other news, the CA Legislature wrote a bill in 2022 that would allow all the private utilities to essentially destroy the rooftop solar industry by gouging the consumer directly and essentially make your electric bill an income tax [1].  The way it&#x27;s worded, none of the exported energy from a solar install will offset any of the connection costs (only the lowered rates).<p>Meanwhile, PG&amp;E gets to keep paying its investors before its victims. \nCalifornia can&#x27;t get past its corruption, and people wonder why we can&#x27;t meet our climate goals.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;solar&#x2F;comments&#x2F;12hobyp&#x2F;california_ab205_incomebased_flat_electricity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;solar&#x2F;comments&#x2F;12hobyp&#x2F;california_a...</a>\n\n  All net emission schemes in California for solar are essentially subsidized from non solar customers (generally a poorer, more consumption conscious population) to solar customers. NEM2 was outrageously bad but nem3 is still a subsidy.<p>Removing those schemes will make people install batteries instead, which will have a bigger impact on co2 reductions\n\n    Why is it that other states have true 1:1 net metering while NEM3 is essentially less than 1:3?<p>The real problem is that our grid is criminal underdeveloped.  I get they need connection fees (as opposed to the $0 we pay now) but $128&#x2F;mo for a connection charge for a high income earner (read: entry level dev) is pure theft compared to the average for other states with connection fees ($11&#x2F;mo).<p>California should nationalize PG&amp;E, wipe out its investor payback schemes and start running things properly."

Loved the way you coded it in pure JS.\n\nI&#x27;ve always loved these types of puzzles, glad to know what they&#x27;re called <i>and</i> have a place to find them!<p>Very well-designed site, definitely will be returning often\n\n  Thank you so much!\n\nI wish it was possible to manually check the clues since I&#x27;m writing them down on paper.\n\n  Right now the alternative is to disable the JS for this website, and the HTML-only version has checkboxes that you can check on&#x2F;off. Thanks for the feedback!\n\n    It&#x27;s very nice. I couldn&#x27;t finish the hardest difficulty: I must be missing something.<p>I&#x27;ve found some issues:\n- when refreshing, all progress is lost, including previously solved puzzles. I guess that you could store the current state of the daily puzzles in a cookie or on the drive.\n-<p>And I&#x27;ve some suggestions:\n- maybe add a grid like this one[0] in a tool or something to help us solve the hardest puzzles. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant, but i feel it is. I didn&#x27;t need to use this kind of grid until the hardest puzzle, but again, I couldn&#x27;t finish it, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s useful.\n- make the coloring of the grid optional: they&#x27;re distracting when solving the puzzle, I think<p>Anyways, very nice!

You&#x27;re the second person that recommends me to look at murdle today, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get some nice ideas from them.<p>About saving the state locally, should be trivial to do since I&#x27;m using React, nice suggestion.<p>The hardest level usually is tricky, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll solve tomorrow&#x27;s puzzle.\n\n  <p><pre><code>  document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;.clues span.icon&#x27;).forEach( el =&gt; { let p = el.parentNode; let ck = document.createElement(&#x27;input&#x27;); ck.setAttribute(&#x27;type&#x27;, &#x27;checkbox&#x27;); p.removeChild(el); p.appendChild(ck); })\n</code></pre>\nand I have absolutely no idea why anyone would fake checkboxes in a webpage, anyway\n\n    They&#x27;re not exactly checkboxes in the game, as they have three states (blank, checkmark and cross), that are automatically updated given the current game state.\n\nYou can do woodworking in the woods, just saying. :-)\n(I can not do difficulty 4 without paper, it&#x27;s a good difficulty)\n\n  Thanks for the feedback!\n\nThis is not the UX I&#x27;m used to for these puzzles - the more common experience is a full grid of all possible relationships between clues. The drop-downs feel stifling because you can&#x27;t cross off an option that you know is <i>not</i> in that position, nor do you get the visual cross-referencing across categories. It throws the whole thing off to me so I didn&#x27;t even finish the first puzzle.\n\n  Thanks for the feedback! Indeed the usual way to play logic problems is using a grid, and they&#x27;re usually called logic grid puzzles. Zebra Puzzles are somewhat simpler and the interface is purposely different. It should feel like a &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; where the pieces are the constrains and they only fit specific places.<p>I plan to launch a logic grid puzzles website with a proper grid as well. Thanks again for the honest feedback.\n\nSlig, I don&#x27;t know how to reach you other than here.<p>Today&#x27;s hardest puzzle (#110 @ 2024-03-23) says that &quot;Theodore&#x27;s favorite player is Italian&quot;.<p>The list comprises of the following players: Di Stefano (Argentina then Spain), Maradona (Argentina), Ronaldinho (Brazil), Ronaldo (Brazil or Portugal, depends on who the game speaks about), Rooney (England).<p>That&#x27;s roughly what I don&#x27;t like with your implementation: the grids cannot be solved by themselves. Some external knowledge is required, and in this case, the knowledge is incorrect. Basically, the hint here should say: &quot;Theodore&#x27;s favorite player is &lt;whoever the AI thinks is Italian&gt;&quot;.\n\n  Hi again Oliver! Just got your email and I&#x27;ll reply there you tomorrow as well. Thanks for the feedback.<p>&gt;The grids cannot be solved by themselves. Some external knowledge is required<p>I introduced this kind of feature in another custom made puzzles, such as one about blood types (&quot;the universal donor is ...&quot;) and I got a lot of praise for it and I thought it could be extended to another themes. But I can see that it might be too broad and uninteresting. Will revise this.\n\nHi Slig, just wanted to say that my family has been obsessing over these puzzles since you posted these. Thanks for the putting this together.<p>I would suggest you add some sort of share button, for bragging and viral spreading. And maybe some sort of local state for tracking streaks.\n\n  Wow, that&#x27;s so nice to hear! Thank you so much!<p>I&#x27;m going to implement some sort of tracking streaks as soon as possible.<p>Since you have many data points, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the level difficulty and on the clues that require external knowledge (such as &quot;the universal donor is sitting at...&quot;).

Also, see &quot;The Better Angels of our Nature&quot;\n\n    If you take the bible on face value, you can easily see that every single one of us has incest in our family history.\n\n  Do you have any evidence for that?

This person hated religion. I&#x27;m not religious. He blamed religion for all the atrocities in the world. I wasn&#x27;t defending religion but I like to look at both sides and said...<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because of religion that we haven&#x27;t already destroyed ourselves. At least with Christian (New Testament) religion (the only one I&#x27;m passably familiar with), there are a set of (divine) rules to live by[0]:<p>No killing, no adultery, stop stealing, stop lying, no false testimony, stop envying&#x2F;coveting what is not yours... etc.<p>** Please, I don&#x27;t want to get into a religious argument. **<p>But, what if... religion was _invented_ by man because man himself was so murdery and rapey as OP (afpx) stated. That the only way to control him&#x2F;her was by inventing a power greater than man himself. Indoctrinate man at some core level so that these tendencies could be managed somehow.<p>Because even with an all-seeing God, even with a divine set of rules, even with the promise of an after-life... believers broke those &quot;divine&quot; rules (as they do today) - often in the name of religion itself.<p>All of this is supposition for discussion (not argument), please:-)<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ten_Commandments?useskin=vector\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ten_Commandments?useskin=vecto...</a>\n\n      This isn&#x27;t an uncommon thought in the slightest. I hear this used as an argument frequently. Maybe some of you need a booklet with things that you can and cannot do but many of us do not and it isn&#x27;t because  of a religion.\n\n  Not all, but much of western society, definitely :)\n\n  &gt; Natural selection doesn&#x27;t care about morality.<p>Natural selection doesn&#x27;t care about morality, but it does care about incest, since products of incest—especially after a few generations—tend to be markedly less fit.\n\n    That&#x27;s not actually true\n\n      It&#x27;s not?  In what way?\n\nAlso infidelity.

And all of those printed tokens were immediately used to buy BTC and other volatile tokens. No wonder the the price went insane over past months.\n\nWhat I cannot understand is how the crypto market is supposed to be looked at in the context of central bank policy. Stocks are businesses, businesses can be understood in the framing of the economy, and inference can be had as it pertains to stocks (and collections of stocks) regarding that particular business and particular central bank levers. BTC and the like do no have these connections, so why does crypto even care? How should I be thinking about this?\n\n  There are narratives like lower interest rates -&gt; more money circulating -&gt; more speculation -&gt; crypto goes up. Or higher interest rates -&gt; crypto goes up as a hedge against inflation. This still leaves you the problem of deciding what model to use.\n\n  It’s about liquidity in the financial markets- lower interest rates means people earn less when the money is in a back.

The short impact, depending on an industry, is that the Russian government will have slightly less money. This is net good short term because this money finances the war among others (but also education, hospitals...).

No one cares. No one bats an eye. Pages don&#x27;t follow web semantics (ctrl&#x2F;middle click to open in a new tab? no we&#x27;ll do some javascript instead). Plus a bunch of other stuff no one bothers with.<p>It&#x27;s a huge mess. You _can_ make beautiful, simple, elegant and useful things with web tech, but the number of people who care enough to do so are so so few.<p>Making good stuff doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.\n\n  If devin ai is as good as the tech demo. The demographic of bottom of the barrel devs and middle managers will disappear almost instantly.<p>I have worked on those projects as well. At that point, it’s collect a paycheck and log off.\n\n    I really doubt AI will *improve* the quality of code out there. It just makes it easier to churn out barely functional copy&#x2F;pasted code where the &quot;prompt engineer&quot; has no reason to understand any of the underlying code. Good performant software requires domain knowledge and experience to architect things correctly to solve the problem at hand.\n\n      AI wont help product direction or design. You&#x27;ll have a bunch of rotten, enshittifying, terribly (ux, ui) designed software even faster, all in the hands of the business decision makers.\n\n  Page load times have a meaningful impact on sales.<p>&gt; The survey from Digital.com asked 1,250 online shoppers how long they typically wait for web pages to load before abandoning a website and their intended purchases.<p>&gt; Fifty-three percent expect the page to load in three seconds or less, and 21% say slow-loading pages are their biggest gripe when shopping online. Half will simply abandon their shopping carts if pages don’t load fast enough, the report said.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;report-shows-consumers-wont-wait-long-for-web-pages-to-load&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;report-shows-consumer...</a>\n\n    When your customers are enterprise, page load times dont mean anything. Some 500k&#x2F;yr VP gets a demo, signs off, and $20&#x2F;hr users are told to use the system.<p>If page load times mattered, then i wouldn&#x27;t have written what I did above\n\n  That is a huge wake up call.

I rarely have to buy anything unless it&#x27;s pretty rare, although I do still buy things like resistors, because the cost&#x2F;benefit ratio of scavenging really low-value parts doesn&#x27;t work for me.\n\nWe need more places like Portland, OR&#x27;s Free Geek — it&#x27;s a small warehouse full of surplus computer parts, you can drop off anything or walk out with everything necessary to build a whole PC desktop. The last time I was out there, they were bringing in whole palettes of old laptops and turning them into Chromebooks. Awesome stuff.<p>I&#x27;m currently sitting on a growing pile of brand new surplus cables, can&#x27;t find anywhere similar in NYC that will take them. When I ask, folks say &quot;just take them to some electronics recycling place.&quot; Recycling, as far as I can tell, at best means &quot;shredding for excess gold and traces of lithium.&quot; I wanna see this stuff get used!\n\n  I bet that there are many thousands of people in NYC that feel as you do. You might consider starting a hobbyist swap meet kind of thing.<p>It might even be possible to cover any operating costs by selling used cables. In my area, there&#x27;s an electronic recycling business that doesn&#x27;t just shred everything -- they repair and refurbish as much as they can and sell it in their store. That&#x27;s where I buy all my cables, because they have any cable you&#x27;d want for 1&#x2F;10th the price. I was talking to the people working there, and they said that the cable sales alone account for nearly half of their revenue.\n\nturns out this &quot;right to repair&quot; thing I&#x27;ve heard rumors about may be onto something :-&#x2F;\n\nI think the consumer electronics industry will need to be heavily regulated to move away from consumable electronics before we see any meaningful change.<p>Electronics will need to be open so both the hardware and software can be repaired and maintained by others than the vender.\n\nLooking at those photos, I can&#x27;t help to wonder what % (say, by weight) of circuitboards, parts, cables etc are actually re-used at <i>any</i> point.<p>With remainder most likely winding up in a landfill, open-air fire pit, or low-tech metal recycling operation (like shred whole boards &amp; mechanically sort the bits). In all cases, harmful to environment &amp; people&#x27;s health.<p>Shipping e-waste to countries like Ghana is not <i>the</i> problem here. But recipient should obey same environmental standards as country where it came from. Can&#x27;t guarantee that? (proper machinery no-existant, corruption, no oversight etc).

      "conversation_text": "I&#x27;m surprised this is reaching mainstream news now. It was known for a long time, before  Vowles joined Williams, that it was in the shit, underfunded  and that they were using Excel files sent via email attachments, instead of a proper ERP system.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising this happens actually, when as a F1 team principal, your goal and job security is tied to scoring points at this year&#x27;s season, not setting up a multi-year plan to update your IT infrastructure and processes, because if you don&#x27;t score enough points, you might not be around next year to see your grand plan bear fruit. And if you&#x27;re like Williams, failing, underfunded and replace your TP every year, who&#x27;s only there as a scapegoat, no wonder nothing ever improves.<p>It basically the trap of perverse incentives and very low job security. F1 shareholders won&#x27;t care that you replaced Excel with an efficient ERP system, If you don&#x27;t score any points on the track, you&#x27;re out.<p>Anyway, they&#x27;re not alone. People would be surprised how many well respected and profitable companies still run like this.<p>But F1 is special here. Adrian Newey, the genius race car designer and head of aerodynamics at Red Bull only uses a drafting board for design, never CAD, or any computers actually, to the point his secretary prints his emails and CAE simulations for him on paper[1] and works on those, to the point he is surrounded by mountains of paper. The tech community would be livid to see this.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;PNuQMmnTpoo?si=58yMTzNB9a815FoM&amp;t=115\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;PNuQMmnTpoo?si=58yMTzNB9a815FoM&amp;t=115</a>\n\n  &gt; and that they were using Excel files sent via email attachments<p>That hurt to read. Not even the whole &quot;cloud collaboration-enabled&quot; Google Sheets&#x2F;Microsoft365 excel?\n\n  The difference with Adrian Newey is that whatever he’s doing works, and the rest of the org is using all the high tech aerodynamic modeling. Red Bull is so far ahead (largely due to Aero) that it’s boring to watch.<p>But it’s not like the excel sheets are giving Williams an edge.\n\n  My understanding is that they were tracking significantly fewer parts in Excel as many of what they are now tracking as separate parts were previously tracked as a single part (kind of an assembly). I think they were previously tracking somewhere in the 100-200 parts in Excel.<p>My understanding for why this is coming out now is that there was a talk Vowles has done recently where he mentioned the massive hit getting ready for this season because they changed both Excel into the new ERP systems AND started tracking each individual part, which complicated the transition and why it was such a rush for Williams to be ready for this year.\n\nCan’t wait to see their reaction when they realize just how much of society and commerce is also managed by giant Excel sheets.\n\n  The worst I saw was a network hardware and service provider maintaining all their products and services in Excel spreadsheets per contract. Each of those had all the relevant information, the list of products, when they were due for renewal, service, or replacement, and the agreed-upon rates.<p>I was there to get them off that system doing ETL to Oracle, which was only the first part of getting it to SAP. It was interesting to see all the diverse and creative ways that the structure and formatting of these contract spreadsheets diverged. The worst was encoding crucial information in colors or other styles of the cells. That required automation from both outside and inside the spreadsheet, as well as develop a full library of heuristics to determine which strategy to use to visually parse the sheets. Looking back, I don&#x27;t even know how this wasn&#x27;t a multi-year project and it got done (at least the pre-SAP parts) on-time. Even then, half the work was still on the Oracle side once the data was there but barely normalized <i>(what&#x27;s less than 0NF?)</i>.\n\n    Oracle?<p>From frying pan to fire.\n\n  And or access databases.<p>+7 years ago, heard JPM had +20k of those on their networks. I just shiver thinking about that.\n\n  There are still opportunities for us SWEs even with the advent of chatGPT. Heck, lots of businesses are just an IG page + Google Sheets.\n\n    Then again, why would those businesses change this <i>highly efficient</i> MO?\n\nWait until he hears about banks and the cursed things they build on top of excel\n\n  modern day horror show\n\nAt least they weren&#x27;t using Access.\n\n  I&#x27;ve been wondering for 25 years if there has ever been a legitimate use case for this abomination.\n\n    Trojan gift horse for undermining the competition  .. once they&#x27;re hip deep and headed deeper into Access dependancy you&#x27;re free to play the field without concern of them catching up.\n\n    In 20 years I&#x27;ve encountered precisely one Access Database that was very well designed, adequately documented, and implemented correctly - meaning people used a single instance on a specific machine, or Remote Desktop Protocol&#x27;d into same.<p>Connecting to an Access database over a network from individual client apps is a recipe for pain as the database file gets locked, so then people start saving &quot;copy of copy of copy USE THIS ONE&quot; versions and you get divergent database backends with no clean way to merge. IME this always happens for business critical Access systems with no backup and documentation at the least convenient time, and suddenly it&#x27;s IT&#x27;s problem&#x2F;fault. Yes you can connect to a SQL Server backend, but then it&#x27;s IT&#x27;s problem&#x2F;fault&#x2F;responsibility to maintain, and it takes Access out of the &quot;simple enough for business users&quot; domain.<p>That said, as a rapid app development desktop tool Access can work very well if you know its limitations. It&#x27;s somewhat surprising MS never made a 365 web-first equivalent, but that&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;d rather charge for Dynamics 365 licenses and Azure SQL hosting.\n\n  Access is great for small companies if it&#x27;s schema&#x27;d properly. The problem is when those small companies outgrow it; it&#x27;s a complete rewrite. I believe you can point it to a MSSQL backend, but it&#x27;s been a couple decades since I&#x27;ve used it.<p>It&#x27;s certainly a step up from Excel.\n\n    You&#x27;re not wrong... I used it for some small business things before I started programming. But why does MS have to treat so disrespectfully? Like they didn&#x27;t even have time to give the SQL editor a monospace font, wtf?\n\n      I dunno. They haven&#x27;t given much love to SSRS in quite a while either.\n\n  I&#x27;m not saying I work for a company that does, I&#x27;m just asking for a friend.<p>Can you recommend any actual, better alternatives?\n\n    Sqllite\n\n      With what GUI? It needs to be usable for people considering Excel is a challenge. Honest question.\n\n        I know of no easier way to quickly release a very usable gui on top of a standard relational database then Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix.\n\n        DBeaver has an Excel-ish interface for SQL. The usual rows and columns layout, you can double click a cell to edit it.<p>You do have to Save to flush the changes to the DB though, and the errors when queries are wrong or whatever are hard to read. Your users will likely be totally unable to grok the errors. I work in IT and it&#x27;s somewhat difficult for me because of the chain of error handlers (SQL -&gt; Java error type -&gt; Java error -&gt; display to user; there&#x27;s a lot of Java stuff mixed into your SQL errors).\n\nI thought Palantir was used now…\n\nLet me guess, he wants to build it in rust.\n\n&quot;Beyond Excel&quot; ! The Cloud !<p>F1 - World where IT isn&#x27;t allowed !<p>Just only MS IT...<p>On the other hand Excel looks like quite stable piece of software - more then 1 milion  of rows... (\\s &amp; ^\\s)"

However, from a financial standpoint, you can access Microsoft Office for free by using its web version. This version includes many features found in the desktop variants and may suffice for numerous use cases.<p>Personally, I find the perpetual licenses less appealing because they are costly, particularly when used on multiple devices. For instance, with a perpetual license, you&#x27;re typically limited to installing it on just a desktop and a laptop. In contrast, subscriptions offer greater flexibility in this respect, accommodating usage across several devices."

Was spending time looking into Rust lambdas, but was reluctant about the total build times for my stacks and getting new team members onboarded with lambdas. (Though in fairness, Rust lambdas tend to be short and digestible, which are perfect for Rust novices.)<p>LLRT is basically no learning curve. Same old esbuild most TS and JS devs are used to. I guess we&#x27;re sticking with one language from front to back again:<p>CDK in TS, lambdas in TS, and frontend logic in TS.\n\n  This is how I did it at my previous job. A clever setup allows you to have frontend&#x2F;backend end-to-end type safety. We even made our lambda environment variables typed, through to the CDK code that populated them.\n\n  Yeah, but don&#x27;t expect the same execution speed or memory consumption.<p>In fairness I would rather pick Go, C# with Native AOT, or Java with GraalVM, if Rust build times are such a pain point.<p>Keep the performance of compiled languages, with faster build times, no need to switch to a bare bones interpreter.\n\n    I could not find GraalVM Native Image references in official AWS documentation so it may be a scenario that requires work on the user’s end.<p>Native AOT OTOH has first-party support and is the recommended deployment target: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;dotnet-native-aot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;dotnet-native-a...</a><p>(fun fact: AWS beat Azure to it with its support)\n\n      From Amazom themselves, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samples&#x2F;serverless-graalvm-demo\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samples&#x2F;serverless-graalvm-demo</a>\n\n    90% of the time, our lambdas are just making AWS SDK calls or querying data stores like Postgres, Redis, and DynamoDB. The limits are in memory consumption or raw CPU processing but network and service latencies. Those are precisely the workloads where Rust (or Go) can&#x27;t provide much benefit. The only drawback really was Node&#x27;s cold start times and JIT overhead that was never really used. Python was faster, but a similar story.<p>LLRT gives the quick dev and deployment time, automatic OS and SDK updates (when using a zip rather than Docker image), and very low cold start latencies. The rest is nothing much more than await-ing network responses.<p>Obviously if it were calculating millions of hashes, rendering images, and other similar tasks, I&#x27;d run to Rust or Go. But the default looks to be LLRT.<p>Any larger program with thousands of lines of code or more wouldn&#x27;t be in TypeScript. But for a twenty-line lambda, especially with JSDoc that has no separate build step? No brainer for me in terms of cost-benefit.\n\nI noticed that you can use QuickJS as en embedded scripting language within Python.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PetterS&#x2F;quickjs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PetterS&#x2F;quickjs</a>\n\n&gt; This also means that its size is tiny, in the order of a few kilobytes in contrast to the 20+MB required by its counterparts.<p>A full, performant ES2023 runtime, in &quot;the order of a few kilobytes&quot;? Even when you remove all JIT and GC, that sounds too fantastic.<p>I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it.\n\n  QuickJS is well known and has been around for a while: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;quickjs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;quickjs&#x2F;</a>\n\n    Sure, but as the linked page mentions, QuickJS is 210KiB, which is seemingly larger than &quot;in the order of a few kilobytes&quot; claimed by the subject&#x27;s blog post.\n\nIs there a writeup somewhere by someone with a slightly stronger command of English?\n\n  the original post from a month ago may help you, depending on how much &quot;blog&quot; you&#x27;re looking for from the experience: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39304188\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39304188</a>\n\nThis post is a reminder that you can run anything on Lambda if you&#x27;re willing to run it as a Docker container! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;images-create.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;images-create.h...</a><p>I don&#x27;t mess with AWS&#x27;s default runtimes anymore!\n\nAs always, emacs did it first: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;707615&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;707615&#x2F;</a>\n\nAlso though, this is a gross gross mis-optimization. Every tenant having to carry their own runtime is a huge cost penalty. That it&#x27;s a much less cost? Fine great wonderful, yeah. But there should be much much much more ability to share runtime &amp; ideally modules too. V8 isolates &amp; wasm sandboxed modules hopefully can deliver on a thicker runtime, but which doesn&#x27;t require each tenant to host the world themselves. That is never going to be fast or good or to your scale-to-zero advantage. We can should &amp; must explore better.\n\n  And with a JIT.<p>With the world watching in dismay Python being the last dynamic language standing to finally adopt a JIT into their reference implementation, is kind of strange to take it out of the picture."

I recall you need a special and weird algorithm to parse html properly. Was a long time ago though, dunno if that was &quot;fixed&quot;.\n\n  That&#x27;s largely correct. HTML5 changed the status quo from &quot;eh, it should be XML but every browser applies its own weird hacks&quot; to &quot;well, the hacks still apply but at least they&#x27;re defined by the standard now&quot;. The proper solution would have been XHTML, but we can&#x27;t have nice things.<p>This seems to use html5ever[0], which is a &quot;proper&quot; HTML browser also used by the Servo browser.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;servo&#x2F;html5ever\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;servo&#x2F;html5ever</a>\n\n    So there is a rigorous definition of a brain damage parser for HTML.<p>Where is this defined already?

      "conversation_text": "It‘s similar to how some people in the company’s chat first initiate a longish back and forth of formal chit-chat before actually coming to the point of asking their question. I know full well from the first „hi“ that there will be coming a question my way at some point later but now I have to stop what I was doing and engage in an unnecessary real-time conversation to enable the other side to ask. Whereas if they just asked the question outright it would not matter if I was AFK at the time. I can simply answer asynchronous.<p>When I come back after lunch and find a message saying simply „hi“ from 30 minutes ago and now that person is AFK it spreads out the conversation over the whole day.<p>I am not saying you should drop the formalities, but there is nothing that forces you to split it up into multiple messages. Just write „Hi“ followed by the question in the same message.\n\n  You might appreciate nohello.net .\n\n    Nice, I will now send out that link (in a polite way of course)\n\n  &gt; „hi“<p>For the record, in English, quotation marks are always above letters: &#x27;like this&#x27; or &quot;like this&quot; (or, ‘like thisʼ and “like this”, to use the typographically more correct glyphs, although HN renders all of these pretty badly with Verdana).<p>Single or double is a matter of style—British English style guides tend to prefer &#x27;single quotation marks&#x27;, and North American English style guides prefer &quot;double quotation marks&quot;. But alternate between the two for nested quotes (or avoid nesting to improve clarity):<p>Joe said &#x27;Jen said &quot;yes!&quot; when I asked her to marry me!&#x27;<p>„This“ style is strictly German, as far as I can see.\n\n    Yes, you are correct, I am using a German keyboard and German autocorrect on my smartphone.\n\n    Also Polish. I always found it ugly though and I use the &quot;English&quot; one (which often annoyed my Polish teachers).\n\n      Polish and German styles are similar, but not identical:<p>„hi“ (German; ends with U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK)<p>„hi” (Polish; ends with U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK)\n\n  I just wait for them to explain their problem. If they don&#x27;t, guess it wasn&#x27;t that important...\n\n  Hmm I totally get where you’re coming from but I have used a “hi” in the past to basically probe and figure out if a friend or colleague is available for real time conversation because I suspect that the conversation will need to be a quick back and forth, lasting only minutes, rather than an extended asynchronous chain lasting multiple days.\n\n    Why not simply ask?<p>&quot;Hi $COLLEAGUE. I&#x27;m having a problem with $TASK: I&#x27;m trying to accomplish $GOAL but I keep seeing $ERROR. I&#x27;ve tried $WORKAROUNDS, but none of them have fixed the problem. I think it will be fastest if I can demo this for you; do you have 10 minutes so I can walk you through it interactively?&quot;\n\n      Exactly. Please stop saying &quot;hi&quot; and waiting for a response, just say what you need in the first message. This is a great template.\n\n      You’re not wrong. I think the problem here is that the context of who we’re talking to is missing. I only talk to people in this way who I know well and do the same with me, I have like 3 people in mind. \nI can understand how it would be frustrating if you did this with someone random at your company.\n\n  I work with some teams in India and I am ~12 hours offset time wise. I find that they often will often just send “Hi” in Slack. By the time I see that, they are already offline. If I respond with something like “What can I do for you?”, it will be another 12 hours before they see that and then another 12 hours still before I can see whatever request they make.<p>I’ve tried to suggest to some of them that they lead with their request, but that has not helped much.\n\n  it&#x27;s like a human version of the tcp protocol\n\n    It&#x27;s actually the opposite. 3-way handshake is the way to check that the communication channel is established and humans do it all the time.<p>- hey!<p>- what?<p>- we need to talk.\n\nDoes this work with medical emergencies?<p>Don&#x27;t say presumptious, lazy shit that walls people out like, &quot;Is there a doctor in the house?&quot;<p>Instead, say, &quot;Help! How do I bleed (so to speak) bubbles of air out of someone&#x27;s aorta?&quot;\n\n  No, you ask for what you want. &quot;Person X has air in their Aorta, I need a doctor quickly, this is an emergency!&quot;<p>Similarily if the person with the Java question needed an expert to do something for them they could have asked: &quot;Any Java expert here willing to take a job? You can contact me at foo@bar.org&quot;<p>Your question is valid if you&#x27;re the doctor yourself and just need a piece of knowledge to fix things yourself (as isn&#x27;t uncommon in the programming world)\n\n  Is this a serious comment?\n\n    The question is, is this a serious article? Just let people ask, is there Java expert here. Who cares?\n\n      I would say the page explains who might care and why they might care. Could you elaborate on why you disagree with the reasoning?\n\n&quot;Hey atoav, may I ask you something?&quot;<p>&quot;Yeah, you already did.&quot;\n\n  Can I ask you another?\n\n    You confidently have proven so.\n\n      What about now?\n\n        What about it?\n\nSimilar: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nohello.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nohello.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>\n\n  I am very tempted to send this to my mom but she would almost certainly take the act as passive aggressive.<p>She will send me ”Hello” followed by more frantic “Hello?” and “Hello???” ‘s, sometimes even at very odd hours because she’s retired.<p>This isn’t a telephone. Ask what you are going to ask or tell me what you’re going to tell me. We don’t have to make this a synchronous conversation. If we do, call me.<p>On Monday, literally after midnight and she had to get my undivided attention just to tell me she was going to rent a room for their anniversary party in June. “Ok” I reply\n\n    Enjoy it!\nYou&#x27;ll miss her when she&#x27;s gone.\n\nIn a similar vein, I have a couple coworkers who regularly DM me on Slack to ask “Hey, can I ask you a question?”<p>First off, you already have.<p>Second, you know the answer is yes. Why ask?<p>Thirdly, you’ve wasted my time and made this potentially asynchronous interaction synchronous. After typing “sure” and hitting enter I am basically entirely guaranteed to sit and wait for your second question because you have already interrupted my thought process and whatever I was doing.\n\n  I’ve never personally been bothered by the ask-to-ask, the reality is I have a 100 WPM typing speed and “Sure, Whaddya got” is muscle memory at this point in life. Pleasantries and social oddities are just part of being a human after all.<p>What bothers me is the folks that ask-to-ask then go ghost for 15 minutes or more. You’ve captured my attention, please capitalize on it! If you’ve broken my concentration and walked away, _that_ is rude.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think the point is effort per se, but rather distractions and context-switching.<p>(Pretty sure most of us can type at or above that speed :)\n\n    &gt; You’ve captured my attention, please capitalize on it! If you’ve broken my concentration and walked away, _that_ is rude.<p>I&#x27;d venture to say that&#x27;s probably caused by a chaotic mess on their end. I don&#x27;t take this as a judgement of their character unless someone else from their side of the house who is a sibling on the org chart is more disciplined to not do this to me.\n\nI have a morbid curiosity to know what kind of person decotes their time to put together a website to make this point.\n\n  I mean... something like this can be put up in less than an hour. Certainly worth the (little) effort if it&#x27;s a point you&#x27;re constantly making already\n\n  I thank them for their service. I have referred this site hundreds of times answering questions in various online communities.\n\nAmusingly, this same topic is on Twitter at the moment, where the dominant opinion seems to be “let people communicate however they want, don’t try to change that.”<p>It’s Twitter, so I don’t take it particularly seriously, but I also find it ironic how the same people who will say that you must let people be themselves do not want to let me be myself. I despise small talk. My productivity plummets if I have to work in an office, because people keep talking about nothing.<p>If you have an actual technical question, by all means, hit me up and I’ll be happy to engage you. But otherwise, no, I’d rather just keep focusing on whatever I&#x27;m working on.\n\nThe examples given are more about inexperience talking with skilled people and less about etiquette. Same thing happens when you directly talk to anyone else with deeper knowledge of any kind.<p>For anyone reading this that is not a dev just ask us what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish without the formalities. If the dev throws a tantrum, they&#x27;re still green and you should try to ask up the org chart if possible. Otherwise don&#x27;t hesitate to ask the dev if there&#x27;s someone who is a better fit for your question.<p>I do agree with the general idea behind this post though. We ask for brevity because we know, and you do too, that the conversation is going to be a long slog. We are not reassured by your formalities that this is going to be a clean one. Nobody likes to feel embarrassed or dumb. There&#x27;s no way around this, just dive in please. I&#x27;ve been doing this for over a decade and I have been humbled many times by the broader business concerns I had no clue about. It happens."

Racism is an intent, simply saying the work was outsourced to India could be as benign as having incorrect information and absolutely doesn&#x27;t say anything about the people of India themselves.\n\n              The work is done IN CHICAGOLAND!<p>I have managed and sold products or funded companies that have sold to the very same guys who do this stuff at McDs and insert_F1000_here<p>The fact you automatically assume &quot;India&quot; is sheer racism, as if all good programmers are only in the US and all bad ones in India.<p>Newsflash - all humans are kinda good and kinda bad.\n\n                Fair enough, I think that falls into incorrect information then. I didn&#x27;t make the original claim and wouldn&#x27;t have assumed it was outsourced at all, I have no idea the inner dynamics of McDonald&#x27;s engineering teams.<p>My point was simply that saying the work was outsourced to India isn&#x27;t itself enough to make a very real claim that someone is racist.<p>Having incorrect information isn&#x27;t racist, making an assumption that outsourced work went to India <i>if</i> that matches a person&#x27;s experience with outsourced IT work ending up in India isn&#x27;t racist, and saying the country to which work may have been outsourced to says absolutely nothing about the people there.\n\n        India is sadly at the forefront of low-quality tech sweatshops and may have even pioneered the concept... but not to worry, with remote work I&#x27;m sure other countries will catch up eventually too!\n\n          So are Ukraine, Romania, and Poland.<p>In McD&#x27;s and ATT&#x27;s case (because you commented on that as well) - their platform and security teams are located at HQ in the Central Sales Zone\n\n            &gt; Ukraine, Romania, and Poland.<p>They have to compete with India (because otherwise why would you go there instead of just going with India) so they have to justify it by offering at least a slightly higher quality bar to differentiate themselves from a market saturated by low-quality sweatshops. Personal experience, I don&#x27;t (yet) get spam emails offering me dev services from Eastern Europe (or Thailand&#x2F;Philippines for that matter) but I&#x27;ve had my fair share of &quot;agencies&quot; promising me the moon at cheap prices, with all signs pointing that the origin of those is India.<p>---<p>&gt; In McD&#x27;s and ATT&#x27;s case<p>The problem with large, non-IT &quot;legacy&quot; companies is less outsourcing itself (although outsourcing is a symptom of it) but that there is no healthy engineering culture. Nobody competent joins&#x2F;stays there because if you&#x27;re competent and actually want that skill to be rewarded you&#x27;ll have much better options, so the only thing that remains is mediocrity.<p>Since you mentioned ATT, ask yourself why there is zero innovation coming out of the telco space? It is after all just bits and bytes (and with things like IMS&#x2F;VoLTE more and more of it is bog standard IP and SIP). We&#x27;ve seen innovation in banking (see challenger banks in the UK), we&#x27;ve seen it in electric utilities (Octopus Energy in the UK has a healthy Python-focused engineering arm), yet for some reason nothing ever comes out of telcos beyond excuses to misbill people and coming up with ever-outlandish use-cases for 5G.\n\n              &gt; Personal experience, I don&#x27;t (yet) get spam emails offering me dev services from Eastern Europe (or Thailand&#x2F;Philippines for that matter) but I&#x27;ve had my fair share of &quot;agencies&quot; promising me the moon at cheap prices, with all signs pointing that the origin of those is India.<p>Personal experience does not give you the right to be prejudiced.<p>And ime EPAM and ELITEX have been equally as horrid as WITCH, yet I don&#x27;t presume all East European programmers suck.<p>&gt; why there is zero innovation coming out of the telco space<p>Plenty of innovation happens. They were some of the earliest adopters of Cloud and K8s, and a number of features and products that CSPs like AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, etc now sell were initially developed by telcos and then resold to the CSPs.<p>---------<p>I get it, you&#x27;re a freelancer&#x2F;contractor and you must be jaded due to competition, yet in all honesty you aren&#x27;t any different than a drone at EPAM or TCS.<p>If you are going to be publicly prejudiced, at least have the decency to be anonymous and not directly link your professional information.<p>It&#x27;s a small industry\n\n                &gt; Plenty of innovation happens<p>Over a decade ago, sure.<p>Nowadays, it seems like they&#x27;re struggling with basic things like defending against social-engineered SIM swaps (even when the account has an explicit note about it) and not leaking data (not talking about the &quot;contested&quot; AT&amp;T breach, but the fully admitted T-Mobile one for example)?<p>But don&#x27;t take it from me, here&#x27;s a more reliable source with way more experience in the field: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;berthub.eu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;posts&#x2F;5g-elephant-in-the-room&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;berthub.eu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;posts&#x2F;5g-elephant-in-the-room&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; you must be jaded due to competition<p>Outsourced sweatshops aren&#x27;t meaningful competition for me - they have their customers and I have mine, and those rarely intersect. The sales pipeline and target market is completely different. My problem with them is more that they often manage to get government contracts (and thus get tax money) and then deliver no&#x2F;subpar results.<p>---<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s clear we have a different view on these things so let&#x27;s agree to disagree - my mistake is your opportunity. If you feel like prejudice against common outsourcing sweatshops is mistaken, you are welcome to exploit it (you can do so via the stock market, or by taking on locally-priced contracts, outsourcing them and pocketing the difference).<p>&gt; have the decency to be anonymous<p>I&#x27;m trying to share my experience and opinion, not fire cheap shots under the cover of a throwaway.

The microbreweries at attempt them here in the US just suck. I miss a nice Spitfire XPA.\n\n  I worked for one of the affected companies as a rare example of a permanent, in-house engineer.<p>They had a _lot_ of contractors, some independent based in the UK, some contracts with companies with a local presence who would work from the office alongside us, and some in India.<p>All were equally shit at worst, with only the independent contractors proving the exception on occasion.<p>I recall being stuck with “senior” colleagues who couldn’t manage to upgrade a dependency even while being handheld.\n\n  Considering chat GPT is a few  years old it seems unlikely those who used it in university and are now probably just Junior Developers are responsible for wide spread outages at major companies\n\nThey could definitely all be unconnected.

Isbell makes a fair point, and it&#x27;s more of a societal problem than a computing specific problem.<p>My intuition is that if medical school students memorize Anki decks, they&#x27;re going to be good at pattern matching but not seeing the big picture and why things happen. People react poorly to being challenged, responding with either aggression or avoidance. Rarely do they ask themselves why something is the case.<p>Business people might know how to increase revenue but not understand what money is, how it is created and destroyed, and how it affects people&#x27;s incentives.<p>- I&#x27;m not sure the computing ethos is taught particularly well in schools. For example, the Unix Philosophy for writing command line tools or GNU&#x27;s free software. In my view, colleges should be an fast feedback learning environment with significant input from teachers, fundamental readings, and exposure to new things to point people in the right direction.<p>- Philosophy, math, and CS are a strong combination that go well together. I&#x27;m not surprised the author found himself at home in it.<p>- I don&#x27;t worry that people get into CS and care only about machines. I worry that people are getting into CS only for the money, leading to the enshittification of everything. The problem is the moral values of society as a whole.<p>---<p>Fundamentally, Georgia Tech as a school strikes me as an industrial research&#x2F;engineering powerhouse funded by federal grants, a major workforce contributor to F500 companies, and at its core a public school with the attitude and values students at public schools often have such as anti-intellectualism, which is promoted and visible in the administration and can be seen in how Georgia Tech changed its logo from a more academic, serious logo to an unserious logo. But this is a growing problem at universities everywhere across the US. Housing shortages, university degree oversupply, and so on.<p>The weakness in its CS curriculum is actually its threads, causing a lack of breadth. By focusing on a thread such as &quot;People&#x2F;Media,&quot; they can pick classes that don&#x27;t even touch fundamental aspects of computing such as databases, networking, compilers, programming languages, and so on. Apparently CS is switching to a direct admit method to stop the 500-600 person classes I&#x27;ve had for almost the entirety of college.<p>I did have classes that focused on interesting topics such as law, differential privacy, cross-border data flows, philosophy and cognition, and so on. Particular classes I enjoyed were taught by teachers such as Galil, Swire, and Verma, where I felt the class content was serious, but this might also mirror my changing tastes in how education should be done as I get older. The harder and more serious the content and reading in a class is, the easier it actually is.<p>And there&#x27;s also a big maturity and understanding change that happens as well, which I don&#x27;t really think is changeable.\n\n  Some other thoughts:<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how the future of GT will fare being a public school. A large reason for the lead was how early the school established the College of Computing.<p>Will private schools end up a better place to study CS due to their smaller class sizes and less variance in the student population? I can&#x27;t say for sure due to not personally knowing what studying at those private schools is like, but I think large lecture halls are ineffectual as a continued method of higher education.<p>Another phenomenon is the amount of international students who come to the USA and are so focused on the idea and prestige of working for &quot;Big Tech.&quot; Then they get there and find out how expensive the rent is, how expensive college was, and they spent all their time doing leetcode (which actually has some interesting fundamentals if you get really into it, it&#x27;s not my thing personally though) and now graduate and think: now what?\n\n    &gt; being a public school<p>Fairly strong. There are DoD and DoE requirements that bias in favor of pushing R&amp;D funding into Public Universities.<p>GATech&#x27;s early lead in computing was because of it&#x27;s longstanding relationship with the US Navy&#x27;s Nuclear and Aerospace Programs (both of which have significant HPC needs).<p>It&#x27;s a similar story at UCB, UIUC, UMich, UT Austin, UW, etc.<p>Aside from MIT, Stanford, and Cornell, the bulk of DoE and DoD funding ends up at public universities.<p>&gt; private schools end up a better place to study CS due to their smaller class sizes and less variance<p>I attended an Ivy Level CS program for undergrad. My sibling attended a Tier 1 public school program for CS.<p>My sibling&#x27;s CS education was superior, as the public university was able to hire way more faculty at better rates, as most decent public universities have multiple DoD and DoE universities and grantmakers to entice faculty and graduate students.<p>If it isn&#x27;t Stanford, Cornell, or MIT, I&#x27;d say the CS curriculum is middling at a private.<p>I myself wish I attended GATech instead of my supposedly &quot;prestigious&quot; undergrad as the research and industrial opportunities at a Tier 1&#x2F;2 Public CS program like a upper Tier UC, UW, GT, UIUC, etc are hard to beat almost anywhere.<p>I think the main benefit an elite private school might have is a better support system, but by and large, the student base is largely comparable - if you&#x27;re Berkeley EECS or UT Austin&#x2F;UW direct CS you would have had stats comparable to a Stanford or MIT undergrad\n\n      ^ edit: And CMU. Totally forgot about CMU even though it&#x27;s S-tier\n\n      Didn&#x27;t know that about the DoD and DoE, good to know. What was your experience and your sister&#x27;s experience (and at what places) if you don&#x27;t mind me asking?\n\n  &quot;...&#x27;People&#x2F;Media,&#x27; they can pick classes that don&#x27;t even touch fundamental aspects of computing such as databases, networking, compilers, programming languages, and so on.&quot;<p>There is a lot of this. Many students are not suited to a technical degree, but the college wants their tuition. So call a program CS, while removing all the technical stuff.<p>So what, if the student will go out, get a CS job, and fall on their face? It&#x27;s not the college&#x27;s problem at that point. &#x2F;s\n\n  From the ignorance of a European scholar: what is anti-intellectualism? What role does it play in an academic institution?\n\n    That&#x27;s just the personal term I use to describe it, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a mix of lack of life experience, lack of expectations from the school, personal attitudes, lack of seriousness, lecture-hall style teaching and too many students, and low standards.<p>Examples:<p>- vandalizing all signs with the letter &#x27;t&#x27; around the school because the school has a reputation for &quot;stealing a giant T&quot; from a building, but all the students are too busy with career stuff to do anything like that<p>- saying &quot;I want a job that pays me the most money&quot;<p>- walking out in the middle of class after an attendance quiz<p>- administrative staff sending out emails with numerous typos<p>- lack of serious thought into important topics<p>I think American college students tend to be less mature than European ones due to being stuck in a suburb for 18 years as well.<p>I liked this article about universities: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;how-universities-work-or-what-i-wish-id-known-freshman-year-a-guide-to-american-university-life-for-the-uninitiated&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;how-universities-work-or-...</a>\n\n      Overall, I see a conversion towards mcdonalds-style university management happening world-wide. More or less what you explain, also based mostly on PR.\n\n&gt; Rather, they are proceeding as though it were a technical school for producing a certain variety of very well-paid professionals.<p>I would venture that if you asked the majority of students in CS what they wanted, a non-controversial path to highly paid professionals is precisely what they signed up and paid for.\n\n  I think you&#x27;re right. Steve Jobs would find it tragic, though, I&#x27;d wager.\n\nI studied undergrad CS at JMU from 1995 - 1999. When I entered and when I left I got to witness the program change. In 1995 I would say everyone in the program was interested in computers and had a genuine interest in programming and doing computer stuff. By the time I left I definitely saw people entering the program that were less interested in computing and more interested in making money in a stable career or getting rich. I witnessed that change.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are still lots of people majoring in CS that have a genuine interest in studying computation. For me, I would much rather work with people who have a genuine interest in CS, one that is not based in the promise of future earnings. They&#x27;re simply more fun to work with.\n\n  I was a CS undergrad from 2002-2006 and I think almost everyone I knew was there because they were very interested in technology. I wonder if the .com bubble bursting had reset that? I didn’t notice a significant number of people entering the field purely for money until the early 2010s.\n\n    There were six people on my Intel supported CompEng course in 2005, down from over 100.\n\nComputers have been a hobby all my life. I well remember the epiphany I felt while learning Logo in elementary school, at the moment I understood what recursion is. I don&#x27;t think the fact that the language I have mostly written code in in recent years is Emacs Lisp is unrelated to the above moment.<p>Yet I have never desired to work as a professional software developer. I majored in history and Spanish at Columbia while working for the university&#x27;s Unix systems group. Before graduation I interviewed and got offers (including one explicitly as a developer) at various tech startups. Of my offers I chose an investment banking job where I worked with tech companies; my manager was looking for a CS major but I was able to convince her that I had the equivalent thereof. Thank goodness for that; I got to participate in the dotcom bubble without being directly swept up in its popping, and saw the Valley immediately post-bubble collapse. &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34732772\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34732772</a>&gt;<p>I&#x27;m glad, for the sake of civilizational and economic progress, that others are able and willing to program for pay. Meanwhile I will continue to putter around with Elisp at home.\n\n  If you like the theory of computing and thinking like a computer scientist, aka computational systems and algorithms, then a degree in computer science makes sense.  It has two sides, a logic&#x2F;math background and an\nexperimental side (systems building).  It also blurs with math, physics, statistics at the edges where you see cross collaboration.  Computer scientists like to take things from different fields and push them to extreme scale.  Deep learning is one example. Graphical models are another (taken from Bayesian stats) and applied to graphs.<p>But in some sense a liberal arts degree is more useful.\n\nThe title is crap but the message is on point: CS is an interdisciplinary field and supporting cross-discipline education in CS is very useful - look at applications from NLP to UX to EDM<p>I think CMU&#x27;s approach of requiring SCS students minor in a non-Eng major is a fairly useful way of helping inculcate that skill.<p>Sadly, most universities suck at making degrees more open ended due to Administrative laziness.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;SLknv\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;SLknv</a>\n\nA thousand words in, and still no clue what the problem is.\n\n  I agree this is a tough one. Read the last paragraph first, then jump back.\n\n  It&#x27;s the classic liberal arts argument, applied to CS.<p>&gt; None of the deans I spoke with aspires to launch, say, a department of art within their college of computing, or one of politics, sociology, or film. Their vision does not reflect the idea that computing can or should be a superordinate realm of scholarship, on the order of the arts or engineering. Rather, they are proceeding as though it were a technical school for producing a certain variety of very well-paid professionals. A computing college deserving of the name wouldn’t just provide deeper coursework in CS and its closely adjacent fields; it would expand and reinvent other, seemingly remote disciplines for the age of computation.<p>&gt; [...] CS departments have been asked to train more software engineers without considering whether more software engineers are really what the world needs. Now I worry that they have a bigger problem to address: how to make computer people care about everything else as much as they care about computers.\n\n  Its just Silo Wars. I guess Wall Street Journal thinks using that as a title could come off as too click-baity.<p>Essentially, where do you house the CS department ? Inside the College of Arts &amp; Science ? Inside the School of Engineering ? Or a separate autonomous School of Computing ?<p>This is how it plays out in reality - when I was a CS grad student, the department was part of A&amp;S. Since Math is also Arts &amp; Sciences, they had a huge influence. You could take Math courses instead of CS &amp; get a degree in CS! So I did exactly that - took a graduate course in Graph Theory, PDE &amp; Numerical Analysis from the Math department, &amp; got out with a CS degree. Then I went to work for Sun Microsystems, where colleagues were surprised that I didn&#x27;t know the difference between a raw socket &amp; a tcp socket - shouldn&#x27;t that be taught in school ? Well, I had skipped Computer Networking, Computer Graphics &amp; Compiler Theory entirely by taking my 3 math courses. So that&#x27;s what happens if you stick it into A&amp;S - the Math faculty has too much influence.<p>3 years later, the CS department, now funded by NASA &amp; the FBI, decided to move from A&amp;S to School of Engineering. My advisor quit over that decision because he believed CS is part of Math. But then, other people joined &amp; now Robotics, IoT etc gets taught - because engineering.<p>What&#x27;s happening recently ( you can tell I live in a college town :) is that CS has gotten so big, its essentially eating up all the departments. So PhD students in EE, Math , Mech, Chem etc take 3 CS courses in the last semester - because, who wants to be an engineer&#x2F;mathematician&#x2F;etc when you can work at Google ? So those departments are like - get CS out of this place, let them have their own school so they don&#x27;t pollute our students. I have several faculty kids who took this route - got the funding from EE, Mech etc but ended up working for Google after. So there&#x27;s some justified backlash.\n\nI read this article, then came to see if it had been posted to HN.  As someone who dropped out of college and is now currently enrolled to finish my degree (well, I had to start over), my take on this is partly colored by how different things are now from then.<p>When I was previously in college, most of my instructors were folks who had been in industry at companies I had heard of or had done research I had heard of and their background was not in computer science; it was in math, physics, electrical engineering, philosophy, linguistics, and in one case logistics.  While I was focused solely on computers, my first experience through college was one characterized by instruction with multiple perspectives and a clear awareness that computer science was a cross cutting discipline that had things to learn from and things to teach to all other disciplines.  As an example my instructors with backgrounds in linguistics had an interest in language construction and syntax, how we get to where computers and humans have a shared intelligible language along with topics like natural language processing and the concepts of regular languages and regular expressions.<p>Now that I am in college again, all of my instructors either came out of CS themselves or came out of the field of education.  Few have any industry experience, none are names I have heard of due to their research.  Exactly zero have expressed any interesting opinions or perspectives that strayed from or colored in the material from the textbook.  It’s a much more rote type of instruction now.<p>The students have changed too.  When I was previously a student, I made a number of lifelong friends even though I didn’t graduate.  I would say it was 50&#x2F;50 career-focused vs tech-focused.  Now, it’s 95% career-focused, even though I am a non-traditional student I expected to connect with somebody around the joy of technology, but my only non-class interactions have been driven by people hoping I can refer them for jobs.<p>I am not sure I agree with the conclusions of the author.  I don’t think the specific bureaucratic structure of an academic discipline is that important for how the students turn out, I think it is far more important what intent the students and instructors come into class with.  What I am seeing does not bode well though, it seems the nerds like myself are not dying out but are drowned out by a sea of people who are singled minded and focused on career, grinding out CS because it leads to high pay, not because they want to understand anything at depth or try to attain and share new insights.\n\n  I can understand this. When I studied CS at UMD College Park in the early 2000s, it wasn&#x27;t that much of a pop-culture a glamorous field yet. So most of the kids doing it were actually interested in programming and algorithms etc. And jobs, opportunities, and job offers were aplenty.<p>But now that we&#x27;ve had nearly 20 years of FAANG companies growing into the stratosphere, surrounded by software and smartphones and the riches that world has brought, I can understand that it just attracts people that want the money.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that in general (if you view college as a training program for jobs). But I would also guess that part of requests for job references might also come with ––– in the past 3 years you&#x27;ve seen a saturation of talent (via boot camps and CS degrees) but now AI is going to reduce the number of developers a company needs.<p>So for the first time in my professional career, it isn&#x27;t drop dead simple to get a job in software dev. I remember 15 years ago how much developers used to disparage recruiters because we didn&#x27;t need them to find jobs, and the power dynamic was quite imbalanced.<p>I never did even though I did have the occasional funny interaction (&quot;do you have 15 years of C#?&quot; type nonsense). But I always predicted there would be a day where all of us needed recruiters. So that day is here now. So I think it has to be VERY hard to be a college grad heading to a white collar job nowadays, CS or not, due to the hugely changing winds with AI.\n\nMarketing demand created the force that gives people the illusion that sufficient amount of people can be trained regardless of his personal interests. Thus many kids went the school for CS major and then still need to be asked to repeat coding problem solutions.\n\nOn the academic death march from deprecating the humanities to deprecating the sciences, we&#x27;ve arrived at the need for the art of human sciences that are holistic enough to realize that neither the extremes of poetry nor the extremes of programming can make sense of the need to transcend the absurd when neither a linear algebra of words nor a probabilistic calculus of language can cross the liminal chasm between logic and reason successfully without unintended consequences, much like the century between Taylor and Postman defined the decades that followed them, respectively.\n\nI agree with the author that CS should be more integrated with other departments. But the author focuses on requiring CS majors to study French, and I&#x27;m more interested in the opposite: why shouldn&#x27;t we require French lit majors to study Python?<p>In liberal arts circles, there&#x27;s a widespread attitude that programming is an alien thing. And this attitude extends to programmers as well; the article portrays &quot;computer people&quot; as an outgroup. I think this attitude is deeply unhealthy. Python isn&#x27;t some kind of incomprehensible gobbledygook! Basic programming skills should be considered part of a well-rounded education, applicable to many different fields, just like reading, writing, and math.<p>There are some steps in the right direction:<p>&gt; [Mark Guzdial] is trying to rebuild computing education from scratch, for students in fields such as French and sociology. He wants them to understand it as a means of self-expression or achieving justice--and not just a way of making software, or money.<p>This is great, but the author doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that many people in CS _already_ view programming as a means of self-expression or achieving justice (e.g. the free software movement, PGP, Mastodon). The liberal arts folks are the ones who think CS is just a way of making money.<p>I wish people would stop portraying computing as an isolated, inaccessible thing; and start viewing it as a part of modern society that every educated person should know the fundamentals of.\n\n  I think it&#x27;s only marginally useful for programming to be part of a broad education. You need fairly sophisticated programming (and non-programming, like git, tooling, etc) skills to do most things worth doing and the barrier is only getting higher.<p>Our society runs on code sure, but it also runs on alloys and we don&#x27;t expect a well-educated person to know industrial metallurgy either you know? It certainly makes sense to teach some models of computation, computers aren&#x27;t magic and shouldn&#x27;t be thought of that way. But it&#x27;s fine to treat programming as a highly specialized technical domain like actuary or crop science or eye surgery or welding or whatever. Plenty of important useful concrete skills are not taught except to people expecting to use them professionally.<p>Anecdotally though I know a lot more creative and humanities people who can code than I do programmers who can dance or write a poem. The self-identity of &quot;computer people&quot; has long been as an aggrieved, besieged outgroup. To whatever extent we are alien I think we chose that for ourselves. We can change it but we shouldn&#x27;t start by blaming anyone else for it.\n\n    I 100% disagree. Teaching basic programming is teaching how computers actually work.<p>We&#x27;re running into tons of computer literature issues right now. Lots of people coming out of highschool today don&#x27;t know what a file tree is because everything they&#x27;ve used up until this point is in an app or browser.<p>We don&#x27;t teach everyone how to be electricians or plumbers, but we do teach everyone the basics of how electricity and plumbing work.<p>It&#x27;s important that people understand the basics of how the things they interact with every day work.\n\n    &gt; I think it&#x27;s only marginally useful for programming to be part of a broad education.<p>On the contrary, I think a few semesters of basic computing can teach a lot of valuable skills:<p>- Basic Python skills are sufficient for a lot of scientific data analysis.<p>- Computing has become an important part of society; so, understanding how computers work is important for being an informed citizen. E.g. understanding the limitations of Incognito Mode in a web browser; or what Bitcoin is and what it isn&#x27;t; or the difference between centralized platforms and the fediverse.<p>- Perhaps most importantly, teaching people Python will help dispel the myth that software is some kind of incomprehensible magic.<p>Certainly, a few semesters studying Python wouldn&#x27;t be enough to get a high-paying CS job; but it would be no less valuable than a few semesters spent studying French.<p>&gt; The self-identity of &quot;computer people&quot; has long been as an aggrieved, besieged outgroup. To whatever extent we are alien I think we chose that for ourselves.<p>There&#x27;s a very real history of negative stereotyping about nerds. It&#x27;s not OK for you to ignore that or pretend it didn&#x27;t happen. I never consented to be stereotyped, excluded, or treated as alien.\n\n    There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of waste and inefficiency in non-technical knowledge work that could be solved if it was expected that a well-rounded education included teaching someone how to do some basic scripting.\n\n  <i>How to Design Programs</i> [0] is a great example of computing as another pillar of a well-rounded liberal arts education. The Preface and Epilogue explain this perspective in more detail.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htdp.org&#x2F;2023-8-14&#x2F;Book&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htdp.org&#x2F;2023-8-14&#x2F;Book&#x2F;index.html</a>\n\n  <i>CS should be more integrated with other departments</i><p>it is almost disappointing that we still have not learned this everywhere. this is not new. already when i studied a few decades ago at my university the computer science major allowed you to pick any other field as a minor.<p>there was no active integration of the fields, but the argumentation was that computer science was applicable everywhere, so any combination would make sense. most other majors did not give you that kind of freedom, and i have not heard from any other universities offering this choice to their CS majors, but i did hear from several that required math as a minor to go along with CS.<p>i don&#x27;t know if the reverse was true though. i doubt it. physics definitely required math as a minor and didn&#x27;t allow a choice. and i doubt many other departments allowed students to choose CS as a minor. it would be a great idea though.<p>i also agree with you that every student should learn programming, but for me that makes programming a class that should already be required in highschool, and at least be offered in middle school, if not earlier. just like learning english as a second language is required in pretty much every country that is not english native, and in many offered already in primary school.\n\n&gt; <i>Universities are conservative institutions, steeped in tradition.</i><p>This is wrong though. Universities should be breeding grounds for new ideas and be on the edge of change: social, economic, technological.<p>Only certain core tenets should be carved in stone and enshrined by a university. Not how it is divided into colleges or structured and administered a corporation or whatever."

There&#x27;s no organized theft rings! and so on.<p>It&#x27;s so hard to keep up with History today.\n\n  Crime can be down and there also can be organized theft rings. Do you see why?\n\n    The most obvious reason why is that by crime you mean reported crime, and by reported crime you mean reported crime reported to the FBI.<p>(E.G., <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themarshallproject.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;see-if-police-in-your-state-reported-crime-data-to-the-fbi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themarshallproject.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;see-if-police-...</a>)\n\n    There seems to be an essential confusion between police refusing to investigate low-level theft without bodily harm (non-felony shoplifting, snatch-and-run, hit-and-run without injury) and the resulting (and inaccurate) lower crime rates. While not necessarily true of more serious (high-value or violent crimes) it is entirely possible for actual minor crime rates to rise while reported crime rates decrease.\n\n      Sure, but the parent I responded to seems to be trying to make an &quot;aha!&quot; here based on the fact that there are in fact crime rings, that crime is not <i>actually</i> down, which is a completely fallacious conclusion.\n\nI had my bag stolen with clothes + work laptop out of my rental car in San Francisco, from the trunk, while parked in an underground garage with security on patrol.<p>SF has an especially bad problem with shoplifting and robberies, but it&#x27;s happening in a lot of other places too.<p>A friend who worked in a senior position at a FAANG had his phone stolen while it was unlocked, and within minutes they had disabled Find My. They had full access to his work accounts + private data + identity documents for several hours, so he has to get everything replaced. Crazy that for most folks the most valuable assets isn&#x27;t the device itself but the information on it, and criminals have started to realize that.\n\n  I deleted by bank app from my cell phone for this reason alone.\n\n    Don&#x27;t bank apps require logging even explicitly even if the phone is unlocked?\n\n      Apparently not all cash apps do.  My bank apps require some form of login but things like Venmo do not.\n\n      Yeah almost all finance apps do. Used to work at Robinhood and this was actually my feature, otherwise we&#x27;d just see ridiculous levels of fraud and have to end up eating the cost of it.\n\n  I’m more concerned about how you’d go about disabling Find My on a locked device that doesn’t have an user replaceable battery either.<p>(I’m not disputing your experience, I just want to know because I can’t find any info on how to disable it on a locked device.)\n\n    They said the device was unlocked when they stole it.\n\n    Unless there was an edit, the GP says the phone was unlocked. I&#x27;m guessing the recent iOS changes about not allowing Find My disabled when it is away from known locations was made specifically for this situation.\n\n      Find My always requires the Apple ID and password. Almost every recent phone I’ve owned has been traded in at the end and I have to put my password in to disable Find My.<p>Apple also requires it if you need them to work on your phone&#x2F;computer at the store. I did it last month.\n\n    It was unlocked. Still, you typically need the iCloud password to disable Find My.\n\n    Mug person, preferably while intoxicated. Use face I&#x27;d to get access to phone.<p>The amount of times as a tech fixing some crap on folks devices I just pick their crapples up and face Id myself into their phones for a auth pass before they even realize what has happened is too many. Face ID is a hella big security hole. People are slow to react. You can be in and auth&#x27;d before they even ask &quot;hey what are doing?&quot;\n\n    Yeah it was unlocked. My friend said what they did initially was to completely disconnect it from all cellular networks so Find My couldn&#x27;t remotely disable it. This also meant they couldn&#x27;t connect to cloud services but there was enough data&#x2F;documents stored on the device that they still were able to get his SSN, Passport, cached messages, etc.\n\n  You cannot turn off Find My without entering your Apple ID password. The option to turn off Find My is disabled if stolen device protection is enabled.\n\n    If you can get the PIN (shoulder surfing, social engineering) you can reset&#x2F;change the Apple ID password.<p>Reportedly then you can add a second face to Face ID with Set Up Alternate Appearance and get access to everything, but I have not seen that confirmed.\n\nThe issue is reporting. Where I live about 4 years ago they stopped prosecuting people who steal less than 500$.  My friend who is a cop said they eventually stopped arresting them because its unethical to arrest someone for a crime they won&#x27;t be prosecuted for.  Then stores stopped calling the cops.  This resulted in more crime but less reported crime for burglary.<p>The only statics you can really count on is Car thefts and murders.  There was a surge in murders in starting in 2020 which has leveled off but it was still high.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;global-metrics&#x2F;countries&#x2F;USA&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;murder-homicide-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;global-metrics&#x2F;countries&#x2F;USA&#x2F;uni...</a><p>The same is true for car thefts<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;191216&#x2F;reported-motor-vehicle-theft-rate-in-the-us-since-1990&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;191216&#x2F;reported-motor-ve...</a><p>I think it reliable to say the US experienced a large surge in crime starting in 2020.\n\n  The issue is the economic and societal problems that drive desperation and widening inequality. It is symptomatic of the short-term thinking and opportunistic nature of an economic model that inherently ignores the implications of its incentives and how their impacts will affect all stakeholders other than investors and their share prices. Let’s not pretend that more incarceration and law enforcement encounters will fix anything, they’re much more likely to further exacerbate the root problem.\n\n    I’d happily pay more in tax to jail every thief in the country.\n\n      Be careful that you yourself or some of your relatives don&#x27;t end up in jail for white collar crime with that approach. You know less about others than you think.\n\n        I think white collar crime should be prosecuted, even if it might æffect me or my relatives. Is that controversial now?\n\n          I was talking more about the misguided approach of &quot;trying to get every last criminal&quot; by being overzealous in policing.<p>Par for the course for HN to misinterpret it, of course.\n\n            Certainly the courts should still exist under this hypothetical.\n\n      How much more would you pay?\n\n    It’s organized gangs that have found a loophole: commit “greasy crimes” at scale where the individual crimes are below a threshold. This is similar to the epidemic of small hit large scale online scams and mail fraud, but in person.<p>It’s a new kind of organized crime enabled by digital technology.\n\n    I&#x27;d make the case your viewpoint is symptomatic of the power of bad ideas. In this case, specifically accepting the idea that individuals do not have responsibility for their own actions or for how they relate to the people around them.\n\n      It also, in a weird way, infantilizes and removes agency from marginalized people. You can in fact be both marginalized and honest, and most marginalized people are.\n\n        And the rich can, in fact, be rich and not steal. Maybe we should put our efforts towards stopping the infantilization of the rich thieves that are responsible for the vast majority of theft in this country? Or are we only gonna clutch our pearls at the petty crime?\n\n          We could also acknowledge two problems simultaneously, without downplaying or minimizing either. That way, neither you nor your imaginary rhetorical opponent is &quot;clutching their pearls&quot;.\n\n      Ridiculous of you to act like this denies their responsibility. When the rich steal millions from the poor daily we should absolutely expect an increase in crime. To blame this solely on the poor is a denial of the responsibility of the rich.\n\n      I mean, can&#x27;t it be both? Individuals have personal agency and are responsible for their own actions. Individuals also respond to incentives which, in aggregate, alter the observed distribution of those individual decisions. The problem can be addressed at both levels.\n\n    You&#x27;re partly correct - people are getting more desparate and hopeless because their prospects are grim, and nihilistic because they feel their lives have no meaning. That&#x27;s a problem and crime will continue to get worse as these feelings  pervade American society.<p>But also, we need to arrest and prosecute criminals, because not doing so encourages crime. It accelerates the downward spiral.\n\n    Sure.  On the other hand, arresting 11 specific people reduced bike theft by 90% in London: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024-02-26&#x2F;a-police-sting-uncovered-130000-worth-of-stolen-bikes-and-cut-thefts-by-90\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024-02-26&#x2F;a-police-sting-uncovered...</a><p>When crime gets to the point where a police tactic as simple as &quot;putting out a bait bicycle, waiting for it to get stolen, and then following it to a warehouse of stolen bicycles&quot; results in a huge reduction of actual crime committed, then maybe the solution isn&#x27;t purely about wealth inequality.\n\n      Sure sure but when it turns out 90% of crime is from 11 people it stops making sense to pass laws punishing all people of a certain class and&#x2F;or giving police incredible amounts of power with little or no oversight.\n\n    Well a lot of the sub-$500 petty theft are done by junkies trying to get their fix for the day, and with opiate addiction getting worse, not better, in the US, there are many of these types and the day-by-day thefts add up over the years. Throwing a repeat offender in jail for a couple weeks is often the only time a junkie will kick, so it kind of does solves the root problem for these individuals. Even some hard-ass jurisdictions have half way houses.<p>Source: me, an ex junkie, and had junkie friends. Go ahead and write this off as an anecdote, but it&#x27;s an anecdote repeated thousands upon thousands of times.\n\n    Most people affected by economic and social problems do not resort to theft to solve their problems. In fact, they are probably far more likely to be a victim - either directly out of sheer proximity or indirectly as stores close and opportunities fade away due to all the theft being allowed in their community.\n\n    We arrested more people for 30 years and crime went down.  There is loads of data that more police in the right places deter crime. All my LEO friends know who that are arresting because they arrest the same people over and over. Crime is driven by a small number of bad actors.\n\n      I remember what ten years ago in San Francisco the cops found a guy shot to death in Bayview. Cops suspicion was he broke into the wrong car and a gang member shot him.<p>Guy had been arrested over a hundred times for breaking into cars in the previous couple of years. So this guy was breaking into several cars a day every day for years and only stopped when someone shot him.<p>I definitely feel that old school habitual criminal laws were over strict and subject to abuse. But not having them at all is also bad.\n\n    Drugs drive theft, not inequality.<p>Anecdotally most of theives I have known of here in New Zealand (Christchurch) are driven by wanting to buy hard drugs.<p>In my experience poorer people here seem to have fairly strict morals against theft.\n\n  Theft is defacto legal in America. It’s too dangerous to prosecute theft; if you do, you could be accused of racial policing, which would cause riots.<p>Better to legalize theft. The police here won’t even respond to car theft other than to help file an insurance claim.\n\n    I don&#x27;t have anything to contribute to the theory, but an anecdote: for a couple weeks last month in NYC, seemingly every street tout had sealed boxes of Apple AirPods sitting on their blankets, next to their fake bags, watches, etc. Other guys were specializing in the trade, standing on street corners holding 2-3 boxes of AirPods, but nothing else.<p>These appeared to be legit products, but obviously stolen. Where did these come from? Why weren&#x27;t the sellers arrested on sight? Is it <i>that hard</i> to know that Apple hasn&#x27;t authorized the corner blanket guy as a reseller? Is possession of stolen goods no longer a crime?<p>I was low-key hoping that the police had some kind of sting running to get the source of the theft, but...who knows?<p>So many questions.\n\n      AirPods fakes are extremely, extremely convincing these days. I would be surprised if they were real stolen products from the Apple Store.\n\n        If so, these were <i>exceptional</i> fakes, down to the quality of the packaging.\n\n          Yup, and you can even buy them for $10-20 off sites like Aliexpress or Temu. They even do the popup for pairing when you open them. The audio quality and ANC is not so great, as far as I know, though.\n\n      Are stolen iPhones even usable with cellular networks?\n\n      &gt; Apple hasn&#x27;t authorized the corner blanket guy as a reseller<p>They are like Apple store geniuses in a more federated architecture.\n\n      The counterfeit&#x2F;replica market for electronics, especially Apple stuff, has gotten really, really good. You often won&#x27;t be able to easily tell just from the sealed box if it is a fake or not -- though opening usually offers some clues because the counterfeits often don&#x27;t have the same attention to detail with the opening tab stickers and whatnot. And the stuff that is often hardest to tell, at least with a cursory glance, are AirPods and AirPods Max headphones.<p>Because I have some friends who don&#x27;t listen to me and insist on buying things from Facebook Marketplace, I&#x27;ve seen some very convincing looking AirPods Max headphones (you can tell they are fake because of markings inside the ear cups amongst other things, they also usually feel lower quality but that&#x27;s hard to judge if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the real things) that will often pair exactly like legit AirPods because the reps have managed to either clone the H1 chip or reverse-engineer the pairing process. The fakes often have real (stolen) serial numbers on the boxes so if you aren&#x27;t familiar with how Apple does their plastic sealing and just ran a serial number off the box to see if it was legit through the Apple serial number checker, you&#x27;d probably think they were legit until you opened them up.<p>At this point, I would guess that at least 90% of the &quot;sold as new&quot; AirPods and AirPods Max on eBay are fakes.<p>This is very different from the old-school world of grey-market cameras sold off of street corners in New York that were often legit but were either fenced and&#x2F;or from foreign markets without official support&#x2F;warranty.<p>The rep handbag game has become incredibly good too, to the point that there is now a subculture of people (some who could even afford the legit offerings) who collect and pay real money for the reps that are largely indistinguishable from the real thing -- but that might cost $800 instead of $18,000.\n\n        &gt; The rep handbag game has become incredibly good too, to the point that there is now a subculture of people (some who could even afford the legit offerings) who collect and pay real money for the reps that are largely indistinguishable from the real thing -- but that might cost $800 instead of $18,000.<p>To add another product category, replica watches are almost  indistinguishable from real watches these days, Rolex are probably the most widely counterfeit watch brand.<p>A good replica sub goes for $1,000 while the real watch is around $10,000<p>Replica watch subreddit: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;RepTime&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;RepTime&#x2F;</a><p>Rolex Submariner Legit vs Replica Video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oYY0bI_Aiqc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oYY0bI_Aiqc</a>\n\n          Yeah...but your average street tout doesn&#x27;t have a $1,000 replica Rolex on a blanket -- they have a $20 Rolox. Also, those fake bags, watches, etc. don&#x27;t have packaging. These &quot;AirPods&quot; came with boxes that were basically exactly like the real thing.<p>Obviously, any New Yorker knows about knockoffs, but these were qualitatively different. They were also prevalent for a week or two, and then seemingly disappeared...as if there was a sudden crackdown or something.\n\n            The fake bags definitely have packaging. Fake documents, fake dust covers, fake Hermes boxes. They go all out in some cases. Usually not for the $30 hand bags sold on the street (though you’d be surprised as to the fake documents some of the Louis Vuitton&#x27;s have inside), but the higher-end reps can be astonishing. A $30 bag masquerading as a $1000+ bag on a street corner isn’t going to have the same accoutrements that a $30 pair of fake AirPods masquerading as a $150 pair will. But a fake $800 bag masquerading as a $18,000 bag will usually come with the goods. Same is true for watches. It’s just the cheapest stuff sold on the street in those categories don’t bother.<p>The fake AirPods box thing I’ve seen for a long time, again, the tell is usually small differences in font&#x2F;printing and how they do the pull tabs. The box fit is often different too, but since most of these are presented sealed, people don’t know.<p>Maybe this really was a ring of fenced goods, who knows. But my guess having seen these things for years is that they were almost certainly a big group of the very common fake AirPods that proliferate eBay and Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp and the like and that are probably incredibly popular in foreign markets where the official products are both more expensive and a greater percentage of GDP.\n\n    Agreed. They have equal right to resources and they are just exercising their rights. By denying snatchers or thieves of iPhones etc one is excluding them from modern information economy.\n\n    Can you give an actual example of this happening? Because it seems all the riots come from needlessly killing people rather than arresting them for stealing.\n\n      People get killed in the process of enforcing laws.  All laws are eventually enforce by violence and that violence kills people. The state house rep who wanted to tax cigarettes didn&#x27;t mean to have Eric Gardner killed but given a large number of police encounters it was bound to happen.<p>The way police responded to 2020 was to pull back because in general its a numbers game.  Given enough encounters bad outcomes will happen.  Pulling back plus the insanity of 2020 caused a rise in crime.  Police are starting to reengage and crime is starting to go down.\n\n        Very weird retelling of the events surrounding Eric Gardner&#x27;s death. The riots weren&#x27;t because cops were arresting him, they weren&#x27;t even surrounding the fact he died. The riots were about the fact that you had 3 cops choking him to death even after they already had him subdued while he repeatedly tried to say he couldn&#x27;t breathe and given the history of cop killings, all 3 were going to walk away with no repercussions.<p>If I write enough code, bugs are going to happen but when bugs happen we have a review and triage the issue, yet when cops kill people suggesting that they need better training or more oversight is suddenly an insane proposal.\n\n          They need tons more training but no one wants to pay for that.  We underfund police compared to other OECD nations. We also have a much more dangerous environment for them to operate in.<p>The individual actions are terrible and every effort should be leveraged to reduce thoes outliers but they will still occur. In 2020 we as a society to put a lot less emphasis on enforcing social order and that causes crime.\n\n            &gt; They need tons more training but no one wants to pay for that.<p>No one agrees on what type of training they need.<p>&gt; We underfund police compared to other OECD nations.<p>This is just not true. The US spends 32 billion dollars on policing[0] while the UK spends 433 million euros[1]. Even if adjusted for PPP that still massively puts the US ahead.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexipol.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023-doj-budget-highlights-enforcement-and-safety-priorities&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexipol.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023-doj-budget-highl...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;police-funding-for-england-and-wales-2015-to-2022&#x2F;police-funding-for-england-and-wales-2015-to-2022\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;police-funding-for-...</a>\n\n              They increased funding by 433 million<p>£15,877 million in police funding for England and Wales has been agreed for the financial year ending March 2022\noverall funding has increased nominally by £433m (2.8%) compared with the previous financial year\n\n                My mistake I read that number wrong. The most recent number I can find is that during the 2022-2023 budget year, the UK spent around 25 billion pounds which puts them closer to the US when compared in USD but still under. Which begs the question, what do you consider well-funded?\n\n                  So per capita the UK spends more than 4x as much?\n\n                    No. The number I quoted is how much the US spends federally on funding the DOJ. It does not include state and local budgets.\n\n                      Its about 190B which is about on par so I was wrong. From my experience with friends who are LEO they get about 1 week of training a year which isn&#x27;t enough.\n\n    &gt; which would cause riots<p>What a thing to just state as fact with confidence, this is like older individuals lamenting how nobody wants to work anymore. It must just feel good to say?\n\n    This might be somewhat true in some costal cities where there was a deliberate policy choice to make petty theft a misdemeanor (and thus encourage more crime), but this is just flat out not true where I live in the south. Theft is still very much prosecuted and not tolerated. I have never seen anyone just walk out with bags of stolen goods here, and our store aisles are not covered in locked plexiglass. Decline is a choice.\n\n      It’s not in coastal cities either, except where the police stopped enforcing the law as a negotiating tactic. For example, in San Francisco note how the work stoppage was focused on getting rid of a DA who threatened to prosecute a police officer who shot an unarmed man:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;today-in-acab-2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;today-in-acab-2&#x2F;</a>\n\n  These charts really show how overblown the murder&#x2F;car theft issues are now. Higher than pre-pandemic yes, but still relatively low.\n\n    Relatively low...meaning slightly lower than 1994, when crime was so high that even black community leaders called for more police, and then Senator Joe Biden wrote &quot;the largest crime bill in the history of the United States&quot; that funded 100,000 more police officers and $10 billion for additional prisons.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_...</a><p>But up 50% from the early 2010s.\n\n      Yes so stop freaking out over relatively low crime. Remember the lessons from that time.\n\n        Lowering Crime was the lesson I took away from it.\n\n          How do you lower crime?\n\n            Reduction in the rate of murders seems like a good metric.\n\n    a 50% rise in murder rate represent thousands of people I don&#x27;t think we should discount it. I also think the rise in theft that people talk about anecdotally effects how people feel about living in cities. The us accepts a very large amount of disorder and that effects the overall trust in the society.<p>Just an FYI.  Crime is awful.  If your poor and your stuff gets stolen that devastating having to pay more to secure you belongings is a real burden. Nothing makes an area poor like crime.  The single most valuable things governments do is law and order the fact that we forgot that in 2020 should be distressing to everyone.\n\n      We didn&#x27;t forget that in 2020. An increase in crime is a pretty normal side effect of a global pandemic. We are lucky that it stayed so tame despite police not doing their jobs because they are pissy about having some accountability.\n\n        The UK did not experience a surge in murders despite also experiencing a pandemic.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;global-metrics&#x2F;countries&#x2F;GBR&#x2F;united-kingdom&#x2F;murder-homicide-rate#:~:text=U.K.%20murder%2Fhomicide%20rate%20for%202020%20was%201.00%2C%20a,2018%20was%201.14%2C%20a%207.19%25%20decline%20from%202017\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;global-metrics&#x2F;countries&#x2F;GBR&#x2F;uni...</a>.\n\n          Neither did Kuwait. Canada, however, did have an increase. Global rates overall did increase.\n\n  &gt;The issue is reporting. Where I live about 4 years ago they stopped prosecuting people who steal less than 500$. My friend who is a cop said they eventually stopped arresting them because its unethical to arrest someone for a crime they won&#x27;t be prosecuted for. Then stores stopped calling the cops. This resulted in more crime but less reported crime for burglary.<p>&quot;The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There&#x27;s something wrong with the way you are measuring it&quot;. —Jeff Bezos &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sports.yahoo.com&#x2F;amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-explains-212315127.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sports.yahoo.com&#x2F;amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-explains-2123...</a>&gt;\n\n    What a convenient way to dismiss all data.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;0VVna\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;0VVna</a>\n\nSo various crime groups are coming together and leveraging the synergies.\n\n  Lots of synergies indeed. And gig workers!\n\n&quot;unload boosted goods at a swap meet, or at a store where illicit items are “washed” by commingling them with legitimate ones.  Pilfered commodities often wind up online.&quot;<p>I do feel like one way to at least prevent resale would be for Target, et. al to work with the manufacturers to put more prominent markings that are custom to their retail outlet (i.e. stickers which signify Target).  That way if I order skincare products or a t-shirt from Amazon and I see that the manufacturer labels have Target on them I can report it to Amazon.<p>I feel like Amazon, eBay, etc. are all key to the increase in the ease of reselling lifted items.\n\n&quot;We&quot; need to stop thinking about &quot;crime&quot; as something negative.<p>It&#x27;s a job, just a job. Some poor hungry person has to do a dangerous job\nso they can feed their family. Simple as.<p>If you are the &quot;victim&quot; of a crime the wise thing to do is not resist, just\nreport the loss to insurance and get compensated, knowing that hungry people\nhave been fed and sheltered for whatever slight inconvenience you have experienced.<p>Perhaps even feel some gratitude that the lucky draw of your birth to privileged\npeople means you don&#x27;t have the job title of criminal?<p>&#x2F;s\n\n  My wife&#x27;s face was smashed in to steal her purse. The people who stole her purse were not hungry.<p>Its not a job and most people who experience crime do not have insurance.  Policing and public safety are our most important social service. Crime destroys people lives and safety. People who commit crime especially violent crime should have their lives destroyed."

In what legal systems does that work?\n\n      I can imagine plenty of cases where this would be reasonable. We would need more details to say if this is a bad outcome.<p>For example, if this was in the US, did the woman plead the fifth, or did she assert to something she knew to be false?

Not by obfuscating on the stand. If an option is to not comment on your innocence under oath, or you&#x27;d be lying if you did that, then don&#x27;t take the stand or remember you don&#x27;t have to admit to a crime. But unless there are provisions against what lies are applicable to perjury I don&#x27;t understand how it wouldn&#x27;t be perjury\n\n            Verdicts of the court are not findings of fact for a start.\n\n      Difference between pleading the fifth and lying.

They could have been scammed for more?<p>He also claims, without any way to know, that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t look like this was made to steal LastPass credentials&quot;.<p>The whole article is very much a &quot;yeah it sucks and shouldn&#x27;t happen, but this is no big deal, really, why are you getting all up in Apple&#x27;s face about it?&quot; vibe.\n\n    Apple introduced Lockdown Mode in 2022 specifically as a measure against Pegasus:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;06&#x2F;apple-spyware-lockdown-pegasus&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;06&#x2F;apple-s...</a>\n\n      But then you would need to assume that you are infected with this malware at a first place.<p>So do you have Lockdown enabled on your iPhone?\n\n        The purpose of Lockdown is for people who (a) have a reasonable chance of being targeted by state actors and (b) if they were would expect significant impact to their wellbeing.<p>For everyone else the existing security controls are more than sufficient.\n\n        You would enable it if you are a high value target that people might hire NSO to go after you like some billionaire or journalist etc.\n\n    When people say Apple products are secure, we’re not saying they’ll stand up to the world’s top hackers, we’re saying when we visit grandpa we won’t find that he’s installed a toolbar in his browser that’s vacuuming up his bank password every time he types it. I know that if one of my relatives installs a sketchy app suggested by a popup, it can’t sit in the background and snoop on them without even being opened. There’s no Cha$e app in the app store pretending to be the official Chase banking app.<p>For sure it’s still possible to “hack” someone who is using Apple products (using social engineering for instance) but entire classes of mischief are off the table because of how Apple locks things down.\n\n  Guys, Apple (and others) have gone too far for too long with the monopolistic practices.<p>This has to stop at some point, this is way too detrimental for the whole software ecosystem. They simply have too much power.<p>The bullshit about the necessity of security warning for non-nerds family members is FUD.\n\n  At minimum, I think iOS should have something similar to the system in macOS which blocks known malware&#x2F;badware.<p>Some kind of local heuristics that can flag suspicious apps and informs the user when something fishy may be afoot may also be good. There are a number of patterns common to malware&#x2F;scamware that an ML model should have little trouble picking up on — weird domains, convoluted URLs, recognizable brand mimicry, etc.\n\n  This was on HN a week ago:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39685272\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39685272</a><p>Certainly sounds like massive and systemic security problems in the App Store. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worse or better than on Android though.\n\n  &gt; i believe the security warnings are a good thing and should not be outlawed.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. They&#x27;re only warning on non-App Store apps, which to me is also problematic, because it creates a <i>perception</i> of security on the App Store which isn&#x27;t actually real. LassPass, anyone?<p>Apple can allow actual turds like that on the App Store without a security warning, but the most inspected&#x2F;reviewed app on an external store is getting a &quot;downloading this app may be risky&quot;.\n\n  It&#x27;s a bit like the EU thinking that by forcing websites to surface their advertising partners&#x2F;personal data practices it will encourage people to visit less privacy-invasive websites, when instead it&#x27;s now rare to find a website that doesn&#x27;t have the privacy click-through, making the web that little bit more tedious. Amusingly EU&#x27;s favourite children epicgames.com and spotify.com have to show these pop-ups due to their data collection practices while &quot;evil&quot; apple doesn&#x27;t have to show these pop-ups because they&#x27;re not abusing visitor data.<p>As for 3rd party app stores: Despite the EU&#x27;s head-in-the-sand approach, I do expect that 3rd party stores will abuse direct access to customers to use dark patterns to exploit additional unwanted purchases, stymie refunds and make it difficult to unsubscribe. Why? Because this is what businesses such as Epic Games, New York Times and Spotify already do with their direct customers. It doesn&#x27;t have to be malware to be a scam. People cheering for Epic Games seem to forget that just over a year ago Epic Games settled with the FTC for over half a billion dollars in fines for abusing their customers with predatory practices and invading the privacy of children(1).<p>Side note: It&#x27;s also rather sickening to see EU&#x27;s DMA regulators such as Thierry Breton(2) using the marketing hashtag #freefortnite on their tweets. What a perfect demonstration of their lack of neutrality and promoting a company found to exploit its users. They clearly are not working in the interest of consumer protection, that&#x27;s just a red herring for protectionism.<p>(1) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;fortnite-video-game-maker-epic-games-pay-more-half-billion-dollars-over-ftc-allegations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;...</a><p>(2) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;ThierryBreton&#x2F;status&#x2F;1766167580497117464\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;ThierryBreton&#x2F;status&#x2F;1766167580497117464</a>\n\n    I always decline the tracking from the websites so the EU laws had an effect giving me the option to decline.<p>At my work we also did updates , for example purging the user data when they close their account.<p>See changes happened, too bad that most websites decided to make the popups  super evil and try to make it hard to decline, EU did not ask the websites to implement them like that, some other evil capitalists decided that screwing humans for a few dollars is worth it.\n\n      I see this as a failure of the legislation and entirely foreseeable. That’s why I blame the EU because “evil capitalists” existed back then too.<p>I use that example because if the EU wanted to encourage websites to not abuse user data, their legislation didn’t mandate that and the result we have today was entirely expected. Instead they should have legislated for that consumer protection directly.<p>My point here is that the EU acted naively when they wrote that legislation and I see a repeat of this unwillingness to truly address the problem with the DMA - currently EU politicians are promoting the potential fringe benefits of the DMA while ignoring the much larger, much more probable consumer harms. Noting the FTC fine against Epic Games and Fortnite, certain EU politicians are even promoting one of those “evil capitalists”.<p>It is plainly foreseeable how the DMA will directly hinder small developers and harm consumers, the only true winner from the DMA are large developers of well known software such as Microsoft and Spotify, whereby the DMA significantly tilts balance in their favour.\n\n        GDPR is not about websites or internet, it applies for everything, so the law should not dictate an UX.  Be patient , slowly this popups will be declared illegal by the justice system , companies will pay the fines and will fix them.<p>I think the IT &#x2F; tech people need to  decide on sme standards here and not have EU force one on them.  There are some laws about age verification, this shit could have been solved by tech decades ago where you set the user age in the computer&#x2F;phone OS when you create the account then the OS and browsers work together to ensure under 18 do not access adult websites or apps.  Then concerned parents when buy a phone for the children and they setup their email&#x2F;account they just enter the birthday and the OS&#x2F;browser will have to do the work to filter the content.<p>But the tech crowd was busy with other shit and conservatives&#x2F;religious types will force us all to suffer the consequences and prove Google&#x2F;Steam&#x2F;YouTube ... my age\n\n          &gt; Be patient..<p>It doesn&#x27;t affect me on a personal level so it&#x27;s not a discussion about idealism and having patience.<p>What I&#x27;m describing is a symptom of failed and naive legislation. It&#x27;s also an exceedingly slow legislature; the GDPR was finished in 2016 and implemented in 2018. Whatever the EU plans for it, it&#x27;s already done. You don&#x27;t need patience, you need acceptance.<p>Per your comment: An often heard theme is that commercial entities should get ahead of the EU&#x2F;other governmemts to stave off GDPR-like legislation. However this is not just naive to commercial operations, but also to politics:<p>Once a government makes clear their intention to regulate a practice, businesses scale back their own plans to self-regulate, for the very simple reason that any solutions they would devise are now out of their hands. Whatever changes they implement would only be chance to align with the government&#x27;s mandate. When we compare privacy protections invented by Apple versus those mandated by the GDPR we see extremely different approaches to the same problem, and Facebook&#x27;s financials show that Apple&#x27;s technological approaches have been far more effective, while also not projecting certain &quot;protectionist&quot; themes that are a recurring aspect of EU legislation (i.e. the politics side of introducing protectionism policies and mass surveillance while crying &quot;won&#x27;t somebody think of the consumers&#x2F;children&quot;.)<p>A final issue that I&#x27;ll simply allude to is that many comments on HN are not just poorly researched, but absent knowledge of even recent events. Head in the clouds kind of stuff. Malware isn&#x27;t hypothetical. Data collection corps such as Facebook and Google using side-loading to subvert OS-level protections&#x2F;review processes isn&#x27;t FUD, it&#x27;s already happened.\n\nAre there any examples of other companies failing to follow the DMA &#x2F; complying maliciously or is it only Apple right now?\n\n  Meta was mentioned also <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;eus-vestager-warns-about-apple-meta-fees-disparaging-rival-products-2024-03-19&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;eus-vestager-warns-about-...</a>\n\n  Google also shows a screen warning users about the risks of side-loading.<p>And it&#x27;s been the standard on the desktop for years e.g. OSX and Windows warn about non-notarised apps."

      "conversation_text": "Author Bren Smith recommends this in his book Eat Like a Fish. He also recommends eating seaweed and mollusks, and that the water of the eastern seaboard may have been mostly clear due to all the filter-feeders.<p>My general recommendation is to treat meat like a luxurious delicacy and to instead rely on sprouted seeds (legumes, nuts) and other plant parts for protein, until human population and customs can scale back to a point where the carrying capacity of the land and sea can support not only us but so much other life we share the planet with. Strength and resilience through diversity of species. I&#x27;m willing to give up a lot of luxuries for this.\nAt the end of the day it&#x27;s nice to settle down in a shelter with loved ones, all having eaten enough.\n\n  I always read general recommendation for diets as conditioned under the culture for which the author lives in. Without the cultural aspect, it always sound like telling people in rice eating cultures that they should all shift to wheat because of lower methane emissions (or asking wheat eating cultures to switch to rice because of lower CO2 emissions, both arguments has a point).<p>I do want to see a cultural change towards seaweed and mollusks on a global scale. Nutrition rich runoff from farms create a lot of damage in oceans, lakes and rivers, and both seaweed and mollusks are great in picking up that excess nutrition. I would also like to see a change towards consuming overpopulated fish. It is a completely cultural phenomenon that we can have both overfishing and fish overpopulations at the same time (usually not the same type of fish).<p>I would also like to see a return towards using domesticated animals in order to replace combustion. Waste food should be prioritized towards animal feed rather than bio gas. Household animals used to be a common practice, and it allowed people to eat meat with much smaller footprint. Chickens are also excellent lawnmowers that do not operate on fossil fuels.\n\n  Agreed most countries don’t appreciate meat like Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. If everyone lived like us the planet would be a lot more healthy and enjoyable.<p>Ideally Europe would stop farming and restore its forests to an equal percentage of the land as Brazil. Sadly Europe has ignored the environment for millennia and is unwilling to change its ways.\n\n  &gt; sprouted seeds (legumes, nuts) and other plant parts for protein<p>Doing so will drive demand for better diabetes treatments. Managing diabetes is a longer and more nuanced conversation than one can have here. The rule of thumb is that all carbohydrates harm blood glucose control. The best diet is based on your body type. For me (and many others), a low-carb, inulin-rich diet (unprocessed meats, low-starch vegetables) seems to give lower blood glucose increases.<p>Some claim a low-fat vegan diet will put diabetes into remission, and I&#x27;m sure it does for some body types. I can not judge the validity of that claim except that I do not have that body type, and it made my diabetes control significantly worse.\n\n    &gt; The rule of thumb is that all carbohydrates harm blood glucose control.<p>This is untrue. Only simple carbohydrates harm blood glucose control. Complex carbs such as whole grains and fruit aid in it, in part thanks to their fiber. If you have a source that supports your claim, please share it, it must be bleeding edge nutritional science.\n\n      I&#x27;ve not seen any research showing that whole-grain carbohydrates have a lower impact on blood glucose than quick carbohydrates. We have only proof by repeated assertion.<p>My freestyle Libra CGM has recorded the impact of whole-grain products on my body. Whole-grain products consistently spike my blood sugar. 40 g of oatmeal or Bob&#x27;s Red Mill 10-grain mix will push me up to 100-120 milligrams per deciliter. Whole-wheat pasta, 60g, will push me up about 150-200 mg&#x2F;dL.<p>Eating more than 25 g carbs per meal pushes me up beyond 50 mg&#x2F;dL at the one-hour mark. If I consistently let my blood sugar climb between 75 and 100 mg&#x2F;dL at the one-hour mark, my fasting blood sugar starts to climb. This is how I learned that low-fat vegan was a bad diet for me. My A1c went from 6 to 7.8 in less than a year.<p>Too much dietary advice for diabetics is, at best, mythology.\n\nFishing in the wild without restocking the fish population is simply a form of poaching.\n\n  I&#x27;m pretty sure wild fish restock themselves by reproducing, it&#x27;s more about finding the equilibrium it converges to and not overfishing.\n\n    In Vietnam, marine wildlife sanctuaries help enormously. Fisherman are banned from fishing in certain areas, but can fish with great success <i>around</i> those areas. The protected areas allow stock to be replenished. It’s the goose that laid the golden egg phenomenon.\n\n  Restocking could have the same effect as replanting trees: numbers stay the same so it absolves the industry.<p>But the ecosystem is still getting worse as it gets devastated by the constant churn and artificially restored new areas are not as diverse as the original one.\n\nOne should just stop eating fish as far as possible. Between all the worlds ocean ecosystems being in trouble and the risk of ingesting heavy metals it is just not worth it.\n\n  There&#x27;s a geopolitical issue regarding countries with ample farm land and islands for instance with moatly sea resources though.\n\nYes...but hunting&#x2F;eating further up the food chain is a timeless way to demonstrate that you are further up the human social pyramid.  Similar for more heavily processed &amp; elaborately prepared foods.\n\n  It&#x27;s not demonstrative - food from higher up the pyramid is actually denser in nutrients and taste vastly better in my mind (we&#x27;re talking beef vs lentils, not plankton vs lion).\n\n    ... But if they are higher up the food chain they also accumulate far, far higher levels of heavy metals. This is true for meats and fish.\n\n      True, and I vaguely recall a case or few where people showed off their rich tastes (for swordfish steaks, etc.) until their nerves &amp; muscles didn&#x27;t particularly work together.<p>But, back during the formative millennia of human nature, that wasn&#x27;t a problem.\n\n    Plenty of counterexamples. I think scallops are probably the best tasting seafood if not one of the best tasting foods period and they&#x27;re filter feeders. Shrimp is pretty good as well. Meanwhile, bear tastes pretty bad.\n\n      I quite like bear - tastes like a beefier beef. Depends on what the bear ate.\n\n    <i>Statistically</i> true.  But are herring, pigeons, and rabbits meaningfully less nutrition-dense than large&#x2F;dangerous&#x2F;brag-worthy game?\n\nFish fed to farmed salmon should be part of our diet, too, study suggests<p>is the actual title\n\n  And &quot;leads to loss of nutrients&quot; definitely makes it sound like &quot;this is leeching nutrients from your body&quot;, not &quot;there isn&#x27;t a 100% transfer of nutrients from feeder fish to salmon to you&quot;\n\nBig salmon (I say that in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek way) seems to have a chokehold on all food suppliers. I swear salmon makes up 90% of the fish I see sold almost anywhere apart from a specialised fishmonger. I find it really wierd\n\n  Salmon is tasty\n\n  It&#x27;s because almost all other fish tastes kinda bad except for trout, which is basically salmon. This is the market catering properly to the buyers.\n\n    Have you tried fresh halibut? I don&#x27;t like fish generally, including salmon, but actual Alaskan halibut (not flounder deliberately mislabeled as halibut) is quite tasty, to me.\n\n    This is such a narrow-minded view. The reason you think that is because you&#x27;re from a country that lacks fish culture, where very few fish dishes are served. In Japan or Italy, they eat every single type of sea creature that could possibly exist and they eat them fresh and its a big part of their culture. In japan, there is sushi of every single sea creature that can possibly be eaten. Salmon is one option. So your view that salmon is the only good fish is completely cultural.<p>I&#x27;m from the UK and despite being an island we have no fish culture. We used to have more, but the supermarkets that have a total chokehold on our food lives have severely limited the variety (and freshness) of fish available, making us squeamish about foods that were an integral part of our culture (eels, cockles, smoked fishes of many kinds). This is a horrible horrible loss to the diversity of our diets and to the populations of the few fish people still eat (cod and salmon).<p>The lack of fish culture that makes you state such an opinion is most likely caused by unsustainable, monopolistic supply chains that have shaped culture, it is not an objective fact.<p>Luckily, I have carribean heritage and a degree in Japanese and so I have exposure to good fish from other cultures. You know, people make fun of the fact that the British used to eat eels, but in Japan, eel is seen as the most premium, most delicious food you could possibly eat? It&#x27;s more expensive than steak to eat at a restaurant, it&#x27;s so sought after. Salmon doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to eel.\n\n    I find it hard to believe you genuinely think almost all fish tastes bad. At the very least, you understand this is an idiosyncratic view, right?<p>I cannot imagine this being a common view unless you just haven&#x27;t tried many fish varieties\n\n    People in the replies sure seem to have a hard time accepting that markets aren&#x27;t personal. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you think tastes good. What matters is that buyers where this observation is being made think that salmon and trout taste good and that other fish do not. This is a very common situation in the US. You don&#x27;t need to be offended by it or talk aggro-defensively about how your fish culture is superior to someone else&#x27;s. The rise of salmon consumption isn&#x27;t a conspiracy. It&#x27;s just a flavor profile that agrees with the masses.\n\n      Did you read my reply. You are objectively wrong and I explained now. Your fish culture is caused by the industrialisation of food, which is what makes you think only salmon is good. Your point would only be valid if salmon was universally nicer to everyone. Like salmon is some inevitable singularity of fish consumption.\n\nSardines are awesome, they make boneless skinless fillet now which substitute well for tuna (I seem to always get a bone stuck in a tooth so prefer no bones despite being tasty).<p>That said, sushi from sardines seems dicey.\n\nAbout their recommendation: one thing I never understood was, how can we at the same time say we are overfishing and that people should eat more wild fish?\n\n  Not all fish are overfished. Even salmon isn&#x27;t overfished in all regions.\n\n  It&#x27;s been a while since I read &quot;The Perfect Protein&quot; by Andy Sharpless, but IIRC their argument is that it&#x27;s not just fish, but particular populations of fish. Some wild fish are fine to eat - others are either at risk or are keystone species that shouldn&#x27;t be wiped out. Also the method of fishing makes a difference as well. Hence the contrasting advice.\n\n    Those are good points. I guess it&#x27;s still possible to tilt things in the wrong direction, but we can always adjust.\n\n  They&#x27;re giving advice based on that&#x27;s good for the individual,  which can be at odds with what&#x27;s good for the collective.\n\n  We can&#x27;t. The fishing fleets are on a path to totally wiping out Herring in the Baltic Sea for example. So the article misses the point on that front too. The government of Sweden is doing nothing while the population collapses.\n\n  I wonder if anchovy and mackerels are overfished. I&#x27;m not sure as we don&#x27;t see them often on the table and there&#x27;s few reports outside of California.<p>In this specific case, even if they wouldn&#x27;t be the best food source in general, they would still be better than salmons (which we eat plenty of) in terms of food efficiency.<p>This notion of shortcuting the production cycle is really intersting to me. If for instance instead of drinking milk we&#x27;d get equivalent nutriments from straight eating grass based products, that would open a lot of ways for improvement.\n\n    I don&#x27;t know about nutrition and overfishing, but mackerel are incredibly tasty to me.\n\nIt&#x27;s the same story on the land. It&#x27;s healthier and better for the environment eat lower down the food chain.<p>A science-based book on the topic is How Not to Die by Dr. Michael Greger, which review nutrition studies related to a range of terminal diseases. Primarily plant-based diets come out as being best for longevity.<p>Folks who study longevity specifically reached the same conclusion that a 95% to 100% plant-based diet was good for longevity.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bluezones.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;food-guidelines&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bluezones.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;food-guidelines&#x2F;</a>\n\nFor ~200k years, humans got food from hunting and gathering. You went out in nature and caught the food you could find growing wild there. That supported a global population of ~50M.<p>10k years ago we started figuring out how top make food ourselves (farming), and now we can comfortably feed 7000M.<p>But we still harvest the oceans like hunters and gatherers. I don&#x27;t think this can or should go on. We need to farm the oceans!\n\n  Yes, much of the ocean is basically a desert due to a lack of iron. Low iron leads to low plankton which leads to low fish counts.<p>Ocean fertilization could 10x the number of fish, and possibly store some carbon also.\n\n  See my comment above. Marine wildlife sanctuaries are very effective at replenishing stock.<p>Also, it’s not always realistic to farm fish. It’s not always possible. And the quality is often much worse given farming practices.\n\n    &gt; <i>Also, it’s not always realistic to farm fish. It’s not always possible.</i><p>That&#x27;s completely true with current technology. I&#x27;m talking about the long term future.<p>It took 10k of farming before fertilizers were invented in 1913 and doubled food production.\n\nis this a joke? yes, there is obviously a loss of energy and material as waste when go a step, just like in real ecological networks where one animal eating another does not absorb everything its body has to offer for nutrients\n\n  It&#x27;s not a joke, because people continue to eat inefficiently higher up on the food chain.\n\n    We aren&#x27;t so starved so as to have to prioritize eating efficiently, people will eagerly prioritize aspects of taste and eat inefficiently, and it&#x27;s <i>great</i> that they can do that - it would be horrific and a symptom of unacceptable overpopulation if people couldn&#x27;t afford to eat &quot;inefficiently&quot; and would have to resort at eating whatever as long as it has sufficient nutrients.\n\n      Animal agriculture is a major driver of climate change, so we are already at the point where food choices made a significant difference.<p>Thankfully, there are plenty of great tasting plant-based foods.\n\n        i’ll take my farmed salmon and you can eat what you want, including the bony and not very tasty feed fish if you so desire\n\n        I’d be willing to eat more meat to reduce the population of carbon producing animals.\n\nOverall, this suggests that farmed salmon loses some nutrients compared to the wild fish it eats and that we&#x27;re better off eating a more varied diet of the wild fish species that are fed to farmed salmon, such as sardines, mackerel, and anchovies.\n\nIn East Asian cuisine, such as Japanese dishes, mackerel is a common ingredient. Grilled mackerel is delicious. Generally speaking, salmon is a fish with relatively low mercury content, much lower than that of tuna, making it a healthy choice among seafood."

Use dark patterns to make withholding consent inconvenient or impossible<p>2. Compensate users for the use of their data (e.g. giving discounts or providing free products in exchange for giving up your privacy)<p>Obviously many companies would rather do #1 if they can. #2 is the Google approach and also the “put this OBD2 dongle in your car for cheaper insurance” model. But its even more profitable for an insurance company if they can avoid giving discounts to the smallish subset of good drivers who consent to being tracked, and just price all “reckless” drivers higher (because then the good drivers who still don’t want to be tracked aren’t compelled to switch insurers to get a good price). Of course, in this scenario the insurance company doesn’t need to care about the good driver whose rates unfairly go up because of a rarely triggered software bug that mischaracterizes his driving, so long as on average the classifier is mostly accurate.<p>My point here is that any effort to just make consent “more transparent to the consumer” is fruitless, because when users are actually given the choice, like the iOS dialog to allow Facebook to track you, they overwhelmingly won’t give consent unless there’s something in it for them. So automakers will probably just make the TOS checkbox consent slightly more onerous and annoying, to appease regulators, and it will end up like cookie banners.\n\n  We really need legislation in the US to regulate the use of data... something like the GDPR with enforcement for people who are careless with their customers.<p>As well as strongly regulating sales of data&#x2F;data brokers, of course.\n\n    Honestly, something as simple as statutory damages would be enough.

To me privacy should be a right, and not a premium tier.\n\n    What if I&#x27;m willing to forgo my privacy in exchange for money? There&#x27;s no real difference between saving $10 and getting paid $10, so &quot;privacy should be a right, and not a premium tier&quot; is fundamentally incompatible with &quot;people should be allowed to voluntarily sell their data&quot;.\n\n      The law also prevents you from giving up your freedom for money; a contract like &quot;I accept to be the indentured servant of $CORPORATION in exchange for $50k&quot; is void. Similarly it should prevent you from giving up your privacy like that.\n\n&quot;Consent” will immediately turn into “click I Agree before the car will let you drive it at all”. How about just don’t spy on me?\n\nNobody would ever give informed consent to the sort of data collection we’re experiencing. You can just skip the consent part and suggest we need to create a real privacy law."

I really don&#x27;t understand why they haven&#x27;t pulled down this one.\n\n  Presumably because they seem to believe the latest warnings to be enough, and that the number of real affected users to be low enough to not outweigh the security benefits.<p>I myself, for example, have had zero issues with this release.

My game crashes as I try to enter the world most of the time.

I’m having a problem where my macbook will dark wake (even though I have turned absolutely everything off that allows it to dark wake). Wouldn’t be that big of an issue, except that it will dark wake, then get stuck in dark wake with the lid closed while sitting in my bag, eventually running the battery down and overheating the laptop. This is a known issue. It’s been a known issue for years. Nothing has changed. On my recent call with their “advanced technical support”, I screen-shared with the technician, showing her all the logs where the computer woke up while in my bag, got stuck endlessly scanning the network, experienced a thermal emergency, etc. Her response: “can you take a screenshot of the issue the next time it happens? Maybe take a screenshot of your computer being awake when it shouldn’t be? We can’t continue until you update to 14.4 and you provide a screenshot of the issue.”\n\n  This very issue has been bugging me for years on different MBP models. I dread contacting support for getting a similar treatment.\n\n  Does your bag have magnets in it?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;peakdesign&#x2F;comments&#x2F;nkb6t2&#x2F;laptop_waking&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;peakdesign&#x2F;comments&#x2F;nkb6t2&#x2F;laptop_w...</a>\n\n    It has a couple of very low strength ones.

      "conversation_text": "I love the first book; have read it ~5 times. I never picked up on this &quot;heroes are disasters&quot; theme until last week, when a review of the movie said the same thing. Still love the book, not sure if it was that effective at getting that message across. Maybe my opinion will change when I re-read it again with knowledge of that underlying motivation.\n\n  Herbert himself regretted the fact that not many people picked up on that theme, which is why they tried to make it more obvious in the movie.<p>Did you read Dune Messiah and Children of Dune?\n\n    Makes sense, thanks for the color. That makes me give Part Two a little more slack. But only a little. Loved Part One but Part Two was a disappointment for me.<p>Yes, read each of those books once. I think I got up to God Emperor. Next time I have the itch to read the first, maybe I&#x27;ll just force myself all the way through to Chapterhouse...\n\n  I don’t think it’s even possible to read that theme out of book 1; the only real suggestion of it is the jihad prophecy, but by the end of the book our hero has only really done good things for good people and has dramatically escalated in power over his enemies with essentially zero negative consequences… and even as you read through it, it seems like Paul is going to eventually avoid that future (because he’s so constantly aware of heading towards it), so even thats not useful. It only really shows up in the next books, and then with hindsight\n\n  It wasn&#x27;t obvious to me until I read God-Emperor. God-Emperor is the key to understanding exactly what Dune is about. These days when I re-read all six books (as I do maybe every five years or so), the original trilogy just ends up feeling like prequels.\n\n&gt; but my superhero concept filled me with a concern that ecology might be the next banner for demagogues and would-be-heroes, for the power seekers and others ready to find an adrenaline high in the launching of a new crusade.<p>Damn, he was spot on about this.\n\n  That was a big surprise for me. I always took the book as an earnest ecological message. Totally missed the &quot;heroes are disasters&quot; central theme and therefore the underlying warning about greenwashing.\n\n&gt; The scarce water of Dune is an exact analog of oil scarcity. CHOAM is OPEC.<p>I didn&#x27;t realize that was the official line. I always thought spice was supposed to be a metaphor for oil rather than water. Especially since spice was only found on a single desert planet but the heroes came from a world covered with water. If water was supposed to represent oil and the heroes had any sense of basic economics, they would have just shipped tonnes of water from their homeworld. Or have gotten water from stellar ice or hydrogen.<p>One of the positive pro-technologies messages from the Dune series is that the spice monopoly is broken once synthetic spice is created. I viewed this as an optimistic future where synthetic carbon-negative hydrocarbons (or solar, wind, fusion, etc) would replace our dependency on oil pulled from the ground.\n\n  Yeah, always wondered what&#x27;s the upper limit on a Heighliner - load one up with water. There seems to be plenty of energy available for transfer to&#x2F;from LEO.\n\n&quot;power structures tend to attract people who want power for the sake of power and that a significant proportion of such people are imbalanced-in a word, insane.&quot;<p>Years ago I read someone who was paraphrasing this and use it to describe how governments go bad. I did not realize that Herbert originated it (afaik)\n\n  Can’t remember where I heard it but “people who desire public office should be utterly barred from it”.<p>Very few are able to escape their own prejudices, viewpoints and succeed in the office. Extremely difficult to make a positive difference for everyone. So many recent examples.\n\n    SO, a system like jury selection.\n\n      Imagine a political system that was filled with randomly selected people rather than those motivated by power.\nIt could work. Since anyone can do the job of a politician imo... it&#x27;s not like medicine or engineering that requires hard skills. :laugh:\n\n        You&#x27;d still need a filter. An attention span and an appetite for institutional processes.\n\n          Sounds like a job for a machiavellian mentat with aspergers and delusions of grandeur.\n\nI&#x27;ve read the first book twice over the years, and really liked it. I&#x27;ve read the second book too, but I don&#x27;t remember much about that one.<p>How many of the books would you recommend reading to get the whole story? I&#x27;ve heard they go off the rails later on (or was that the Ender saga?).\n\n  Read through book 4, <i>God Emperor of Dune</i>. At that point, “rails” are a distant memory. It’s wild, it’s wooly, it’s a 3 thousand year old worm king writing in his diary.<p>Book 2 is grim and deflating, 3 picks up the pace again but is really just setup for 4.<p>After 4, Herbert’s wife passes away and he takes up with his much younger editor. From then on, the books get <i>significantly</i> hornier. YMMV.\n\n    Agree that 4 is the fulcrum. If anyone stops at 2 or 3 they are doing themselves a disservice.<p>I never realized that the change in tone in 5 and 6 were due to a new editor. Interesting, but it makes sense.<p>I think 5 and 6 were ... fine. But I have trouble pinpointing what they were really about. There is a lot of movement but no direction.\n\n      Oh yeah, 5 and 6 are… different. To be clear, by “takes up with” his editor I mean they had an affair.<p>I hesitate to use the word because afaik Herbert was a widower at the time, but can’t think of a better one that hits the right tone.\n\n        Affair is the wrong word:<p>Affair: a sexual relationship between two people, one or both of whom are married to or in a long-term relationship with someone else.\n&quot;his wife is having an affair&quot;. (Google)\n\n          If you’re going to be pedantic, at least be correct:<p>Websters: “a romantic or passionate attachment typically of limited duration”\n\n  Do read <i>Dune Messiah</i>, the sequel to <i>Dune</i>.  I believe it was written specifically for those who failed to get the negative implication from <i>Dune</i>.  Hence, it was not so well received.  It is my favourite in the series (well, maybe after <i>Dune</i> itself), firstly because it is very explicit about the tragic consequences of Paul&#x27;s jihad, which was only hinted at in the first book, and secondly because of the way that it greatly enriches the literary universe of Dune by filling more details of the various political actors, the Guild steersmen, the amoral technologists of the Bene Tleilax, gholas, the mysterious planet Ix, and so on.  And the <i>Dune Messiah</i> is surprisingly short!<p>You should probably read <i>Children of Dune</i> to round off the trilogy, just to learn the fate of Paul Atreides, although he is not the primary character in that book.<p>The second trilogy is distinct but the stories are told told in the same setting; enjoyable but not essential.\n\n    I will, thanks. I was planning to read book 4 as well, since people are saying that&#x27;s the best one, can I stop there? Or will I have too many unanswered questions?\n\nTim O&#x27;Reilly, of the famous publishers, interviewed and later befriended Herbert while writing his 1981 book on the author, <i>Frank Herbert</i>. It covers a lot of the themes of the linked essay in an effort to explore the origin and meaning of the Dune trilogy, as it was then.<p>The book is freely available on oreilly.com[1] and likely worth a look for anyone interested in TFA.<p>For example, O&#x27;Reilly claims &quot;in writing about the mystique of the superhero, Herbert himself was prey to it&quot; quoting Analog editor John Campbell&#x27;s rejection letter for Dune Messiah: &quot;science-fictioneers [...] want heroes—not anti-heroes. They want stories of strong men who exert themselves, inspire others, and make a monkey&#x27;s uncle out of malign fates! As Paul did in <i>Dune</i> —not as he fails completely to do in <i>The Messiah</i>&quot;<p>Campbell misses the point, O&#x27;Reilly says, &quot; that Herbert deliberately looked for this reaction from his readers. To Herbert, the hero mystique is symptomatic of a deadly pathology in contemporary society, a compulsive yearning for easy answers. As long as men are looking for simple solutions to their problems, they will give over their ability to think for themselves to the first person who comes along and promises a solution. The Dune trilogy is an attempt to unveil that pattern and, in some small part, to change it.&quot;[2]<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;tim&#x2F;herbert&#x2F;index.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;tim&#x2F;herbert&#x2F;index.csp</a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;tim&#x2F;herbert&#x2F;ch09.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;tim&#x2F;herbert&#x2F;ch09.html</a>\n\n&quot;I now believe that evolution, or de-evolution, never ends short of death, that no society has ever achieved an absolute pinnacle, that all humans are not created equal. In fact, I believe attempts to create some abstract equalization create a morass of injustices that rebound on the equalizers. Equal justice and equal opportunity are ideals we should seek, but we should recognize that humans administer the ideals and that humans do not have equal ability.&quot;<p>I feel like we&#x27;ve been seeing exactly this in contemporary political movements. Identify some perceived injustice with society, create a power structure to address it, more injustice is created in the process, festering resentment at the power structure develops and produces blowback."

      "conversation_text": "This is big, because Rust and Debian have a philosophical disagreement how software should be updated, and so far this has left Debian users with a Rust package that is not supported by a significant portion of the Rust ecosystem.<p>Rust has an &quot;evergreen&quot; approach to updates, like Chrome, focusing on making updates so easy and backwards-compatible that there&#x27;s nothing stopping users from always using the latest version. Debian prefers quite the opposite, and they&#x27;d rather keep outdated software with known bugs than to risk updating and bringing new bugs.<p>Having rustup-init is a compromise, allowing Debian users to have an up-to-date non-Debian Rust version, without `curl | sh`.\n\n  Rusts extremely heavy bias towards statically compiled binaries is also a notable major major major cross-roads here. The rust&#x2F; tree in Debian is big and heavy, tons of stuff. But unlike the entire rest of Debian it&#x27;s entirely &amp; purely -dev packages. Because Rust truly has zero interest in participating in conventional well managed shared library systems. I-caches &amp; broad system updating be dammed: recompile &amp; reduplicate the world, I guess, if you believe rust.<p>Very very very interested to see what happens with this fanaticism as it faces it&#x27;s new challenge, WASI. I can think of no language less competent &amp; less disposed to WASI librarification than Rust.\n\n    The shared vs static libs divide has been ongoing since libraries were a thing. Not an OS maintainer&#x2F;packager, but from the outside, it really seems most of Debian&#x27;s headaches are because they want to maximize compatibility owing to shared libraries.<p>Which is an entirely valid approach, but it seems like things would be a lot easier if programs were all statically compiled.\n\n    Rust is not the single language implementation that wants to avoid the &quot;conventional&quot; shared library systems. Python did so, Node did so and probably many other did or plan to do so. The conventional systems are most suitable for end-user applications, while they are annoying at the best for many other use cases.\n\n      &gt; Python did so<p>Nah, python is one of the few languages with an ecosystem that can still be properly packaged, even after pep517. All libraries are scripts that are installed (and bytecode-compiled) globally.<p>Node is a pain in the ass due to the granularity of libraries, how frequently they update and how developers expect a specific pinned version (and vendors are flaky about backwards-compat), but nothing stopping it from having the same treatment as python.<p>Dynamic linking isn&#x27;t really an end-user feature, but rather a system integrator&#x27;s. It makes it easier to make sure everything behaves the same, and can share the same resources, which is why Apple particularly wanted an ABI for Swift[1]<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faultlore.com&#x2F;blah&#x2F;swift-abi&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faultlore.com&#x2F;blah&#x2F;swift-abi&#x2F;</a> - How Swift Achieved Dynamic Linking Where Rust Couldn&#x27;t\n\n        &gt; Nah, python is one of the few languages with an ecosystem that can still be properly packaged, even after pep517. All libraries are scripts that are installed (and bytecode-compiled) globally.<p>Virtually every Python programmer now uses some sort of virtual environments, because a single Python environment cannot have multiple versions of the same package installed, and those &quot;proper&quot; packages are pain in the ass for that reason. If I install a `python3-pil` package in Ubuntu jammy today, it will be 9.0.1 instead of 10.2.0 and I cannot install 10.2.0 into the global environment without risking some breakage. Yes, there would be some backport packages and then PPAs, but they will again be non-cooperative in the same way and I just want to use `pip`.<p>What if each leaf package making use of `python3-pil` had their own virtual environment instead? That would solve most problems, but doesn&#x27;t that sound like rustup? In fact, `dist-packages` was born exactly due to the stubbornness of those distro packages...<p>&gt; Dynamic linking isn&#x27;t really an end-user feature, but rather a system integrator&#x27;s.<p>Any system integrator that strictly insists on dynamic linking is missing the whole point of building systems in the first place.\n\n          My point was that it does both. It didn&#x27;t ditch dynamic system libraries, and it&#x27;s better off for it than the rest of &#x27;em.<p>The fun thing about the python ecosystem, is that even if you write an application for the latest version of Pillow, its API is stable, and you&#x27;re unlikely to actually use anything introduced only in the newest version, so switching between versions is largely free (though you should definitely specify a minimum version reflecting the functionalities you actually use). In the worst case, the distro will eventually catch up with the library version your software needs, and then it can be packaged. Unlike with the node ecosystem, in python land code can easily survive years without upstream maintenance!<p>&gt; Any system integrator that strictly insists on dynamic linking is missing the whole point of building systems in the first place.<p>You can&#x27;t really say things like this without elaborating.\n\n      A couple of weeks ago I was curious how many binaries on my system did not link glibc. On my pretty standard Unbuntu it were exactly ten and they were 100% Go binaries.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think rust is &#x27;fanatic&#x27; about it, there&#x27;s no cultural or organisational push of &#x27;thou shalt static link&#x27;. It&#x27;s simply not a big priority to stabilise an ABI, in large part because it&#x27;s quite hard to do right, especially with the other things rust does prioritise. And the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t seem to think it&#x27;s a huge deal either. Distro maintainers are more or less the only people I&#x27;ve seen who really care about it.\n\n      This, pretty much.  You can code a shared object&#x2F;dynamically linked library in Rust, and it will work as a drop-in replacement for one that&#x27;s coded in C.  Rust also has extensive support for interfacing with C shared objects.\n\n      &gt; I don&#x27;t think rust is &#x27;fanatic&#x27; about it, there&#x27;s no cultural or organisational push of &#x27;thou shalt static link&#x27;.<p>Rust users have a &quot;fanatic&quot; ideology about static linking is a stretch.  But rust is indeed now firmly wedded to recompiling everything.  This is true despite the fact that ever growing compile times are a major complaint about the language.<p>What Rust users are fanatic about is monomorphisation.  That boils down to the compiler implementing generic types using C++ style templates instead of C++ style vtables.    Monomorphisation means the compiler produces a custom version of most libraries for your application or more precisely, the types your application uses.  It probably contributes it&#x27;s speed.  But since they are customised to your application there is no point sharing them, so shared libraries are kinda pointless.<p>Like C++ Rust supports both the vtable a template style, but assumption the compiler knows the Size of every object is baked in pretty deep.  Parameters have the Sized constraint by default for example, and a standard trick to get around the borrow checker is to copy everything, which you can only do if you know its size.  I don&#x27;t see it changing now - the language will life or die by the choice.\n\n    &gt; <i>&quot;But unlike the entire rest of Debian it&#x27;s entirely &amp; purely -dev packages.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard that before and wondered what it means, so maybe someone can explain. My primitive understanding is that the regular package has the  binary (executable or library) plus  any additional files like man pages. The -dev package is the header files and the source package is the Debian patched source that can build the regular package. How is it different for Rust?<p>BTW Debian has a nice list of what is available from the Rust world:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qa.debian.org&#x2F;developer.php?email=pkg-rust-maintainers%40alioth-lists.debian.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qa.debian.org&#x2F;developer.php?email=pkg-rust-maintaine...</a>\n\n    That&#x27;s because shared libraries have an extremely heavy bias towards C. They&#x27;re ill-suited for languages that have generics, and use monomorphisation or rely on inlining. The standard .so format and dynamic linker don&#x27;t support features that can&#x27;t be dumbed down to look like C.\n\n      You are making an assumption that shared libraries have to somehow be compatible with the C ones and use the C dynamic linker: you can 100% have your own dynamic linker and have your little ecosystem work the way <i>you</i> want it to work for your language, and you also (to be clear) absolutely can do this without having to be Apple and controlling the &quot;system&quot; dynamic linker (which again is itself just a convention really) to add features as they do with Swift&#x2F;Objective-C. (Hell: even just having an alternative C standard library on your system demonstrates a separate linker ecosystem as the C dynamic linker is effectively shipped as part of the C standard library.) The only thing that matters here is not the disk format or the mechanism but how it would be packaged and the tradeoffs on when time has to be put into baking them.\n\nI understand that rustup can be convenient, but I don&#x27;t get why they insist on using this tool. It should be enough to distribute the toolchain and std as a zip file.\n\n  Standalone installers for Rust: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forge.rust-lang.org&#x2F;infra&#x2F;other-installation-methods.html#standalone\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forge.rust-lang.org&#x2F;infra&#x2F;other-installation-methods...</a>\n\n  rustup makes it easy to have multiple Rust versions installed side by side, so you can test compatibility with older versions, or try beta or nightly builds (e.g. `cargo +1.77.0 test`). I think that functionality is rustup-specific and not easily replicable with tarballs or apt.<p>Apart from that rustup makes it easy to add and remove optional components, libraries for cross-compilation, and update Rust itself. These things could in theory be done with apt if Debian repackaged all of these components, but they didn&#x27;t. Having one way to manage Rust installation that works the same on all platforms makes it easier to teach Rust and provide install instructions for software.\n\nI wish rust supported openbsd. Not sure if I am blaming the right entity, but rust on openbsd is lame.\n\n  I don’t think “blame” is how I’d frame it personally, but the OpenBSD folks have seemed to mostly just hate on Rust, and platforms are generally added to Rust by the folks who are interested in the platform, so that’s why it is the way it is (and that goes for every platform really).\n\n    Well, that would be beyond me. Thanks for the info!"

And as such, the two things should not share a name. Renaming one or the other would be appropriate now.\n\n        But the entire issue is that because the immigration is illegal, there&#x27;s no way to actually vet the circumstances of the people being transported.\n\n        I didn’t think people were including all illegal immigration in human trafficking, but only pointing out that where illegal immigration occurs there is also human trafficking. Illegal prostitution isn’t human trafficking, but they are closely related.\n\n      police freely use &quot;human trafficking&quot; to refer to all prostitution. Which is absurd.\n\n  Several nations have legalized prostitution in ways where you can be a prostitute in business for yourself, but can&#x27;t have someone above you taking a cut.  This has the downside of preventing prostitutes from banding together to share rent for a space but it does a lot to limit pimping.  Further improvements to the law could potentially allow for shared rental agreements of various types as long as there isn&#x27;t someone getting a % cut and that would still effectively keep pimping illegal.\n\n&gt;Taken together, the empirical evidence hints at the notion that the rise in rapes is not connected to the supply of prostitution but rather to changes in the demand for prostitution due to the ban.<p>Wild that some end up raping instead of illegally visiting a prostitute.\n\nThe first graph [1] does not show correlation in trends ...

The increase is a key point of the original post.\n\nAlso in Rhode Island: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;7&#x2F;15&#x2F;5898187&#x2F;prostitution-rhode-island-decriminalized\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;7&#x2F;15&#x2F;5898187&#x2F;prostitution-rhode-isl...</a>\n\nDid rape decrease as porn got more ubiquitous?  I would think it is a similar correlation, no?<p>Found an answer to my own question: &quot;Victimization rates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse relationship between pornography consumption and rape rates. Data from other nations have suggested similar relationships.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S1359178909000445\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S13591...</a>\n\n  I hope so, cause I&#x27;m 2nd-amendment on porn. I&#x27;m hoarding it for the end times.\n\n    That’s great. I’m not; it isn’t even speech, and I reject the Lockean view of “freedom” anyway (which is actually license). Porn is incredibly destructive. Indeed, both pornography and prostitution are unethical, but of the two, prostitution is less bad. At least there’s another person involved, and the sex act is real, however defective. Less defective and destructive than glad handing yourself and laying waste to your mind that’s also difficult to recover from.<p>Here we must distinguish between state permission and state sanction. The state can licitly permit certain evils if banning them leads to a worse situation, given the crooked state of humanity. Prostitution was traditionally one of these.\n\n      Prostitution and pornography are both far less destructive than other evils like religion. Let&#x27;s start by banning those first.\n\nApparent earlier draft of the paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;100393&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_100393.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;100393&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_100393.p...</a><p>I haven&#x27;t paid to read the linked article, but the abstracts do differ significantly. Perhaps the work in the above link is presumably not representative of the final published version, which is about 20 pages shorter. That could just be formatting differences, though. About 60% of the pages in the earlier version are figures and tables, many of which get, but do not fill, a dedicated page. The author has presumably had ~5 years to keep working on it in the intervening time. That could either be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on various factors including one&#x27;s own opinion on how the scientific process should work.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m always pretty <i>a priori</i> skeptical of this style of economic &quot;natural experiment&quot;. I&#x27;m rather fond of economist Ronald Coase&#x27;s observation that, &quot;if you torture the data long enough, it will confess.&quot; And 5+ years is a long time to spend p-hacking one set of data. But it&#x27;s hard to know what all is in a 30-page paper based on just a 150-word abstract. So I would encourage people to be very cautious about getting too caught up in dissecting and discussing this without taking some time to digest the whole thing first. Arguably Hacker News is just not the right venue in the first place because it&#x27;s set up to reward opinions that people can assemble in a matter of minutes, and digesting and understanding the merits of a 30-page economics paper probably deserves more like a week&#x27;s worth of time.\n\nThe paper: &quot;Prior to 1999, prostitution was not regulated in Sweden.&quot;<p>Reality: &quot;The earliest law to explicitly ban prostitution was in the Civil Code of 1734.&quot;\n\nI think the liberal immigration policy might play a role here. Sweden has taken a huge amount in the past 15 years, twenty percent of the population are immigrants.<p>Obviously, most of them are not criminals. But on a group level, they are more likely to commit crimes. About 2x compared to Swedes, after adjusting for income, age and education (it&#x27;s higher before adjusting, obviously).<p>Digging deeper, there are large differences between groups.<p>For example, the group men (compared to women) are much more likely to commit crimes. Another factor that stands out is geography. People from East Asia have similar crime-rates as Swedes, while people from Africa are 5-10x as likely to commit crimes (compared to Swedes).<p>This holds for most categories, including violent crimes, sexual crimes and a bunch of other groups.<p>Here is the landing page from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, a governmental agency:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bra.se&#x2F;publikationer&#x2F;arkiv&#x2F;publikationer&#x2F;2021-08-25-misstankta-for-brott-bland-personer-med-inrikes-respektive-utrikes-bakgrund.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bra.se&#x2F;publikationer&#x2F;arkiv&#x2F;publikationer&#x2F;2021-08-25-...</a><p>Here is the report with the data mentioned above:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bra.se&#x2F;download&#x2F;18.1f8c9903175f8b2aa70f6df&#x2F;1631107319978&#x2F;2021_9_Misstankta_for_brott_bland_personer_med_inrikes_respektive_utrikes_bakgrund.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bra.se&#x2F;download&#x2F;18.1f8c9903175f8b2aa70f6df&#x2F;163110731...</a>\n\n  Yeah.

I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that unacceptable to ask it to help, after they did their best within the regulated framework.\n\n    Yea, it&#x27;s like the government knows the problems induced by rigid structures near the ocean and most people have no clue because they &quot;want what they want&quot; and have never picked up a textbook to even begin understanding the damage they are causing.\n\n  I was more interested in the comment that more permanent sea wall structures are prohibited. Maybe the residents feel like if their hands are tied then the government doing the tying should help? I don’t really know the local politics or reasoning though.\n\n    Changing the erosion pattern in one place. What if the change causes higher levels of erosion in a natural reserve or less affluent area?\n\n  &gt; Property owners dumped 15,000 tons of sand in a Massachusetts town\n  to fend off dangerous tides, but it was swept away in 72 hours<p>The assistance they could benefit from most is not financial but a\nshort educational course on basic construction science. Sand is not a\ngreat building material. It even mentions that in the bible (Matthew\n7:24-27).\n\n    If you read the article, it was pretty much the only thing the government allowed them to do.\n\n      I really despise the EPA.  They have moved beyond their original charter of protecting the environment to protecting the property of some rich people at the expense of others--including poor people.  I bet there&#x27;s places in Massachussets that has similar properties but are the &#x27;right kind&#x27; of rich people so they get variances.  And by right kind, I mean people who have generational wealth and not just wealth that was earned by years of hard work like most shore town home owners.\n\n      I did read the article and it was still a stupid thing to do.  It was\nstupid with or without government approval and it was stupid whether\nor not I read the article. What was your point?\n\n  I agree, but to be fair it was also the state that limited them such a silly option. They can&#x27;t do anything more permanent than sand. Which, I understand has an environmental impact, but the beaches are going to keep eroding so why not &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; so to speak and help protect the beaches more permanently. Regardless of how lives there now.<p>* I live in the state but no where near the water. So I&#x27;m sure my taxes will be paying for this.\n\n    Geomorphology doesn’t see lines in the sand. Development on sand dunes should simply not be allowed (as much as I like visiting the beach too).\n\n      I didn&#x27;t mean it literally. a &quot;line in the sand&quot; is an idiom.\n\n    &gt;help protect the beaches more permanently.<p>Then you get rid of the houses....<p>The shape of the shore is an equation. In it you have have a <i>massive</i> pool of energy that is the water and its currents. You have a second smaller, yet still massive in human terms, pool of energy in the wind. Then you have the slope of the land from a few miles on shore to many (maybe even hundreds of miles) offshore.  This is the lever of the machine. It weighs billions of tons and is miles long. What exactly does permanent mean when you stick something between an anvil and hammer that grinds down mountains. And in specific, you stick it where it becomes the focal point for that energy?\n\n      That is why I said <i>more</i> permanently. 10 years is better than 72 hours. To say &quot;get rid of the houses&quot; as a solution to beach erosion without considering legal, social, and economic implications is a classic case of oversimplifying a complex problem.\n\n        At some point the bill needs paid, and like all moral hazards, this is one that foots the bill to someone else in the meantime.<p>Physics doesn&#x27;t care about the dumb economic&#x2F;political decisions you made in the past. Pushing it 10 years just creates 10 more years of damage to yourself and others and burns money the entire time.<p>You&#x27;re acting like you can just science&#x2F;money your way out of a problem that has grown massively over the last 70 years, but we no longer can. The bill is due with interest. Yea, you can roll over the debt if you want, but the house of cards falls down eventually.\n\n    The beaches keep eroding because the dune ecosystem that was in place to keep the sand there was destroyed to put beachside housing on it.\n\n  Things which make sense to me:<p>1. Deregulate &#x2F; reregulate to where residents are allowed to build a seawall instead of sacrificial dunes.<p>2. Bring in the Army Corp of Engineers to help with design, planning, and evaluation.<p>Things which don&#x27;t make sense to me:<p>1. Blocking people from doing the work.<p>2. Funding the actual construction with state or federal dollars.<p>This is not an isolated problem. The Army Corp of Engineers should have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to plan this well. Assisting in projects like this is how you develop that skill set.\n\n    The problem with diverting water is that it goes somewhere else. The issue is that Salisbury is in the way of the ocean. Trying to build your way out of that is not going to work. They could establish an annual sand budget and treat it just like snow removal.\n\n      I&#x27;m not sure water needs to be diverted, per se. The problem isn&#x27;t baseline water level but waves, and especially large waves, and sand washing away. It seems like the solutions would involve some combination of:<p>* Breakwaters, to equalize the water levels and reduce the waves<p>* A few meters inland, some kind of wall (firmer than sand) which doesn&#x27;t wash away, so a bigger wave doesn&#x27;t impact homes<p>* Perhaps some kind of reinforcement underneath the sand<p>It might reduce littoral drift a little bit, but as I understand, this would be done the length of a rather long coastline, so that&#x27;s not really an issue.<p>I have very mixed feelings about just dumping tons of sand into the ocean each year. That&#x27;s going to have its own impacts.\n\n        You seemingly don&#x27;t understand the costs and long term effects of what you&#x27;re asking.<p>Just dumping sand on the beach is positively cheap compared to the hundreds of millions you&#x27;re asking for. Also, building a wall near the ocean is possibly the worst idea you could ever do. Please research the interaction between air, water, and sand to learn this is how you make a massive hole that swallows everything. The same is true with breakwaters. Constant refurbishment is needed, and it changes sand flows that affect other people.\n\n          Glad to do research! Can you give me pointers?<p>This seems like the sort of problem we ought to learn to solve. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d like us to try things, and I&#x27;m happy to have a little bit of my tax dollars involved. This problem will only be more and more common.\n\n            If you want a book that directly faces the problem look at &quot;Pitfalls of Shoreline Stabilization: Selected Case Studies&quot;.<p>Of course you&#x27;ll want to balance that out with books that just talk about the general challenges and successes, in which I&#x27;d recommend just looking at books.google.com on writings by the US Army Corp of Engineers. They talk about practical mitigations for different types of erosion.<p>Most success stories are going to be based on things like using plants&#x2F;growth to trap and build sand, which typically means lowering human access to the beach and ensuring tall things that interrupt wind flow are not near the beach. For example mangroves in climates that allow them to grow.<p>There are also plenty of examples poing out by the C of E on things that cannot be solved. If you built a city near a portion of the beach that was eroding long before humankind appeared in to the picture, all you can do is slow that erosion and at great expense. The ocean is far more powerful than you can imagine.\n\n              Thank you!\n\n    I don&#x27;t think the Army Corp of Engineers should be wasting taxpayer dollars on this either. Zero federal taxpayer dollars of any kind should be going to building in the way of the ocean just so people can have a beach view.<p>If people are actually living in the at-risk properties as their primary residence, I&#x27;d support spending taxpayer dollars to help them move.\n\n  I agree with your sentiment, but you missed half the article if that was the last sentence you read. You quoted the last sentence before an ad. The article continues below the ad.\n\n  I don&#x27;t know, in my place (the West coast of France) it&#x27;s the government&#x27;s job to protect citizens property.<p>There used to be a dike built in 1856 but it eroded away and in the 90s when I was young the broken sections were replaced with just big rocks[0]. It works quite fine, I believe they wouldn&#x27;t count as a &quot;hard structure&quot; which is forbidden in this case, and they don&#x27;t wash away like sand. Beaches form, naturally or with wave breakers, at the foot of the dike like they did before.<p>But I really don&#x27;t understand why individual homeowners would be expected to conduct public works themselves like building dikes.<p>[0]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;as2.ftcdn.net&#x2F;v2&#x2F;jpg&#x2F;01&#x2F;78&#x2F;00&#x2F;19&#x2F;1000_F_178001923_PwzegQo2m0kC7Br4QdZmHDQRZlGzY8Wo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;as2.ftcdn.net&#x2F;v2&#x2F;jpg&#x2F;01&#x2F;78&#x2F;00&#x2F;19&#x2F;1000_F_178001923_Pw...</a>\n\n    Because they built houses in place they shouldn&#x27;t have\n\n      Were they illegally built without a permit? Then they should be demolished. Were they built with a permit? Then either it wasn&#x27;t obvious they shouldn&#x27;t have been built (and then why would the homeowners be responsible for these kind of works?) or there was corruption (and then the relevant persons should be condemned). But privately built seawalls to protect the coast? That seems out of proportion, and unlikely to produce positive results on the long term.<p>In the same area I&#x27;m talking about, people died in flooding during cyclone Xynthia, in 2010. It wasn&#x27;t because of a particular weakness in the seawall, it was found that these homes should never have been built in the first place.<p>But they had been built legally, with permits obtained from the town, so 700 of these homes were <i>bought</i> (by the state, not sure exactly which levels the funds came from but France is a unitary state so it doesn&#x27;t matter much) and demolished. And the mayor who granted the obviously bogus permits was sentenced to prison for the 29 deaths he caused.\n\n        The houses were built 100 years ago, when the ocean was hundreds of feet further away. If you asked the builders, I&#x27;m sure they would have told you that this would happen in a century or so. Erosion of sandy beaches isn&#x27;t a surprise.\n\n        In theory, yes hundreds of billions (maybe trillions of dollars) in houses and building need purchased and destroyed in the US.<p>This will not happen. Houses&#x2F;businesses near beaches tend to be of higher value and owned by the more politically connected. Any political talk of &quot;We&#x27;re not going to insure it and we&#x27;ll let it fall in the ocean&quot; means new people getting elected next election.<p>It&#x27;s also worse than that in the US. We&#x27;re permitting and allowing things that will fail, and have no means of funding those costs of buyout or replacement in the future. As long as people remain ignorant and keep voting themselves largess the cost of the problem will continue to grow.\n\n  I&#x27;m fine with government providing assistance, as long as property tax collected matches the expenditure.\n\nIf you’re betting against the ocean, half a million bucks seems like a piddling small amount to bring to the table.<p>Like, so small an amount that you probably shouldn’t be allowed to play the game.<p>Part of why you have table stakes is to keep small players out of the game, and the ocean is maybe the biggest, most powerful player in the largest game on earth. (Metaphorically speaking, of course.)\n\n  Looks like our carbon footprint actually is defeating the ocean’s ability to absorb it, via the phyoplankton and the acidification results in massive changes.\n\n    The ocean isn&#x27;t going to disappear due to global warming. It&#x27;ll just change and rejuvenate itself long after we&#x27;re gone. The ocean is the house, and the house always wins.\n\n  There is a method of sand nourishment that works for much longer time, the sand engine. But you&#x27;re talking about $10 million for a small one. The first one constructed was 70 million euro.\n$500k does seem to little to play this game.\n\n  Eh, the ocean is just moisture on the outside of the rock, it seems like a big deal to us because the rock itself is <i>so</i> enormous we just forget its there. There is so much rock that <i>just by existing</i> it exerts a powerful force on us all the time and we just don&#x27;t even think about that.<p>It&#x27;s so enormous that we <i>don&#x27;t know for sure what&#x27;s inside it</i>. It&#x27;s very hot in there, and radioactive, and generally hostile to life as we know it, but we&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface, we haven&#x27;t really tunnelled much deeper into the rock than the thin layer of moisture you&#x27;re making a big deal about, which is essentially nothing - a few kilometers. The rock is like twelve <i>thousand</i> kilometres across.\n\nA lesson learned from boating, and living on waterfront property:<p>Water always wins.\n\n  Agreed. You can’t push back the ocean.\n\n    Tell that to The Netherlands.\n\n      They have been &quot;at war&quot; with water for centuries now. Several floods have occurred, the last major flood was in the 1950&#x27;s, IIRC. For the most part they have managed to keep the water out, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider their battle fully settled yet.\n\n  The Dutch would disagree\n\n    Two things....<p>1. They spend something like 1.5% of their GDP so they can double the size of their country. This works ok for small countries, but not large ones (think more of city protection for larger places).<p>2. This will eventually get them sued in international court when one of their projects affects surrounding countries. The ocean is filled with butterfly effects.\n\n      1. This doesn&#x27;t seem relevant to the flat, decisive statement that water always wins.<p>2. Unless the water is represented by international court, it still doesn&#x27;t count as a win for water.\n\n        Your logic is quite questionable.<p>1. If a bully shows up and tries to beat you up, so you hit him in the face. You won, right? But what if we comes back tomorrow and tries again. What if he never stops coming back every single day forever. You have not won. At best you are in a stalemate in which you have to keep up the fight pouring massive amounts of money and effort into your game otherwise catastrophic outcomes (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_Sea_flood_of_1953\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_Sea_flood_of_1953</a>)<p>2. If in that fight you shift the burden of the fight on to your neighbor, you&#x27;re just an asshole, not a winner. And you&#x27;re still caught in the loop of point 1.\n\n      &gt; 2. This will eventually get them sued in international court when one of their projects affects surrounding countries. The ocean is filled with butterfly effects.<p>That&#x27;s bizarre. Do you really think the Dutch will at some point get sued because of the dikes they have built to keep out the water? Maybe somebody should warn them, I can assure you that nobody in the Netherlands has ever considered that possibility ..\n\n    They haven&#x27;t said on what timeline the water will win.\n\n&gt; the volunteer organization behind the dune project, said on Facebook that even though the expensive protection mechanism was destroyed within days, “the sacrificial dunes did their job”, arguing that much more could have been destroyed were it not for the presence of the dune.<p>Either that, or the sand dune project was a result of their own gross incompetence\n\n&gt; Local news outlet Fox59 reported that the Republican state senator Bruce Tarr was working to secure $1.5m in state funding to replenish the sand.<p>&gt; Tarr, noting that a more permanent seawall was not an option because hard structures like these are not allowed on Massachusetts beaches<p>If the only alternative is to drain state funds dumping tonnes of sand that quickly get swept away, then it&#x27;s time to change the (by)laws.\n\n  I wonder what the logic is behind the hard structure ban. Is it only aesthetics, or is there some ecological reason?\n\n    hard structures increase erosion around it. maybe its something to do with that.\n\n      That depends on design and implementation.<p>Elmer Sands on the UK south coast, was badly affected by erosion. Authorities built a series of elongated rock islands parallel with the shore (visible here [1]). These a) protect the shore from wave damage, and b) encourage the build up of sand behind them, ie between them and the shore. Yes, there is still erosion, but you can better control where it happens and who it affects.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@50.7920857,-0.6012103,1309m&#x2F;data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@50.7920857,-0.6012103,1309m&#x2F;d...</a>\n\n    In Japan, you’d very likely get tetrapods.<p>It’s either aesthetic reasons or maybe they think they’re unnatural and can have consequences for other shorelines.<p>I wonder if compacted sand that’s pretty hard would work any better?<p>In a way, they got their money’s worth.  Without that sand it’s likely some of those structures would have been damaged.\n\n  Or eminent domain the properties nearby and make people move to someplace where they won&#x27;t be washed out to sea like that sand was. Unlike the perpetual sand bill, it&#x27;s a one-time cost for ME.\n\n  The problem is that seawalls are very expensive and make the problem worse for your neighbors. If you build a sea wall, you break the natural process which replenishes sand on the adjacent beaches and they’ll shrink and disappear.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wbur.org&#x2F;onpoint&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;lessons-from-california-on-how-to-adapt-to-sea-level-rise\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wbur.org&#x2F;onpoint&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;lessons-from-califor...</a><p>The real solution is to accept that anyone who bought in the last half century should have factored in the scientific evidence of climate change and not expect taxpayers to subsidize their failure to plan appropriately.<p>At this point, the window for easily dealing with the problem is long closed and we should be prepared to write off high-risk areas: give the current residents support for moving somewhere safe and turn the land into a preserve where we can let the local ecosystem recover. A lot of beaches around the world have involved clearing things like mangroves which improve storm resilience, too, so restoration would help everyone further from the shore.\n\n    These homeowners cleaned the beaches free of any plants that would have helped prevent this in order to make their homes look nicer.<p>These people just want sympathy and for someone to pay for their mistakes.\n\n    &gt;The real solution is to accept that anyone who bought in the last half century should have factored in the scientific evidence of climate change and not expect taxpayers to subsidize their failure to plan appropriately.<p>Glad someone said this. If you got money to buy properties at Martha Vineyard, then how much do you really believe in climate change? People who build there should just accept the risk that their properties will be destroyed with little notice.\n\n    A sea wall performs much differently than a properly sloped structure. There are different engineering approaches to this problem and they function well when in place.<p>That said, it&#x27;s a waste of time, money and resources.\n\n    &gt;The problem is that seawalls are very expensive<p>That&#x27;s only one problem... The bigger problem is something you hit at, which is mass ignorance of complex topics that end up getting turned in to political sound bites. At least 30 years ago, and probably longer you could pick up books on bathymetry and arenology that described the physics of the situation and really gave dire warnings. Without adding things like rising sea level, the moment you start building near the beach bad things start happening quickly. Tall building interrupt wind currents, these wind currents change the shape and angle of the beach. Changing the shape of the beach changes the how waves scour the sand off the beach and leads to rapid erosion. This leads to people building sea walls, which just moves the feedback loop out a bit. What typically happens without constant replenishment is the ocean will continue to get deeper directly up to the seawall (losing your prime tourist attraction) until the seawall falls over.<p>A seawall is how you turn a million dollar problem in to a billion dollar one.<p>At the end of the day human ambitions and the ocean are not really compatible. We like to think we can tame anything and exploit its resources safely and cheaply. To use a bad analogy, it&#x27;s like seeing a beautiful unicorn and capturing it because you love the way it looks. But after you capture it, its bright white coat grows dull and grey. It&#x27;s horn falls off. It gets tons of medical issues requiring more and more expensive treatment. Suddenly everyone is claiming it&#x27;s a ripoff and you never had a unicorn in the first place.\n\n    &gt; The real solution is to accept that anyone who bought in the last half century should have factored in the scientific evidence of climate change and not expect taxpayers to subsidize their failure to plan appropriately.<p>It&#x27;s mostly not even climate change. The reality is that without a great deal of very expensive intervention from humans, sand coastlines are constantly shifting and changing. Building long term structures in these places has ALWAYS been folly.<p>The worst part is it&#x27;s not even irrational because the rest of the country will fund the billions of dollars for state and federal projects to shore up these properties indefinitely.\n\n      &gt; It&#x27;s mostly not even climate change<p>Let me amend that: it’s not just climate change but climate change is like a catalyst for the existing problem. Higher sea level, greater storm intensity and frequency, and other ecological impacts (e.g. native vegetation might not control erosion as well due to changing conditions or invasive pests) all mean we get the harder versions of the problem and have deal with more crises at a time.\n\n        Its more like this was inevitable regardless of climate change on the time period the average housing stock lasts, so building there and expecting this to stay as is was inevitably stupid regardless of climate change.\n\n          The reality is that climate change is resulting in 100 year events becoming 10 year events. Yes, the barrier probably would have been washed away _eventually_ irrespective of our changing climate, but sea levels are rising (104mm since 1993) and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is increasing. Everything that is now happening occurs in the context of our destabilizing climate. Given this, I&#x27;m not sure how supportable it is to declare that climate change is not, at the very least, a contributory factor in events like these.\n\n            Or you know, maybe people are too stupid to estimate probabilities like that. Our history is too short to really know what is normal and what is out of line. In geological terms, we are still very much coming out of an ice age and far from peak temperatures that we know have happened before.\n\n              &gt;  In geological terms, we are still very much coming out of an ice age<p>In geological terms, AGW aside, the earth was still very much within the Late Cenozoic Ice Age and has been for 34 million years.<p>In glaciation terms the earth was swinging out of an inter glaciation period and due to return to glaciation and decreasing global tempretures and increasing ice coverage.<p>Thanks to human activity increasing the insulation attributes of the atmosphere mean tempretures are increasing and global mean tempretures will increase past what we (as a human species) have experienced in our brief time on the planet.<p>&gt;  far from peak temperatures that we know have happened before.<p>It&#x27;s true - we&#x27;re a long way from living on the surface of a near molten ball of rock with no breathable atmosphere, as the earth once was.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Late_Cenozoic_Ice_Age\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Late_Cenozoic_Ice_Age</a>\n\n                Ok you got me. I meant in the last few hundred million years it has been way hotter than today. Life existed and thrived back then as well. We are coming out of an ice age and temperatures must necessarily increase as a result, regardless of any presumed impact humans have on that process. This may be interfering with estimations of the impact of CO2 on our atmosphere. I&#x27;m not claiming to be an expert on this but I am skeptical of people who claim to be experts on this, as alarmism inherently boosts their careers.\n\n                  &gt; Life existed and thrived back then as well.<p>Hate to break it to you, but humans <i>are not</i> stromatolites.<p>Humans have been about for two million years and have evolved to live in recent climatic conditions and to thrive in the extremely relatively stable Holocene.<p>&gt;  We are coming out of an ice age<p>On what evidence?<p>By the record we are in an ice age (do see and read my prior link) and not only were we expected to stay in that ice age but were expected to return to increased glaciation (ie <i>decreasing</i> tempretures).<p>The <i>only</i> reason we are coming out of an ice age is due to human activity increasing the bulk insulation properties of the atmosphere.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not claiming to be an expert on this<p>I&#x27;ve spent four decades in geophysical exploration developing instruments and software for mapping earths energy and mineral resources for extraction.<p>I&#x27;m also not claiming to be an expert but I have some exposure to continent and global scale modelling of gravity, radiometrics, magnetic fields, tidal movements, drift, etc.\n\n                    This page has some good general information that you ought to be aware of before talking to people about this topic: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ces.fau.edu&#x2F;nasa&#x2F;module-3&#x2F;temperature-trend-changes&#x2F;past-climates.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ces.fau.edu&#x2F;nasa&#x2F;module-3&#x2F;temperature-trend-chan...</a> In short, the planet&#x27;s temperature shifts wildly in geological time, even in a human time scale. Our written language and species may eventually survive long enough to convey all of this information past the next ice age, whenever that is to happen.<p>&gt;The only reason we are coming out of an ice age is due to human activity increasing the bulk insulation properties of the atmosphere.<p>The climate is naturally cyclical, as explained in my reference above and many other academic sources. Again I&#x27;m not suggesting there is no human impact but that this may be difficult to isolate, no matter how confident various researchers claim to be in their models. We humans have lived through an ice age only 20k years ago and that ice age has been ending ever since, and not because of us. As an armchair geologist you should know about that as well as the Little Ice Age much more recent than that. This looks interesting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ice-age-human-survival\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ice-age-human-survival</a>\n\n          Higher sea levels are a good counter example to your point. Nobody thinks of normal housing lasting the thousands of years that process takes when you are think in terms of ice ages and warming periods, but a relatively modest rise makes a big difference when you’re thinking about things like how much a given house is exposed to storm surge.<p>Similarly, forest fires are always a risk but the fires are bigger, more frequent, and hotter when climate change had been drying out previously wet regions. That means society needs to plan for huge increases in response capacity in much larger regions than previously was the case, so again while it’s technically possible for there to be a fire anywhere those are very different situations from the prospective of everyone on defense.<p>Think of it like the way armies had to change going from flintlocks to automatic weapons, only we’re doing it much faster and are going to have to make hard sacrifices.\n\n    There&#x27;s definitely a significant amount of &quot;leopards ate my face&quot; going on here, but I think a fair few people simply don&#x27;t know better. They see a beautiful beachfront property and when the weather is good, it&#x27;s all hunky dory.<p>But then a hurricane moves in and levels everything to the ground, and the real estate agents neglect to mention that this will happen on a regular basis.\n\n      Another weird one I’ve heard are people saying it can’t be that bad if insurers cover it, followed by dismay when the premiums double multiple years running.<p>I think the solution will end up involving some changes to federal disaster aid: FEMA will give you relocation assistance if you sell your house to BLM to become part of the coastal buffer reserve.\n\n  In the 1950’s Lake Michigan had a similar problem. Academics at MSU measured the sand volume over time and realized that the amount of sand was receding quickly.<p>So they took on a massive project to plant marram grass all along the lakeshore. This takes several years to mature, however once it does the roots grow deep and the sand stays in place for a much longer period of time.<p>I am not sure what this community can do now, it feels a little too late. Maybe build a temporary sea wall, plant grass to hold the new sand, then remove the sea wall?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnfi.anr.msu.edu&#x2F;communities&#x2F;description&#x2F;10714&#x2F;Sand\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnfi.anr.msu.edu&#x2F;communities&#x2F;description&#x2F;10714&#x2F;Sand</a>\n\n  It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re doing a shitty job of restoring the dunes. If you dump a ton of sand of course it&#x27;s going to be washed away. There&#x27;s literally nothing keeping it there. If they want to keep a dune there they have to rehabilitate the whole dune ecosystem and part of that is having an ecosystem between them and the ocean. If there were plants established and holding onto the sand they wouldn&#x27;t be washing away in three days!<p>Massachusetts literally gives a guide for this shit but these idiots are just DUMP MORE SAND THIS TIME IT&#x27;LL WORK!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mass.gov&#x2F;info-details&#x2F;landscaping-a-coastal-beach-or-dune\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mass.gov&#x2F;info-details&#x2F;landscaping-a-coastal-beac...</a>\n\n    Or to say it another way, they are spending $500k on a $5+ million dollar problem that requires buy in from a huge number of people over a long distance and to change behaviors of people using the beach to ensure they don&#x27;t kill any plants and mitigations.\n\n  The houses are getting swept out to sea. The pace may have increased in recent years but this has been a fact of life on the sandy beaches of MA for centuries.\n\nThe take away for me was that policy needs to change. Massachusetts prevents hard sea walls. Long term that seems like the only solution. Or people move away from living directly next to the ocean given that it is going to be a constant money sink for society so a small % of the population can enjoy a view and lifestyle unavailable to the people paying for it (presuming the state assists them in dumping more sand, or eventually constructing a sea wall).\n\n  &gt;Massachusetts prevents hard sea walls. Long term that seems like the only solution.<p>Depending on your definition of long term, the ocean always wins. Sea walls destroy the beach and environment. We have to decide what we&#x27;re saving here, you can&#x27;t save both.\n\nWelcome to the eastern seaboard.  Where I grew up, they use jettys--actually groins--to try and stop the sand from naturally migrating south so the army corps of engineering has to come out every few years and dredge.\n\nIt&#x27;d be nice to hear what sober expectations were for the $500k dune.  I&#x27;d guess the experts knew that one modest storm would remove it.<p>&gt; Republican state senator Bruce Tarr was working to secure $1.5m in state funding to replenish the sand.<p>...so if $500k of sand was washed away in 3 days, how long will $1.5m worth of sand last?<p>&gt; Tarr, noting that a more permanent seawall was not an option because hard structures like these are not allowed on Massachusetts beaches, said: “We’re managing a natural resource that protects a lot of interests.”<p>Interesting.  Is Tarr a pro-regulation &#x2F; pro-environmental-protection Republican?<p>And what would be the prospects for a hard structure, anyway?  My impression is that hard reality for many parts of the U.S. Atlantic coastline is &quot;With unlimited money, you can <i>somewhat</i> delay the inevitable&quot;.\n\n  The market will take care of it and sweep those houses out to sea.\n\n    Which will be even more of an environmental tragedy than just letting them have a hard seawall.\n\n  &gt; Interesting. Is Tarr a pro-regulation &#x2F; pro-environmental-protection Republican?<p>It&#x27;s not particularly surprising, I don&#x27;t think?\n\n&quot;sea levels rise due to thermal expansion&quot; ... It is a contributor but not the leading cause.<p>From here[1] (which I was able to find in 1 min)<p>&quot;Both the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US National Climate Assessment conclude that ice loss was the largest contributor to sea-level rise during the past few decades, and will contribute to rising sea levels for the century to come.&quot;<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sealevel.nasa.gov&#x2F;understanding-sea-level&#x2F;overview&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sealevel.nasa.gov&#x2F;understanding-sea-level&#x2F;overview&#x2F;</a>\n\n  Found this<p>&gt;About half of the measured global sea level rise on Earth is from warming waters and thermal expansion.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;edu&#x2F;learn&#x2F;project&#x2F;how-warming-water-causes-sea-level-rise&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;edu&#x2F;learn&#x2F;project&#x2F;how-warming-water...</a><p>Being responsible for 50% looks to me like a leading cause unless there are only two then it&#x27;s one of the two leading causes.\n\nHow many homes are we talking about here? Would it make more long term sense just to abandon them?\n\n  Entire island states like Tuvalu face a similar fate and they have nowhere else to go... I know it&#x27;s unrelated to this particular situation but the sea is the sea and doesn&#x27;t care much about a costly sandy bump. Yes, the Netherlands managed to pull some tricks but the site is different and they used hard structures anyway.\n\n    Honestly at this point Tuvalu should use the money it makes from the .tv domain (and otherwise) to relocate and buy some vast farmland abroad. It&#x27;s sad to see the state of affairs some islands are in. That&#x27;s one kind of refugee immigration I could back. Just 11,000 people.\n\nHow many dolos would 500k buy?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dolos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dolos</a>\n\n  125 pieces, according to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.syracuse.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;oswego_breakwater_reconstruction_underway_what_is_a_dolos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.syracuse.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;oswego_breakwater_reco...</a> which lists them at 4,000 $\n\n  This is not a solution. These things work great for protecting particular objects, but they don&#x27;t protect beaches. In fact they do the opposite and destroy beaches.<p>So instead of a beachfront house, you now have no beach and a big &#x27;rocky&#x27; ocean front that is dangerous for people to use and must 100% keep off of.\n\nThey ought to bring in some Dutch firms.  AFAIK, nobody is better at water management and engineering.\n\nShould&#x27;ve spent it on solar panels 30 years ago.\n\nLook at that picture. It’s the homeowners fault for building so close to the water.\n\n  I think the point is, they were not so close to the water when they were built.\n\nwait til they get sued by the folks two miles down the coast who&#x27;s beautiful sea front gets swamped with sand\n\nWaiting to hear the calls for new strong-state controls on human activity because of ... something changing, somewhere.\n\nIf you want pristine sand beaches then expect major change over time. Looking at areas where there is little change over time, certain coastal structures are in plain sight.<p>But as many have already noted, the sea erodes all coastlines. However, what the sea takes away at one time, it also brings back in another time. When my father was in his teens, the water&#x27;s edge for a small residential site was over a mile away. By the time I was in my teens, that distance had been reduced to 30 metres. By the time I was in my late twenties and early thirties, the water&#x27;s edge was now at half a kilometre further out. Since then (I&#x27;m in the mid 60&#x27;s) that beach has has grown and receded a couple more times.<p>Moral of the story, build only where there is relatively constant conditions.\n\n&gt;Tarr, noting that a more permanent seawall was not an option because hard structures like these are not allowed on Massachusetts beaches, said: “We’re managing a natural resource that protects a lot of interests.”<p>The interests of the wealthy. \nWhen rich people make mistakes, they rarely suffer the consequences.<p>That is why they can arrogantly build housing along beaches without a thought to the outcome.<p>I on the other hand am forced to use my limited resources paying for their mistakes - whether they  build homes on the beach or overinvest in commercial real estate.\n\nI was curious on some of the details, so I did a little digging.<p>The town in question (Salisbury, MA) is built on a narrow strip of land between a marsh and the ocean. Mostly between 2 and 5 houses wide. Doesn&#x27;t seem like you need a geology PhD to determine you&#x27;re going to have some erosion problems here.<p>As best I could determine, the beach replenishment in question was from access points 5 - 11, which covers 1.6 miles and about 150 homes. If I&#x27;m right on that, they put down enough sand to extend the beach 3-7 feet[0]. So the first thing to note is that this was a very small beach replenishment project. The senator is probably right that they should go bigger next time.<p>The cost per home for that would have come out to about $3333.33. Honestly, even if you triple it and do it every year, I don&#x27;t find that to be an unreasonable expense to impose on owners of $1-5 million houses built on a sand dune. These guys need to quit whining and raise their _local_ taxes the relatively modest amount necessary to preserve their town. Something like $5k&#x2F;year for beachfront and $1k&#x2F;year for the rest would get the job done.<p>[0] This is assuming a constant slope to the beach. The low end is extending at 3 feet above sea level, the high end is extending at 6 feet above sea level.\n\n  I don&#x27;t have evidence for this, but my suspicion is that the sand was not supposed to be long-term, but just to look impressive for suckers while the owners dump their now worthless real estate."

Which isn&#x27;t suicide, but surely related.</i><p>If you crawl into a bottle and kill yourself with alcohol, but very slowly, over the course of months&#x2F;years, is that also not suicide?\n\n    According to the CDC, no. But obviously they are closely related.\n\n    I don’t think suicide statistics include cases like this.\n\n    1. Obviously the CDC won&#x27;t count those as suicide<p>2. In general, making a distinction between intentional self-harm and self-harm due to recklessness can be useful in some instances.\n\n      2. How would you? Where&#x27;s the point where the one becomes the other?<p>(rhetoric question)\n\n    You cannot define intention like that, because then it could be applied to almost anything, for example, extreme overeating.\n\npopulation growth and aging are  a thing\n\n  Was there a point involved here, or is this just a particularly vague public service announcement?\n\nAbout 5% of all deaths in Canada in 2023 were by assisted suicide.\n\n  That’s stunning. I have to see a source for that or it’s too unbelievable.\n\n    Wikipedia only has it up to 2022 at 4.1% of all deaths, but it was up 31% YOY then [1]<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euthanasia_in_Canada\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euthanasia_in_Canada</a>\n\n    You can read all the Canadian government’s reports. I believe the latest published was 2022 (4.1% of deaths) and it has a 20-30% annual growth rate (also from the report.) So 5% for 2023 seems easily achieved.<p>There are a lot of other statistics in the reports. Recommended skimming.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;health-canada&#x2F;services&#x2F;publications&#x2F;health-system-services&#x2F;annual-report-medical-assistance-dying-2022.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;health-canada&#x2F;services&#x2F;publications...</a>\n\n    Just did some searching.<p>According to stats Canada, in 2022 there were 334,081 total deaths (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www150.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;t1&#x2F;tbl1&#x2F;en&#x2F;tv.action?pid=1310039401\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www150.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;t1&#x2F;tbl1&#x2F;en&#x2F;tv.action?pid=131003...</a>). There were 13,241 MAID deaths reported in Canada in 2022, according to Wikipedia (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euthanasia_in_Canada\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euthanasia_in_Canada</a>). So that&#x27;s 3.96 % in 2022. So I guess the claim of 5 % is actually possible.\n\n    Funny - in my mind, the ideal would be 100%. No accidents or suicides, just people choosing to end things peacefully once they’ve reached the limits of medicine.\n\n    Via Wikipedia for 2022:<p><pre><code>  13241 &#x2F; 334623 = 0.040\n</code></pre>\n[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euthanasia_in_Canada#Statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euthanasia_in_Canada#Statistic...</a>\n\n    A fair number of those are probably terminally ill patients who don&#x27;t want to wait to die in growing pain&#x2F;humiliation.\n\n    If you think about how assisted suicide is applied in Canada (or at least in Quebec) it&#x27;s really not that surprising.<p>Despite the somewhat negative coverage medical assitance in dying is really given to people with days&#x2F;weeks to live as a way to skip the suffering of when your illness is not quite advanced enough to kill you, but is definitely advanced enough for the person to live in considerable pain.<p>It&#x27;s very common among terminal cancer patients.\n\n    If, say, 50% of people who die do so from extreme old age or wasting away from a disease they&#x27;ll never recover from, what&#x27;s surprising about a culture where 10% of that population decides to end their life a few months early on their own terms?<p>Stepping back, why is something outside your own cultural norms unbelievable in a general sense instead of it feeling natural to you for there to be different cultures? You don&#x27;t have to agree with another culture, but why is it uncomfortable for it to exist?\n\n    Not surprising. There are internet forums dedicated to help young people commit suicide. Yes, these forums offer detailed guides on how to best kill yourself, a marketplace to exchange the necessary materials, and a section where undecided members receive social approval to commit suicide. I assume that&#x27;s what they include as assisted suicide.\n\nI wish news orgs would state these facts on a per-capita basis. Population goes up every year after all, so a record number of X if it is related to population...well, duh. This is like claiming California has the most rich people, poor people, Trump voters, and deaths, when compared to another other state. As it stands, I have no idea if there is a problem or not.\n\n  [edit]<p>These numbers are for 2022; I can&#x27;t even find preliminary numbers for 2023; TFV cites the associated press, but haven&#x27;t found it yet.<p>14.3 per 100k, which is the highest since 1941; in the middle of an economic depression and on the brink of a world war.\n\n  same for controlling for  demographics\n\nThis has floated as the tenth leading cause of death for some time.<p>It fell during the pandemic, sad to see it back.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;suicide&#x2F;facts&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;suicide&#x2F;facts&#x2F;index.html</a>\n\nMy nephew had a spouse cheat problem, one day after drinking, shotgun...<p>Yeah so weird I was snapchatting him days earlier\n\nThe video ends with, &quot;... and maybe most importantly, how do we pay for it.&quot;<p>Is money really the most important consideration though? 1.7 million attempted suicides also has a cost associated with it; Only some of that cost is directly visible in finances.\n\nVideo is a bad way to convey information like this. What&#x27;s the source? CDC suicide data doesn&#x27;t look at all different for 2023 compared to say 2022. This seems a bit of a clickbait title. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;fatal&#x2F;trends.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;fatal&#x2F;trends.html</a>\n\nI feel sad reading this today. This Friday will mark 10 years since my childhood best friend died by suicide. This happened when I was in my early 20&#x27;s and at the time didn&#x27;t quite understand how to process. I was so angry over the situation I couldn&#x27;t think about it with a clear mind. Over the last 10 years I came to learn that the people around me are more important than any anger or grudge I could hold against them. All the moments I&#x27;ve been hurt, angry, or disappointed will never outweigh how much I care about them.\n\n  My childhood best friend died by suicide 2 years ago, after we had been out of contact for ~7 years. We were around 26 at the time. I had no idea what to about it, and it&#x27;s something I still have to deal with as I get more in touch with my memories of childhood. I&#x27;m starting to develop more compassion and gratitude for my past friends, even if we&#x27;re not friends anymore.\n\nSomething is deeply wrong in America.<p>Speaking as someone who finds myself close to the edge at times. My whole generation is on Prozac (myself included). Self-medication is rampant (myself included but improving). There’s a general hopelessness amongst my peers. I don’t think many would say we’re looking at a better, brighter tomorrow.<p>I could list 100 things that make me feel this way. But it’s more than that. It’s something else. Looking around - this country is exceedingly sick. The vibes are bad. Like how dogs can sense someone untrustworthy.<p>We’re all told “it gets better”. That’s great. But you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.<p>I’m here by shear willpower I guess but it continues to not pay off.\n\n  Without listing 100 can you list 10 just to get a general idea?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what generation we&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;m in my late 30s and I don&#x27;t have the same doomsday outlook on life.\n\n    Probably (younger) Millennial or Gen Z based on the latest data<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;unhappy-gen-z-millennials-us-drop-happiness-ranking-1851350932\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;unhappy-gen-z-millennials-us-drop-happin...</a><p>For reasons, there was some discussion about it here[0].

Was that something anyone even remotely considered 20 years ago?<p>8. Businesses are trying to get you addicted to something, because selling something useful isn&#x27;t enough anymore.<p>9. Starting a business is getting harder because you have to compete with liars and scammers competing with literal truckloads of money behind them.<p>10. The atrocities that are being committed on your behalf so all this can keep going. e.g. slave labor for lithium batteries.<p>11. The lack of control over any of the above<p>12. Plastic bits everywhere<p><pre><code>  12a. you cant use plastic without being a monster\n\n  12b. You cant not use plastic\n</code></pre>\n13. Corn being used to fatten everyone up, while also being subsidised so it also steals money from you<p>14. Copywright laws designed to make everything harder, including benign things like buying a new tv and having to update other equipment to comply woth hdcp<p>15. Your job is most likely not even slightly working to make people happier (see also everything is a scam)<p>16. Having children is no longer an asset its a liability<p><pre><code>  16a. This is going to wreck our retirement\n</code></pre>\n17. Looming financial collapse (see also f*</i>deral gaslighting)<p>18. Housing is expensive because people are playing games with the market.<p><pre><code>  18a. Said people are going to get bailed out with your money for losing said game\n</code></pre>\n19. Disappearing to the woods wont help with any of this and you will also be isolating your kids while doing it<p>20. Old cars are getting older and new cars are getting more and more disposable.<p>I havent even put on my tin foil hat yet.<p>If people reply to this comment I&#x27;m sure we can get to 100.\n\n  I too feel every ounce of this.  It&#x27;s in the air.  As a data oriented person I&#x27;m uncomfortable relying on &quot;feels like&quot; and &quot;intuition&quot; but that&#x27;s all I have.<p>The best way I can describe it is &quot;societal rot&quot;.  Just 10 years ago there was optimism in the air.  Now every damn day I see SEVERELY mentally ill people losing their shit in the streets and there&#x27;s more and more of them each month (I live in a medium sized US city).  There&#x27;s human shit all over the sidewalks.  Nudity in front of children.  Are we supposed to think this is ok?<p>I recently ordered food delivery and the girl delivery driver passionately thanked me for a $9 tip.  The desperation and despair in her eyes was disturbing.  I see this same look in too many people.  It&#x27;s not normal.  People seem to be struggling in a way that I&#x27;ve never seen in my life (I&#x27;m 34).<p>Also its difficult to find hope.  It&#x27;s no longer easy to support yourself with a high school education.  In response to that more people got educated.  Great!  We currently have the most educated population in the history of the United States.  But oh no we now have an AI rat race where the main monetization strategy is replacing those white collar jobs with AI.  People can only take so much.<p>BTW I&#x27;m a typically very positive person (based on feedback from peers and co workers)\n\n  A productive, optimistic zeitgeist doesn&#x27;t have:<p>- mass shootings<p>- a negative total fertility rate<p>- an epidemic of drug overdoses<p>- pervasive loneliness<p>- ridiculous homelessness<p>- malignant neglect<p>- oppressive lack of bodily autonomy<p>- lack of healthcare and mental healthcare<p>- rampant depression<p>- crimes and deaths of despair<p>- suicide<p>The root causes are a lack of functional political system and leadership, achievements, and economic equality. Without these, love and sex become impossible unless you&#x27;re one of the special few rich or popular.\n\nI wonder if this is somewhat related to the drop in overall religious belief. Speaking as someone who officially lost my faith after 36 years, it can be challenging to figure out how to replace the relative certainty of purpose and meaning provided by religion. Losing that sense of groundedness can be really difficult, and you have to quickly begin writing your own narrative for life (which can feel pretty fake at first).<p>That’s not to say that we need to keep religion around just to keep us sane. However, finding ways to communicate value and purpose at the individual level is really important.\n\n  I can relate to this. For me, having a child completely turned my life around from depression and lack of purpose. I’m even considering fostering after.\n\nas it stands - not as it should be or as i&#x27;d like things to be - i think that suicide is becoming a valid and reasonable life choice. suicide is unnecessarily emotionalized and moralized in my opinion. it is okay to decide that the party is over and take the consequential steps. but i think it should be a personal decision. i find it despicable when the government starts to incentivize or encourage it as it seems to be the case in canada. but i also think it&#x27;s just as despicable to criminalize it like in germany."

      "conversation_text": "Ohio, Oregon, New Mexico and Arizona\n\n  Which is a statement about their evaluation of their relative economic prospects in California, where they&#x27;re headquartered.\n\n    Well, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to build a new fab in Ohio than CA and the other three states are expansions of existing fabs. In spite of being HQd in CA, Intel doesn&#x27;t even have a full fab there for whatever combination of reasons.\n\n      Does Ohio have the right skills in its labor market though, or will Intel be building from scratch? With the other locations, they already have fans in the area and expanding a workforce is easier than building it from nothing.<p>Ohio’s labor, land, and water are definitely cheaper. And it’s seismically stable.<p>I wonder if there is anything to do with ease of shipping there, either by rail or by Great Lakes + Erie Canal or St Lawrence river that make it ideal for Intel\n\n        I don&#x27;t know the skills situation in Ohio although GlobalFoundries has a fab in upstate NY and is building a second one. They need specific skills of course, but they can also pay very well relative to the local market.\n\n    &gt;Which is a statement about their evaluation of their relative economic prospects in California<p>How does this have anything to do with California economic prospects? Intel already has operations setup in most of those states for years&#x2F;decades.<p>Someone correct me if I am wrong but I always had the impression that a lot of the labor required in these type of plants are technical blue collar work. You need a college degree, the pay is pretty good but most of it is advanced assembly line type of work. I suspect the labor pool in California is difficult.<p>LA and SF are too expensive both land and labor wise. The valley is all Ag. And SAC is ok but getting more expensive. Ignore other input costs I suspect labor is one of the drivers here since at the end of the day it is assembly line work.\n\n  Fabs need a lot of water. Do those states have water to spare?\n\n    I can certainly tell you that AZ had unregulated water usage which was exploited to grow alfalfa and ship that to Saudi Arabia.\n\n    Existing designs certain do depends on how they are designed on whether they recycle their own gray water - TSMC is heading that way, they are aiming for &gt;60% by 2030 because of the water drought they had a few years ago.<p>You&#x27;d hope a newly designed plant would be more water efficient from the start.\n\n    Ohio yes, Oregon yes (Columbia River).\n\n  I find it somewhat strange it is spread out like this. I understand Arizona and Oregon as they are both current Intel Fabs location. New Mexico for historic reason and they had a Fab there and expanding a new Fab 9 with Fab 11. ( Why it was there in the first place is beyond me )<p>But Ohio? Why another location?\n\n    I think because 1) there is abundant water 2) it gives Intel access to a lot of talent from the Midwest (all the universities there) 3) it gives Intel two more Senators who can lobby for them.\n\n    I think you are asking why Intel had factories in New Mexico, right?  In the 1980s, they were expanding and one of their criteria was being less than a 2 hr long flight away from Santa Clara.  That’s how they got started in Aloha, OR, Chandler, AZ and New Mexico.\n\nThis money could be better spent in an ecosystem of fresh new players. Intel had many chances and they keep falling behind.\n\n  Boeing for chips\n\n    You have no idea: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39677243\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39677243</a>\n\n&quot;after securing $19.5 billion in federal grants and loans - and it hopes to secure another $25 billion in tax breaks.&quot;<p>But besides all that... it&#x27;s an <i>investment</i> spree, not a spending spree. They expect to make much more money off the back of those investments.\n\n  After a bunch of delays, maybe they will see some profits: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.silicon.co.uk&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;components&#x2F;tsmc-further-delays-40-billion-arizona-chip-fab-547496\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.silicon.co.uk&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;components&#x2F;tsmc-further-...</a><p>What&#x27;s annoying about this spending spree (from the perspective of the gov) is that this is supposed to secure chips production in North America (motivated by the China threat on Taiwan), but the government doesn&#x27;t really seem to care about delays as it forbids TSMC&#x2F;Intel to bring external talent &amp; include DEI clauses in their deals.\n\n  Although I am rooting for Intel, the leadership is just not an execution machine. Pat is a very good CEO, and he understands technology as much as the business. But the next level simply doesn’t have that charisma to deliver. I wouldn’t be surprised to see many delays and eventually a product which is years behind competition.\n\nHow many chances does Intel get to stay relevant? How many times will it fail to finally succeed?\n\n  We saw that succeeding once isn&#x27;t sufficient, you need to keep improving a-la NVDA fashion. Has intel learned this?\n\nOfficial Commerce release: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commerce.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;biden-harris-administration-announces-preliminary-terms-intel-support\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commerce.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;biden-h...</a>"

I work in tertiary education and the kids coming through now are less tech literate but generally appreciate piracy for everything from visual media to educational material, largly because cost of living has risen, financial support for students has decreased, and income has stagnated or decreased meaning if previous generations were unwilling those now are flat unable to pay for things.<p>What I have noticed is younger folks tend to be smarter about knowing what to say, when and in what context, in a post privacy world."

Go figure?\n\n    This has been researched, the ultra-religious population (with the traditional clothing, very large amount of children, not much of an income) are regularly reporting high levels of happiness.\n\n      With the rest of Israeli society subsidizing their lifestyle choices. Fine, go be as religious as you like but don&#x27;t force me to pay for it!\n\n    Driven especially by having the second most happiest youth. For one, Israel is an advanced country with mostly sunny weather. But the edge in my opinion is military&#x2F;service culture produces a sense of self-actualization in the youth that is lacking in much of the West. Religion also makes people happy, and Israel is a pretty religious country.\n\n      Religion also gives people a somewhat higher than average chance of being murdered by people of a different religion. At least, that&#x27;s how it seems to be in Israel &#x2F; Palestine and actually that whole area.<p>I guess some people around there die happy, believing it is for a good cause, so there&#x27;s no contradiction, at least not from their point of view.<p>I&#x27;d still rather take Norway or New Zealand.\n\n        Israel has amongst the highest life expectancies in the world and without the similar healthcare costs of other countries.\n\n          Point being that religion is strictly a good thing, even when accounting for being more or less at war with other religious nuts for decades?<p>Guess if that&#x27;s what the evidence says...\n\n            Non-religious&#x2F;secular are the largest demographic in Israel by far.\n\n            There&#x27;s no point being made about what is a &quot;good thing&quot; or a &quot;bad thing&quot;, since that depends on the values of the people making the judgment. The point being made here is that having a lot of (religious, family, community) obligations fills one&#x27;s life with a certain sense of worth, importance, meaning, and fulfillment —  and makes them self-report as being happy, when asked by researchers. No judgments about what&#x27;s good or bad.\n\n              Well, if it makes me self-report as happy, and makes me live longer (on average), I hardly think it is useful to say &quot;no judgement on what&#x27;s good or bad&quot;. If living long while being happy is not good, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>I am very surprised though that people in what is nearly a perpetual war, being attacked or hated from all sides, are both subjectively happier and objectively longer living than most of the rest of the planet.<p>Either I have really no clue what happiness is, or we are wrong about the idea that war is bad, at least not in all cases.\n\n                Correlation does not imply causation. Moreover, the general trend does not promise a personal trend.<p>There&#x27;s correlation between being in relationship and reporting happiness. This can be taken as a proof that being in a relationship makes people happy (&quot;marriage brings happiness&quot; hypothesis). An alternative explanation does a U-turn on this one: people who are &quot;naturally happy&quot; are always smiling, take life easy, and basically make for a better partner. They are easier to marry, and easier to stay with once married. This is &quot;happiness brings marriage&quot; hypothesis. The third explanation would be that these are occurring simultaneously but are not in any causal relationship whatsoever.<p>Moreover, even people in Finland are more happy on average, this doesn&#x27;t promise that <i>you</i> would be happier if you move to Finland. Rather, being in a new country with no knowledge of the language and no friends might make <i>you</i> less happy than you are now.<p>In other words, you shouldn&#x27;t take this study in any particular direction of &quot;if you want to be happy you should marry someone&quot;, nor &quot;you should move to Finland&quot;, nor &quot;you should join a religion.&quot;\n\n                  &gt; I&#x27;d still rather take Norway or New Zealand.<p>So I can remain on my original strategy, despite all the precise corrections I received to my ill-conceived notions? Nice.\n\n      Nope. Israel is one of the most secular countries around with more than 40% of the population defined as secular.\n\n        There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;Do you believe in [some sort or form of] God?&quot; and &quot;Do you regularly spend a significant part of your day doing what your God expects from you?&quot;<p>To put that into perspective, imagine a Christian country with 40% of non-believers and 60% of monks (with the monks consistently reporting high levels of happiness). That would strongly remind of Israel. (To be clear, both Jewish and Muslim population is included in the latter.)\n\n          Nope, you have a misconception of the country. Source: am Israeli atheist.<p>Majority is secular. Of the religious people the majority are relatively tame. There are some extremist religious people e.g. Hasidim but they are a cult of their own (think Amish). They probably wouldn&#x27;t even take part in a survey.<p>The reason for happiness is multi-fold:<p>* It&#x27;s a 3 year average. Notice that Israel is actually slipping due to last year.<p>* Economy was generally good until last October<p>* Army service tends to unify the community<p>* It&#x27;s a small country which tends to bring people together through collective fate<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the religious people aren&#x27;t happier than the median. But I am saying that based on statistics Israel is relatively secular. More so than most western countries.\n\n            You’ll be able to enjoy the YouTube lecture by prof. Yuval Harari (as originally recorded) where he addresses the issues of happiness, measuring happiness, and how and why Israeli society ranks so high.\n\n              Not a big fan of his. I think he over simplifies some ideas for mass consumption.<p>Regardless, this is a self reporting study which is the only way to report happiness. Over the past 3 years prior to October Israel had years of peace which are far more appreciated in a country that has known quite a lot of conflict. I think westerners don&#x27;t appreciate this as much as we do.\n\n                You don&#x27;t have to be his fan to hear his explanations about the studies and their methodology, it could be very helpful if one wants to understand what makes people report that they are happy.<p>As the people return from the army feeling they have done something significant to protect their country, and with the public discourse drifting away from the regular &quot;Bibi vs. not Bibi&quot; agenda, I fully expect Israel to report even higher levels of happiness next year.\n\n                  The opposite is happening. There was a decline as it was #3 in last years survey. The army is a unifying force that contributes to happiness after it&#x27;s over. Not during and not during war. Lots of people died and pretty much everyone knows people who died. I expect the decline to last a few years.<p>80% are pretty much interested in Bibi taking a hike by now. The only people who still want him have a deep agenda and never liked him to begin with. He&#x27;s outlived his usefulness even for them.\n\n                    Seeing you expecting it to decline and me expecting it to rise, I guess we could return to this conversation in one year :)\n\n              Do you have a link to his lecture?\n\n                You can start from here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0Oy3sEatMxw?list=PL084D9BAA7417477C&amp;t=3420\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0Oy3sEatMxw?list=PL084D9BAA7417477C&amp;t=3420</a>\n\n        I disagree as an American who moved here. Many things are closed on Shabbat, including public transport! Nobody is driving on Yom Kippur. There is nothing like that in the world. Also that what in the diaspora we consider religious holidays are national holidays here. Israelis are used to all this and consider it part of their national culture, so maybe religious is not the best word. The Jewish identity has a big national component. Hilonim might not define themselves as religious still possess a profound Jewish identity which can come off as a religious identity to an outside observer.\n\n          Public transport is closed due to the minority religious pressure. But there are still traffic jams due to the fact that non-religious people still go out. You can buy pork and shrimps everywhere.<p>As a non religious person I love Yom Kippur. It&#x27;s super fun. We all go out with bikes and have a blast. We respect the religious people and don&#x27;t drive (also it&#x27;s dangerous with all the kids out on bikes). It doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re religious.<p>I accept that most feel they have a Jewish identity. But that isn&#x27;t religion, it&#x27;s tradition.\n\n    There is some discussion about that on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldhappiness.report&#x2F;ed&#x2F;2024&#x2F;happiness-of-the-younger-the-older-and-those-in-between&#x2F;#\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldhappiness.report&#x2F;ed&#x2F;2024&#x2F;happiness-of-the-young...</a>.<p>They did actually drop a pretty significant 0.9 points in the latest poll, but since the list is using three year averages that only caused a 0.3 drop for 2023.\n\n    Heading towards a theocracy, so expected.\n\n  Bhutan is the self-proclaimed “Happiest Country in the World”, going so far as to “measure” Gross Domestic Happiness and claim it’s more important to their government than GDP.<p>Why is Bhutan not on this list?

But the number 1 is very questionable.\n\n    &gt;  A far right government with an xenophobic, anti-EU, &quot;we need a strong leader&quot; party being the second strongest<p>Other things on the list I can understand but not this one. The government is not &quot;far right&quot; and not &quot;xenophobic&quot; (although one of the party in the government might be labeled as such, persus). Compared to US for example I think the current government is much more on the left than either republicans or democrats. The leading party in finland (part of the government) is actively pushing for more work-based migration.<p>Where did you get the &quot;we need a strong leader&quot; rethoric that you mention? I have never seen that from Persus (the party you are refering to)\n\n      The government has generally been described as the most right in modern history in Finland. That is a mixture of &quot;taking from the poor, giving to the rich&quot; and a xenophobic agenda. That not all parties support the xenophobic line does not change the fact that such goals have been written into the agenda and laws are likely to be passed. Not fully as extreme as one party would like, but still.<p>Of course left - right is only one dimension in politics. Nowadays typically another dimension is conservative - liberal, but even 2 dimensions cannot measure everything. So the government could probably be described as the most economic right and the least liberal, I simplified that a bit to far right.<p>That party has no such strong leader agenda, but to my understanding polls show a clear correlation between &quot;everything was better under Kekkonen&quot; (a president for over 25 years with a somewhat authoritarian leader style) and voting for the &quot;True Finns&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Finns Party&quot; today.<p>Either way this government is too young to have a major impact on the study in TFA. My point was more like the other way round: Happy people would not vote for the party of the dissatisfied, simple answers, everything was better before EU&#x2F;the foreigners came. For those following German politics, &quot;Wutbürger&quot; (angry citizens) would typically not be happy people, would they?\n\n        &gt; government has generally been described as the most right in modern history in Finland<p>Which is probably much more on the left than any US government for example and quite far from the &quot;far right&quot; you were stating in previous post.<p>&gt;  &quot;taking from the poor, giving to the rich&quot; and a xenophobic agenda<p>Quite strong words. This sounds very much like your personal opinion instead of a fact.<p>&gt;  to my understanding polls show a clear correlation between &quot;everything was better under Kekkonen&quot; (a president for over 25 years with a somewhat authoritarian leader style) and voting for the &quot;True Finns&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Finns Party&quot; today<p>Sources please for the &quot;clear correlation&quot;. This also sounds very much like your personal opinion.<p>&gt; My point was more like the other way round: Happy people would not vote for the party of the dissatisfied, simple answers, everything was better before EU&#x2F;the foreigners came. For those following German politics, &quot;Wutbürger&quot; (angry citizens) would typically not be happy people, would they?<p>Voting parties more on the right does not mean that &quot;people are not happy&quot;, it mostly means that people understand economic principles.<p>The previous leftist government caused the Finland&#x27;s debt level to raise to very dangerous levels while the economy shrinked at the same time and were only going to add more debt without cutting any expenses or encouraging new business. I personally think that business-positive government is a very good thing and apparently so do most of the happy finnish voters.\n\n          &gt;&gt;  &quot;taking from the poor, giving to the rich&quot; and a xenophobic agenda\n&gt;\n&gt; Quite strong words. This sounds very much like your personal opinion instead of a fact.<p>Yes, strong words. In my opinion it&#x27;s the worst government as long as I have followed Finnish politics. A vice prime minister who wants to shoot foreigners, that would not be acceptable in many Western democracies. (Yes, the statement is old and she might have written it only to get political supporters. But for me neither of them is an excuse.)<p>Just read any newspaper:<p>* Next month social benefits will be cut and more cuts are in preparation<p>* Unemployed foreigners will lose their permits and have to leave their country after a short time. Not yet decided, but the original plan was 3 months.<p>* The possibility for seeking political asylum can be suspended for 30 days (draft by the ministry)<p>That&#x27;s what I call taking from the poor and the weak.<p>Despite that everybody agrees that the public debt is growing too fast, the government insists on lowering taxes (not drastically, but still) instead of raising them as the situation would require.<p>That&#x27;s what I call giving to the rich.<p>The new government is growing the debt even further already according to current budget. And typically the budget is too optimistic, in reality it might come worse. I would not call that understanding economic principles, it&#x27;s pure ideology that taxes must not be raised and benefits of the rich must not be touched.<p>&gt; apparently so do most of the happy finnish voters.<p>The results were pretty unclear. Several government coalitions would have been possible. The winner did not want to compromise, but move to the right as far as they could.<p>If there were a election today, the Finns Party would lose quite a bit. Many of their voters are affected by the cuts and not happy.<p>So claiming that this government has a strong backing is a bit of an exaggeration. It does not help that they repeat it. They won the last election, but that&#x27;s it.\n\n    &quot;Happiness&quot; is being confused with &quot;contentment&quot; or &quot;basic satisfaction&quot;.\n\n    Finnish public discussion is often very critical of Finland. People keep comparing Finland to other countries and complaining how some specific thing is worse than in country X. That&#x27;s probably a key reason Finland ranks so high here.<p>Happiness, when measured at population level, doesn&#x27;t mean intense emotions. It doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone is visibly happy. It means that people are generally content with their lives, because nothing is particularly wrong for most people.<p>If you look at the country rankings, all the usual suspects rank high: the Nordic countries, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Whenever you rank countries by some measure of success or quality of life, you expect to see those countries near the top. All of them are wealthy and not too large, and they all have a culture where the people in charge generally try to make things right. It doesn&#x27;t always look like that from the inside, but when you compare them to the rest of the world, it&#x27;s pretty clear why they are so successful. Especially if you try to measure success by the quality of life experienced by the middle 80% of the population.\n\n    &gt; How does that lead to rank 1?<p>Because none of the items you mentioned affect happiness or the perceived life of the people in Finland.  The vast majority won&#x27;t and don&#x27;t know people who commit suicide, murder or die from drugs.  People may grumble about bus strikes but are mostly are happy with and trust public services, transport, police, press and government.  And feel safe they won&#x27;t be destitute even if lose their job.<p>BTW Finland doesn&#x27;t have a far right government - there&#x27;s a right wing party (which has shelved its anti-eu policies) as part of the government coalition.  The proportional representation perhaps makes people feel less disenfranchised and &#x27;happier&#x27;.\n\n      &gt; The vast majority won&#x27;t and don&#x27;t know people who commit suicide,<p>That part I seriously doubt. I personally know of 2 suicides in the last 20 years. Not people that were close in any way, but people I had met. (Like the brother of the best friend of my wife or a classmate of my daughter.) One more accident where suicide is suspected to be the real reason by many. There are probably not many Finns with no relative who died from the consequences of alcoholism.<p>I would claim everybody should know someone suffering&#x2F;having suffered from depression or other mental health problems.<p>And I have witnessed one suicide, which was not a pleasant view (that might be more of bad luck, probably fewer people have)\n\n        &gt; There are probably not many Finns with no relative who died from the consequences of alcoholism.<p>Suicide is 1 per 7500 people - so I still think most people won&#x27;t really know someone, but might know of, or have met.<p>But yes, if suicide included people who &quot;drank themselves to death&quot; or who had fatal accidents when drunk, or killed someone while drunk, close to everyone (including me) would know someone\n\n  One that I question is UK at 20... There is so much news about various economic pressures there that it is surprising to find it ranking so high.\n\n    This was doing the news rounds recently &#x27;UK second most miserable country&#x27; so surely something doesnt add up.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economictimes.indiatimes.com&#x2F;nri&#x2F;latest-updates&#x2F;uk-is-officially-the-worlds-second-most-miserable-country-these-were-the-happiest-and-unhappiest-countries-of-2023&#x2F;articleshow&#x2F;108361220.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economictimes.indiatimes.com&#x2F;nri&#x2F;latest-updates&#x2F;uk-i...</a>\n\n      John Oliver would very likely comment that the British are truly happy being miserable.\n\n        I can confirm that us Brits do like to have a good old whinge ;) A national trait that&#x27;s for sure. Personally, I don&#x27;t notice people whinging quite as much as they did as when I was younger, I feel possibly we&#x27;ve absorbed a bit of the American positive thinking mentality. But certainly wonder how this shows itself on surveys. Its quite possible that Brits when asked in a survey, say their life is &quot;s**&quot; then having had the fantastic privilege that day, of whinge-ing in a survey as well as to anyone around them who fancies listening, they go on their merry way, quite cheerful for having told someone extra how terrible everything is. ;)\n\n          Yeah, there was a reason you lot got dubbed whinging poms ;)<p>It&#x27;s endearing.<p>Slice of history: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kXfq1zCVhA0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kXfq1zCVhA0</a>\n\n    Imagine how unhappy we’d be if we had nothing to grumble about.\n\n    But its not all about economic pressure, right? Poor countries with high sense of community and looking out for one another, are often happy. As for the UK, I heard the stats suggest older people are happy while younger people and teenagers in particular are not. My personal belief, as a Brit, is while social media probably doesn&#x27;t help, a big reason for unhappy teenagers is that secondary schools have been effectively privatised. They&#x27;re run by &quot;Academy chains&quot; - essentially big business , which pushes teenagers very hard to have high attendance rate , come to school when ill, push them to do well on exams. Not actually learn useful things, but learn how to game the system to get the high scores. Its very corporate, and ultimately about maintaining the image of the corporation not the well-being of teenagers. One can dispute this, and say other stuff is upsetting teenagers e:g news about wars and climate breakdown, but &quot;twas ever thus&quot; e:g my Mum was preparing for O-level exams (yesterday&#x27;s GCSEs) during Cuban Missile crisis. People point at economic issues but that&#x27;s very inconsistent - there are some teenagers in poverty, some rich, some in the middle, we&#x27;re a divided society that&#x27;s for sure.\n\n  How does Israel and Kuwait rank so high ? Did they surveyed the arab israelis and Palestinians? What about those slave workers in Kuwait ? In both case that&#x27;s more than half the total population that lives in horrible conditions.<p>Makes this whole Ranking suspicious\n\n    - Israelis have a well-known reality-distortion field as regards their well being.\n- The Palestinian population, de facto subjects of the Israeli state, are most probably not included.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m an Israeli expat.\n\n    All these studies are self-reported happiness (basically, many people answering the question &quot;How happy do you feel today?&quot;). Israel ranks high because large parts of the population — the religious ones, with not a lot of income but many children and a strong sense of fulfillment — are regularly and steadily self-reporting high levels of happiness.<p>(This relates to both Jewish and Muslim citizens of Israel.)<p>Your (or mine, or anyone&#x27;s) view of their conditions don&#x27;t have much influence on their everyday feelings.<p>&gt; Makes this whole Ranking suspicious<p>There&#x27;s nothing too suspicious about asking many people in different countries are they feeling happy on this particular day. If anything, what&#x27;s looking suspicious is the premise that high levels of GDP (for whatever that means) would result in more happiness of the people.\n\n  That&#x27;s the &quot;Life Evaluation&quot; list, there are other criteria as well if you look at the full report...<p>Large differences between age groups as well, as the report states:<p>&gt;  Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain are countries where the old are now significantly happier than the young, while Portugal and\nGreece show the reverse pattern.\n\n  For those who prefer a full list, more discussion, and the original source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldhappiness.report\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldhappiness.report</a>\n\nThis is a democratic worry: unhappy people are pliable people and are more likely to vote for demagogues, demagogues who are more a wrecking ball than a manager of state.\n\n  &gt; &quot;unhappy people are pliable people and are more likely to vote for demagogues, demagogues who are more a wrecking ball than a manager of state&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a stilted and verbose euphemism for &quot;voting against the status quo.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t that expected when people are allowed to vote and when the status quo fails them?<p>&gt; This is a democratic worry<p>No, not being allowed to vote for change shows that democracy is absent.\n\n    The concern is not that people want change or that they vote for change per se but that the change comes in the form of a person or persons who destroy the freedom to vote for change.  This is more likely to happen during times of discontent.<p>Falling happiness ought to be a concern for any political system that seeks to enhance the society.\n\n  You say that as a bad thing, others see it as a good thing. Like with everything, we eventually revert to a happy and &quot;flowing&quot; medium. People being unhappy means their needs and worries were not being catered.\n\n    This is obviously not true if you look at the current state and history of many countries in the world.\n\n    Sometimes that takes many hundreds of years (see Russia)\n\n    Your word choice of &quot;catered&quot; in reference to meeting the needs of people is interesting. Do you feel that suffering is part of being a citizen?<p>Needs are not something to be &quot;catered&quot; to, but met with reasonable effort, and the US, so far as I can tell, is failing on that front, and has been for decades, regardless of red or blue leadership.<p>Nobody is asking for handouts, just the ability to afford a home and groceries with an appropriate wage. Sorry to be pedantic, and I certainly agree with your sentiment, but we need to watch our language in this discussion since I firmly believe that is part of why the subject matter is so divisive.\n\n      I re-read my post just now, and I may have worded it funny with the use of the word &quot;catered&quot;, but I did mean it in a blanket sense as it applies to needs and worries.<p>So for their needs, they&#x27;re not being met with reasonable effort. I&#x27;d even argue that some needs are not even being considered.<p>Likewise, for their worries, they&#x27;re not being taken into consideration. E.g. If people are worried about immigration, address it. Or if people are worried about student debt, also do something. But don&#x27;t let politicians ignore it entirely while talking incessantly that it needs to be fixed.<p>This is why I&#x27;m a huge proponent of direct-democracy, or any sort of more directed form of democracy other than representative. People recently have been correctly realizing that &quot;democracy&quot; is not as noble or actually as representative as they&#x27;ve been told since birth.<p>Side note, I think government&#x2F;politicians&#x2F;TPTB&#x2F;etc are using &quot;Democracy&quot; as a way to have their cake and eat it. It&#x27;s very difficult for peoples needs&#x2F;worries to be address in government, they&#x27;re always somehow mediated or ignored with the common excuse being party-lines, lack of bipartisan support, or just &quot;hey it&#x27;s those evil guys over there&quot;. But at the same time, we&#x27;re told that it&#x27;s &quot;okay&quot; because don&#x27;t worry, this is democracy and it&#x27;s just the will of the people.<p>I call BS. If it&#x27;s the will of the people, we&#x27;d be 100% okay with doing referendums left right and centre on every contentious issue tomorrow.<p>&#x2F;rant. Sorry that turned into a bit of a tangential rant.\n\n    Alternative explanation would be quite different: once people have their needs and worries taken care of, they immediately think of new needs. These new needs are (naturally) not being catered (yet), so people feel unhappy. Once these are catered, new ones are created.<p>If my neighbours have a car but I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m unhappy. If I get a car, I&#x27;m unhappy since my neighbours have an SUV. Once I get an SUV, I&#x27;m unhappy since they have one with climate control, power windows, roof window, and navigation. Rinse, repeat.<p>This explanation talks more about what we humans are as a species, and less about government etc.\n\n  Hopefully we get good and hard the democracy that we have long been promised; and good and hard because you only get an outcome that people whose lives have been utterly and entirely unlike your own are the ones making the rules for how you and yours will be to the end of your days. Sounds like a lot of fun right? It sure is interesting how people&#x27;s opinions change when they realize what kind of people are the ones getting to make the rules for everybody from here on out.\n\nBetween the homeless camps, the thousand yard stare retail workers, the perpetually angry boomer ruling class, the isolating physical environments, the destruction of third spaces, the medical bankruptcies, the lack of any kind of sick leave or vacation, the death race daily commutes,  i thought this was pretty obvious\n\n  You forgot the lack of affordable housing, which is my guess as to why youth happiness fell so sharply in the US and Germany and France.\n\n  Americans may finally start to realize they are not &quot;temporarily embarrassed millionaires&quot;\n\n    If you look at the &quot;Explained By Six Factors&quot; sections:<p>2023: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.tableau.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;worldhappinessreport&#x2F;viz&#x2F;WorldHappinessReport2023&#x2F;Figure2_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.tableau.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;worldhappinessreport&#x2F;...</a><p>2024: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.tableau.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;worldhappiness&#x2F;viz&#x2F;2024Draft&#x2F;Figure2_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.tableau.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;worldhappiness&#x2F;viz&#x2F;20...</a><p>it appears that the biggest change for the US has been in the &quot;dystopia + residual&quot; factor, which implies to me that americans indeed reported closer to the model prediction in 2024 than in 2023.\n\n  Pipe down, let&#x27;s not get HN cancelled by act of Congress.\n\nUp next: lots of articles about how happiness isn&#x27;t that important anyway.\n\n  Until November of this year, at which time Trump&#x27;s forthcoming inauguration will retroactively be deemed the cause of why the US dipped in the happiness ranking earlier in the year\n\nDirect link  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;WHR+24.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;WHR+24.pdf</a>\n\nThe dog that’s not barking is state by state data from the US, or from within parts of other large nations.\n\nAs a Brit who lived in the US a few years so maybe has a detached perspective.. I saw Americans being happy in a land of opportunity with high personal freedom, opportunity to reinvent yourself, the great outdoors etc, and certainly I enjoyed that too. OTOH, individualism has its dark side. When people believe its all about self-determination and the state shouldn&#x27;t be helping people, some people fall massively through the cracks e:g someone on low income while they try to look after a disabled family member. Americans are often generous at helping each other, in fact ironically I found those that supported economically right-wing &quot;everyone should pull themselves up by their bootstraps&quot; ideology, could often be simultaneously generous to others that they perceived to be in need. I think a source of unhappiness in the USA might be loneliness. To be honest, reading Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Little house on the prairie&quot; series, while that sounds idyllic in a way, it also sounds lonely and hard work to me. So, some sources of lower happiness in the USA in terms of lack of community, might be deep-rooted?  (some off the top of my head thoughts which others may dispute :). )\n\n  That doesn&#x27;t account for why things have got worse.\n\n    But has it actually got worse? ;) I mean, yes in recent times, according to the methodology used by these academics, specifically relative to other countries. But that&#x27;s pretty specific. As others said, maybe other countries have improved relatively?  What&#x27;s the take-away form all this?  To me, loneliness is the biggest issue. We can all deal with a lot of cr*p in our lives if we&#x27;ve got supportive friends, and we can all be much happier by helping others who need it . Its very satisfying.\n\n      &gt; But has it actually got worse?<p>US life expectancy is going down, so yeah some things really are getting worse. Life expectancy is going up in almost all other countries.\n\nRecently learned about the existence of the Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weall.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weall.org&#x2F;</a>\n\nCountless metrics have been proposed over time to track <i>wellbeing</i> of some type. The recent WISE initiative [1] tries to put some structure around this (using current welfare, future welfare and inclusiveness as key dimensions).<p>Despite this lack of sharpness and unassailable objectivity, the signal sent by all these metrics is generally real: the focus on aggregate economic performance (the infamous GDP) and organizing society entirely around the maximization of monetarily defined wealth is too simplistic, no longer fit-for-purpose (if it ever was) and potentially a complete cul-de-sac.<p>The list of &quot;happy&quot; countries is more or less the set where various intangible cultural aspects partially mitigate the growing inadequacy of the mainstream socioeconomic apparatus. But it is not a blueprint that can be easily adopted or improved upon by other countries and cultures.<p>Yet there are no visible paths to workable alternatives (or complements) to the existing system. The simplicity of mapping everything onto a single monetary dimension has been such a successful monopoly and created incredibly strongly entrenched interests. It has left effectively no room for evolving any other broad-based economic infrastructure or tools that might expand what we optimize for to things that evidently matter.<p>People are frustrated and compile this or that index or meta-index but the expression &quot;put money where your mouth is&quot; neatly expresses the current impasse.

I.e. &quot;on a scale of 1 to 5, how happy do you feel today?&quot;. And this is exactly what this study does.<p>The real issue is that GDP (a concept which is too complicated to be understood by general populace), or any other &quot;economic performance&quot; criterion, have little to no relation to the self-perceived happiness of the population. Objectively poor people can be happy, and objectively rich people can be unhappy.\n\nmy brain hit a buffer overflow at position 5 and I stopped reading."

If we found a new material that looked a lot like asbestos under a microscope, you&#x27;d presumably limit your exposure to it until proven safe?\n\n      Yes, prenantal exposure to hormones is one thing but I was specifically referring to GP&#x27;s frankly controversial implicit claim that gay men possess lower T.<p>Anyway if I recall correctly that research suggests that <i>higher</i> prenantal T exposure increases likelihood of homosexuality, the opposite of what stereotypes might suggest\n\n    Its the opposite of what you may think. High T makes you more sexual and less inhibited. Many, many, many, many people turn to the dark side after using anabolic steroids. Even if they don&#x27;t become full Sith masters, they often still like to dabble in dark side of Thailand.\n\n  Will you have to stay on the shots forever or are you doing things in conjunction to stay at good levels (if so, what? Sounds like your lifestyle was already healthy)\n\n    To reap the benefits of TRT yes, but switching off means I just return to baseline.\n\n      With regular TRT shots, I&#x27;ve heard that there is a possibility that the baseline will lower due to changes in the HPG axis, leading to decreased production of LH and FSH, which leads to less testosterone being signaled to be naturally produced.\n\n        Taking extregenious testosterone disables your natural production. If you want to fire it back up you&#x27;ll need to take hcg or clomid as post cycle therapy.<p>When on TRT, the naturally produced stuff is for all intents and purposes useless because you will be shooting up plenty that any extra will probably aromatise into estrogen anyway.\n\n  Meh. I had he same blood work results as a 35 year old 4 years ago. I was &quot;healthy&quot; and exercising every day and eating &quot;healthy&quot;.<p>Turns out running 8 miles every day and not eating over 100g of protein and not having enough fat KILLS your hormones because you&#x27;re always in a catabolic state.<p>Now I only lift heavy, fixed my macros, get better sleep, focus on muscle mass, and DON&#x27;T need TRT. My natural T levels tripled in only 2 years.<p>Some biased ideas of &quot;healthy&quot; are not optimal.\n\n    Can you expand a bit? Seems very interesting...<p>How do you manage to keep 100g of protein daily?<p>What is fixing macros?<p>How do you know you were in catabolic state, were you constantly loosing weight?\n\n  Can you define what you consider a &quot;very healthy diet&quot;?\n\n    Breakfast is a protein shake of casein and collagen protein. With added berries in water. Oatmeal and a glass of coffee.<p>Lunch is a can of cooked chicken breast, 2 cups of fat free Greek yogurt , and a small salad with olive oil and vinegar.<p>Dinner is typically whatever my wife decides to make. She&#x27;s Greek so a lot of Greek and Mediterranean food. Salads at every meal.\n\n      Try to drink coffee away from meals, caffeine &amp; tannins in coffee interfere with minerals, protein and lipid absorption. The same applies to tea.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;8360789&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;8360789&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;6402915&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;6402915&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0002916522026983?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S000291652...</a>\n\n  &gt; It&#x27;s death by a thousand cuts with all of these chemicals out there that turn friggin frogs gay poisoning us.<p>I hope that statement is a joke and just reference to that insane Alex Jones clip. But if it&#x27;s not, no amount of estrogenic compounds will turn you gay. Otherwise MTF folks would be universally straight after taking hormone therapy.\n\n    Reference to Alex Jones.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think the term &quot;gay&quot; is particularly well defined for amphibians. Frogs do change sex though[1]. Whether or not exposure to exogenous estrogenic compounds triggers that I do not know.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;animals&#x2F;article&#x2F;frogs-reverse-sex-more-often-than-thought\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;animals&#x2F;article&#x2F;frogs-rev...</a>\n\n  The following is not intended as advice for you, because I don&#x27;t want to make assumptions about your healthcare situation (and you didn&#x27;t ask me for advice). However I&#x27;m sharing it here in case it&#x27;s helpful to others in whom you may have aroused curiosity.<p>Exogenous testosterone supplementation induces potentially permanent primary hypogonadism in patients that don&#x27;t already have it. It can also eventually more or less completely atrophy the testes. Those effects can be partially counteracted by additional drugs, cycling, and so on, but those approaches have their own problems.<p>Some doctors want to go straight to testosterone supplementation, but I would insist on first eliminating secondary hypogonadism as a cause of low serum testosterone. See a good urologist or endocrinologist who will work with you to figure out root cause to the extent possible. There are treatments for secondary hypogonadism that will restore testosterone to very high levels in individuals with healthy testes.\n\n    Yes this is a concern of mine which is why I am dosing 100IU of HCG as a preventative to this.\n\n  &gt;Guys (and maybe girls), get a full blood panel done that shows you the exact numbers of lipid, testosterone , and estrogen in your body.<p>It&#x27;s probably just as much of a concern for females as for males. The idea of &quot;estrogen&quot; as &quot;the female hormone&quot; is a significant oversimplification.\n\nAnother great reason to become a regular blood donor. I recall reading that the only way to remove these forever substances from your blood was through donations. My wife and I go every 3 months.\n\n  I was surprised to learn that a full blood donation (500ml) is about 10% of all of the blood in the body.\n\n    I was surprised that you cannot donate less than a pint of blood. I wanted to donate but that put me off, one pint is too much lost blood in one sitting. I wonder why these restrictions and why not allow people to donate half of that for example. Is it just for convenience for blood collectors?\n\n      &gt; I wanted to donate but that put me off, one pint is too much lost blood in one sitting.<p>What do you mean?\n\n      Off the top of my head, I imagine blood bag sizes are standardized, so they&#x27;re easy to deal with during an emergency transfusion.<p>It would be a nightmare to deal with containers with mixed volumes of blood. &quot;This patient needs 3 litres of O-, let me figure out which combination of blood bags do I need now&quot;\n\n        Donated blood is not used directly like that.<p>It is indeed tested and mixed.<p>That&#x27;s why they ask so many questions about your risk of disease when donating.\n\n          I didn&#x27;t know it was mixed, thanks for the clarification. I guess it makes sense to mix it.\n\n      It&#x27;s because blood bags are typically pre-filled with a measured dose of an anticoagulant to increase how long the blood can be stored. If they&#x27;re only partially filled there will be too much anticoagulant for the volume of blood.<p>I believe the most common anticoagulant used today is Citrate Phosphate Dextrose Adenine Solution (CPDA-1), which doesn&#x27;t have a Wikipedia page, but it&#x27;s mentioned on the page for the the older acid-citrate-dextrose:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Acid-citrate-dextrose\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Acid-citrate-dextrose</a><p>However, I agree that volumes of blood per donation (which varies by country) are sometimes so big that it probably discourages many potential donors. It&#x27;s possible that demanding such a large quantity from each donor reduces the total amount of blood donated.\n\n      You do you, but I&#x27;m pretty athletic, donate blood frequently, and have never really noticed any degradation in my athletic performance the day after a donation. Unless you have some medical condition, the standard amount is no big deal.\n\n  Ive never done it and the whole thing grosses me out so much id probably pass out. but reading about this lately im honestly considering it. at the same time it makes me wonder i never was interested in donating blood for greater good but now im motivated to get rid of any pfas... so someone else can take them up?\n\n    Why do you find donating blood gross?\n\n  So the solution is to give it to someone else?\n\n    the recipients have bigger problems than PFAS, so it is a win-win deal\n\n    The sollution to pollution is dilution. (half joking)<p>If you go regularly the concentration of PFAS in your donated blood would be lower compared to going more sporadically.\n\n      See also<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medicalxpress.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024-02-danish-drug-chemicals-blood.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medicalxpress.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024-02-danish-drug-chemicals...</a><p>for a drug that appears to lower PFAS levels.  I&#x27;d be concerned about where the PFAS is partitioned in the body:  giving blood isn&#x27;t going to make a big difference if most of the PFAS is in your fat.\n\n  For anyone else interested in reading more: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamanetworkopen&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2790905\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamanetworkopen&#x2F;fullarticle...</a>\n\n  Who would have thought bloodletting[1] would make a comeback.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bloodletting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bloodletting</a>\n\n  If the problem gets worse perhaps there&#x27;s another solution. Like kidney patients on dialysis, we all could soon be lining up for PFAS and perhaps nano plastics dialysis.\n\n  It&#x27;s really too bad that I faint when I go through something involving needles, veins and blood.\n\n    I don&#x27;t faint but I get super weird and blood slows to a trickle. But I think I need to try again.\n\n      My nervous system just short circuits from the idea of blood draw&#x2F;donation. I start shaking, get super tense, and white out in a minute or so. Also, my veins are not super visible which makes the experience super tense.<p>It&#x27;s something that I can&#x27;t control, and is miserable for everyone involved.\n\n        Lol, I feel like I&#x27;m very similar reaction-wise. My veins are massive though. I tried once and had to call it off within a minute. I want to try looking away. I seem to function better if I look away.\n\n  but some plasma machines from Haemonetics contaminated donors and plasma with micro particulates<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basta.media&#x2F;don-de-sang-plaquettes-plasma-particules-cancerigenes-Haemonetics-lanceurs-d-alerte-ministere-de-la-sante\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basta.media&#x2F;don-de-sang-plaquettes-plasma-particules...</a>\n\n  It&#x27;s also good for getting heavy metals out of the blood too.\n\nit&#x27;s everywhere, recycled plastic is even worse<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;dangerous-chemicals-found-in-recycled-plastics-making-them-unsafe-for-use-experts-explain-the-hazards-220498\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;dangerous-chemicals-found-in-rec...</a><p>And paper-cups and straws are lined with the stuff and aren&#x27;t recycleable<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scienceswitch.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;90-of-eco-friendly-paper-straws-contain-traces-of-toxic-forever-chemicals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scienceswitch.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;90-of-eco-friendly-pape...</a>\n\n  I stopped using paper straws after having read this stuff on HN.<p>Thanks HN commenters :)\n\n    <i>&quot;...Paper Straws Contain Traces of Toxic Forever Chemicals&quot;</i><p>Good idea, but what are you going to use instead? As plastic ones are out, that only leaves glass and perhaps bamboo straws. I know they exist as I&#x27;ve seen them (but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a glass one in decades).<p>Unfortunately, from my recollection, glass straws are inconvenient and can be dangerous if broken.<p>Frankly, I reckon it&#x27;s hopeless, between nano plastics and PFAS I can&#x27;t possibly conceive how I can effectively eliminate them from my life.\n\n      Unless it&#x27;s a disability&#x2F;accessibility reason, consider not using straws at all?\n\n        I don&#x27;t.\n\n      Stainless straws with silicone tips are durable and safe to use!\n\n        For now...\n\n        Right, I&#x27;ve not seen stainless ones before (perhaps I have but it never registered—I never use straws, haven&#x27;t since I was a kid).\n\n        Not exactly true.

Was this controlled for?  How about BMI?\n\n  The paper is available, so feel free to check yourself. BMI was taken into account. Fast food I do not see, but where did you read about this association?\n\n    At the end of February this year the FDA banned PFAS in food packaging which was prevalent especially in paper products which held greasy food.  If you ate a bunch of French fries there was a good chance you were exposed to a significant amount of extra PFAS. This study could be finding a correlation between diet and PFAS exposure and nothing more.  I’m not saying it is but if not corrected for the signal is suspect.\n\n    I do not have a link, but have read it in multiple journals.<p>The MAO is entirely plausible.  Many fast food wrappers are lined with PFAS because of its temperature stability and hydrophobic properties.  At high temperatures these coatings also leech the coating.\n\n  <i>&quot;Fast food consumption is also associated with both&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not arguing the point here but why would fast food have more PFAS in it? Seems these days all food is grown under conditions and goes through similar handling before it gets to customers.\n\n    Paper straws and paper wrapping, cartons and so on are lined with PFAS. Paper isn&#x27;t waterproof so to get the green credentials they coat it with PFAS.<p>That cheeseburger wrapper, feels waxy doesn&#x27;t it? That&#x27;s PFAS.\n\n      Right. However, traditional pre-WWII greaseproof paper didn&#x27;t contain them (as that was before organo-fluorine chemistry was commonplace), and it worked pretty well. Why not simply revert to that?<p>It may not be as efficient as paper laced with PFAS but it would certainly be good enough.\n\n    Many fast food wrappers&#x2F;containers contained PFAS until very recently [0].  Putting hot food out of a fryer into those containers would leech some of the PFAS into the food.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;pfas-forever-chemicals-fast-food-wrappers-fda-234b4d2ebb9ee1eed30006c24ff6f450\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;pfas-forever-chemicals-fast-food-...</a>\n\n      Yeah right, no doubt true. But similarly I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d be also true for many household kitchen containers that are made of plastic.<p>I know some HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) containers have been found to contain PFAS, so it would be safe to assume those that are still in use in my kitchen also contain them but I&#x27;ve no simple way of telling for sure. But it&#x27;s safe to assume the worst.<p>Also I use lots of large HDPE storage boxes to store everything from old papers and documents to tools and I&#x27;ve a long-term complaint about them in that they sweat their plasticizers and that has practical implications as it shortens their useful life.<p>Whenever a year or two later I rummage around looking something stored in the boxss I notice that they&#x27;ve developed a sort of greasy film on them like one would expect to find had they&#x27;d been stored in a kitchen where one does lots of frying.<p>So unless they&#x27;re stored in a clean pristine place—which is impractical where I live—they&#x27;ll collect dust that simply cannot be just brushed off as the dust mixes with the oil-like plasticizer. So every now and then I&#x27;ll clean them by spraying them with a household cleaner that&#x27;s a soapy surfactant then rinse them. I&#x27;m unaware exactly what plasticizers are used and or whether they contain significant amounts of PFAS.<p>However, over time, as the plasticizers leach out, the polyethylene goes a slight yellowish color and becomes very brittle, and it&#x27;s commonplace for me to replace them. When old, they&#x27;ll easily break open if stacked too high or if accidentally dropped.<p>To put it bluntly, I&#x27;m damn sick of having to clean and replace them all too frequently. The old ones end up wherever trash collectiors dump them (even if I put them with plastic recycling I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re still likely to end up in landfill where they&#x27;ll continue to leach plasticizer, FFAS etc. not to mention fragment into nano plastic particles and spread into the environment).<p>There are much better more durable plastics available than polyethylene that are much less likely to leach, and if used to make boxes and similar stuff it would make them much more rugged and durable, they could then last indefinitely—50+ years or more.<p>Trouble is manufacturers don&#x27;t want people to keep stuff indefinitely, they just want people to buy more.<p>I reckon this problem can only be fixed by legislation. The sooner the better.\n\n    It seems food packaging is at fault here [1], and fast food has much more individually wrapped items, small ketchup bags, and even before preparation often is single-portioned. Meaning insane amounts of touching packaging material compared to real food.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consumerreports.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;food-contaminants&#x2F;dangerous-pfas-chemicals-are-in-your-food-packaging-a3786252074&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consumerreports.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;food-contaminants&#x2F;dan...</a>\n\n    The switch from plastic to &quot;biodegradable&quot; materials for food packaging will probably be shown to be a grave mistake in the future. Natural cardboard will quickly loose it&#x27;s strength if exposed to hot oily food, so they are usually coated with materials to prevent that.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;envirobites.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-problem-with-pfas-how-your-biodegradable-coffee-cup-might-be-wreaking-havok-in-the-compost-bin&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;envirobites.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-problem-with-pfas-how...</a><p>I also suspect PFAS or similar coatings are used on paper cups to aid separation when stacked.<p>A few years ago I visited a Burger King in Spain and the cups have a strange slimy feel, which felt similar to when you get PTFE spray on your hands (good as a lubricant where you don&#x27;t want it to spread to nearby parts like oil).\n\n      <i>&quot;Natural cardboard will quickly loose it&#x27;s strength if exposed to hot oily food,...&quot;</i><p>I know, I&#x27;ve experienced the problem of disintegrating containers myself many times. That said, I believe that for many applications there are either existing solutions that are practical and still offer PFAS-type performance that won&#x27;t disadvantage people too much or that new chemistry can be developed that&#x27;s much more environmentally friendly. As I mentioned above in my previous reply traditional greaseproof paper doesn&#x27;t contain PFAS so why not use it? It&#x27;s suitable for food preparation and delivery. However it&#x27;s not suitable for everything and other alternatives to PFAS have to be found.<p>It seems to me that chemistry might hiding even better solutions. I&#x27;m not a professional chemist but I&#x27;ve studied the subject more years than I care to remember, so I&#x27;m not going to offer a neat solution to the problem here, (anyway, if I had one I&#x27;d have patented it and I&#x27;d be rich). :-)<p>When previously confronted with these types of problems chemists have applied themselves and have often found suitable solutions. After all, that&#x27;s a major aspect of chemical engineering. Moreover, I&#x27;d be very surprised if there aren&#x27;t existing solutions that are more environmentally friendly already available. It&#x27;s finding them and making the switch that&#x27;s difficult. That said, new chemicals will have to be engineered for specific applications.<p>Whether PFAS-type chemicals can be modified to break down more easily is moot, as the carbon-fluorine bond is extremely strong and not much can touch it for strength, but there are other molecules that are potentially suitable—that is, ones that can be easily converted into materials that are initially impermeable to water, oils and grease but breakdown after suitably long exposure to water, bacteria etc.<p>At first guess I&#x27;d be looking at reexamining cellulose as the basis for developing better materials but no doubt there are many others that would be suitable. It&#x27;s a natural material that&#x27;s readily available from wood and plant matter and it&#x27;s environmentally friendly, and we understand its chemistry. We already make cellophane from it which is impervious to water and oils but it will still break down upon extended exposure (one of the reasons for why cellophane isn&#x27;t used more often is that it lacks long-term durability; that wasn&#x27;t seen as a vitrue but it&#x27;s now a property that we actually want).<p>Previously, cellulose and cellulose-type plastics such as cellophane and celluloid were bypassed in favor of oil-based plastics specifically because they weren&#x27;t as durable as the latter, but in the light of the PFAS-forever chemicals problem I&#x27;d reckon a reexamination of their chemistry would seem in order. We need to start researching them and other suitable ones again.<p>A quick and rather oversimplified way of looking at what&#x27;s needed to replace PFAS is to think about how soap and detergents work. We start with an oil which is hard to break down partly because it&#x27;s hydrophobic and hates mixing with water which would help towards breaking it down. To tame its hydrophobic tendencies we attach water-loving hydrophilic OH (hydroxyl) groups to its molecules which they accept only under considerable duress.<p>Luckily, it turns out that this brual attack hasn&#x27;t destroyed the oil molecules completely, rather they&#x27;ve metamorphosed—saponified—into a sort of schizophrenic &#x27;hybrid&#x27; compound that exhibits both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. Now one part of this new &#x27;hybrid&#x27; retains its affinity for oils whilst its &#x27;attachment&#x27; happily joins with water. Thus, the oily end will still grab grease on your plate whilst its new hydroxyl part allows water to wash the whole mess away. Applying such a process to forever chemicals such as PFAS is extremely difficult if not impossible because of the extremely tough organo-fluorine bond.<p>What we need to do is to develop a suitable range of compounds that have properties somewhere between the extremely strong bonds exhibited by PFAS and those that can couple easily with water and or other common compounds that are suitable, this will allow them to be broken down into harmless environmentally friendly byproducts.<p>Nevertheless, we still want control over the breakdown process, that is we need to design chemicals that initially resist being broken down so they are actually useful and do what we want but eventually succumb to being broken down after a suitable duration when we&#x27;re finished using them.<p>I believe that this not beyond the capability of modern chemical engineering. As I see it, the main problem is that there&#x27;s a huge well established industry out there with lots of existing infrastructure that&#x27;s standing in the way. It&#x27;s been used to manufacturing and using forever chemicals for a very long time, thus it has inertia and will inherently resist change; moreover, making the change to more friendly alternatives will likely come at considerable cost.<p>And that&#x27;s the crux of the matter.\n\n  Fast food is also full of PFAS.\n\n  in the study the confounding factors adjusted for are &quot;certain risk behaviors (alcohol consumption, smoking), obesity and lipid-lowering medication&quot; and they &quot;generally decreased the strength of and number of significant associations, but did not substantially change the overall patterns&quot;."

It absolutely is protected speech.<p>Your test sentence fails the Brandenburg test: it is not &quot;directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action&quot;, nor &quot;likely to incite or produce such action.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;brandenburg_test\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;brandenburg_test</a>\n\n        Thankfully, the US system does not agree with you.\n\n        True threats are illegal.<p>However, &quot;go kill ni*ers for a high score&quot; is not only not a true threat, it&#x27;s the kind of speech that Brandenburg v Ohio, which established the current incitement-to-imminent-lawless-action test, <i>explicitly</i> said was 100% protected free speech.<p>Pretty much anything <i>less</i> than leading a mob and telling them who is their next lynching target will be ruled protected speech.\n\n  From reading the article, it sounds like what the judge actually ruled is not what the headline seems to claim that the judge ruled.  It seems that the judge is simply saying the case can proceed to the next phase.  The plaintiffs, it appears, still need to argue their claim of product liability.  So they still need to present a case to the court that each of the defendants products are in fact defective.\n\n    I wonder if this is &quot;the disconnection of article and headline&quot; sort of thing.  I&#x27;ve read some article authors have no control over the headlines associated with their writings, either added by someone else, or generated or a&#x2F;b tested or whatever.\n\nProduct Liability lawsuits don&#x27;t get enough discussion time yet, I would like to see more discussion on them.<p>I think it can be beneficial for social media sites and other ventures to collaborate with society more\n\n  I don&#x27;t think software in general faces enough product liability standards.\n\n    I think that&#x27;s more because software is in everything and the product that software is in is what gets the liability as a whole.<p>iirc, the Toyota breaking issue &amp; lawsuit was ultimately a software issue. The code was such a mess that I decided I wouldn&#x27;t buy Toyota again. This was maybe 8-10 years ago\n\nAnd so begins another round of tech company funded shill outlets (hi Mike) and lobbyists convincing everyone that the most valuable companies on the planet must be given absolute immunity for their behavior or else the Internet will collapse... even though that immunity law is only in the US anyways.\n\nWould be interesting to see a similar headline like: &quot;Judge demands FBI prove they didn&#x27;t help radicalize mass shooter&quot;, which is definitely fairly common if measured as a % of terrorist convictions.<p>More to the point of the article: I don&#x27;t understand all these attacks on Section 230. Is there a single reasonable proposal for what kind of framework should replace Section 230?\n\n  The headline is simply a clickbait lie (fairly typical of the source); what the the judge actually ruled is not that liability is assumed and platforms must disprove it,  but that Section 230 is not a bar to a defective product liability claim.\n\n    The problem with that is that the only &quot;product&quot; here is their website.<p>Regulating harmful speech as a &quot;product&quot; seems a bit odd because the product exists only to convey certain speech.  Any device used to convey harmful speech would seem to become subject to liability under this theory, as all claims of how this caused harm seem to be related to conveying speech that lead to harmful beliefs, even if that is dressed up as some product that is a &quot;sophisticated system&quot; for recommending or promoting bad ideas.<p>This becomes an especially thin fig leaf when applied to, e.g., 4chan which doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything like recommending or promoting certain speakers as far as I can tell.\n\n      Calling something a website isn&#x27;t descriptive enough, plenty of websites get shutdown so being a website alone isn&#x27;t enough to qualify as protected speech.<p>4chan and Facebook both are already filtering out Child Porn, they may need to add other categories... or not it&#x27;s an ongoing question.<p>More abstractly I think we can agree a phone network or ISP is a less active participant in what specifically gets said than a recommendation engine.  So an websites internal recommendation engine will ultimately get its own kinds of regulations eventually just like search engines etc.\n\n        Child porn is illegal.  Hate speech, however disgusting, is not.  And FWIW, most of the platforms do their best to filter out both.\n\n          Some hate speech is illegal in the US, it depends on if it’s calling for specific and immediate action or not.\n\n            True threats are a distinct category that may sometimes overlap with hate speech.  But those statements are illegal because they threaten immanent lawless action, not because they&#x27;re hateful.\n\n              True threats are someone saying the speaker  will do something that’s believable.  Ie, Someone claiming they are going to Nuke DC without a nuke fails the standard.  Someone claiming they’re going to shoot you while holding a gun is.<p>So it can be illegal hate speech by inciting people to act without being classified as a true threat.  The triggers being inciting, specific, and immediate aren’t on their own illegal. I can suggest people go to Starbucks and get a coffee without issue.\n\n                The part I was trying to get at is that under current law, true threats are their own category.  Hate speech that is a true threat is illegal, due to being a true threat.  Hate speech that is not a true threat is awful, but legal.<p>So hate speech is not illegal for being hate speech, it&#x27;s only illegal when it&#x27;s also a true threat.  And in that case it&#x27;s illegal because it&#x27;s a true threat.<p>There&#x27;s certainly plenty of overlap, but it doesn&#x27;t help anyone&#x27;s understanding of why it&#x27;s illegal to lump them together or point out that speech can fit in more than one category when only one of the categories is illegal under current US jurisprudence.\n\n      Would that not depend upon how the website works?<p>I&#x27;m fairly certain that any two people going to the same page at the same time on HN will see the same thing. What they see will mostly be determined by the age of a post&#x2F;article along with up&#x2F;down votes by end users. It would be difficult to argue that much is going on here beyond speech.<p>Yet a site like YouTube is different. It will display different content to different people based upon their history (and, likely, other factors). You don&#x27;t even have to be logged into YouTube for this to happen. It is a lot more difficult to argue that this is a form of speech since the recommendations are most likely the product of some optimization algorithm. It certainly isn&#x27;t the product of the direct input of other people.\n\n        &gt; Would that not depend upon how the website works?<p>They&#x27;re suing, among others, 4chan which is the same as HN in that regard and the judge let the lawsuit go forward.<p>So whatever might later be litigated, we can see from this that the plaintiffs currently have a &quot;defective product&quot; theory that HN would also fit if only there were some murderer willing to claim that they were somehow radicalized by HN.\n\n          The defendants (4chan and the others) are independent. It&#x27;s possible 4chan will be found not to be liable (no editorial control exercised in such a way as to create new speech) and the others liable.\n\n            Certainly, but if they had a theory where sites like 4chan (and HN) were excluded, they wouldn&#x27;t have sued them in the first place.\n\n      Note that the judge did not find that any of the websites are products or subject to product liability, only that there is a justiciable dispute of fact on that point. Your argument hinges on facts that are on dispute and on which evidence will be presented later by the parties, at this stage the standard is does the <i>complaint</i> state a cause of action when viewing every disputed fact in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. This is not a ruling on the facts, it is a ruling on whether the filing raises issues for which it is necessary to examine the facts to reach a resolution.\n\n  If a platform wants section 230 protection, then it can&#x27;t use a content display algorithm because  that is editorial control.<p>[edit] I stand corrected.\n\n    That just isn&#x27;t true.\n\n      That&#x27;s what the court is going to determine.\n\n        No, Section 230 does not require providers to not exercise editorial control.  This is a commonly repeated misunderstanding of the law.  There is no room for a court to find GP&#x27;s misstatement in the existing law.\n\n          I&#x27;m very curious. Can you explain more?\n\n            There is no such requirement in Section 230.  What more do you want?\n\n              Thank you for correcting my misconception. I thought it classified them as common carriers.\n\n      Sorry, I should have said this is my opinion. As my sibling mentioned, courts haven&#x27;t tested it yet.\n\n        It&#x27;s good to clearly separate statements about what the law is and what we wish it to be.\n\n    §230 is one of the most misunderstood laws in the US, in large part because of intentional efforts to misconstrue it. What it actually says is that websites are not to be considered the speaker of any user-generated content, and there is explicitly and very intentionally no precondition along the lines of &quot;publisher-platform&quot; or &quot;algorithmic content&quot; or &quot;moderation&quot; or the like.<p>Now, it&#x27;s also the case that moderation and content recommendations themselves are speech on the part of the website--crucially so, for that means they also have First Amendment rights to choose those policies without government coercion. There is an interesting question as to whether it is possible for such speech to create liability independent of the underlying user content (for which §230 absolutely immunizes them); indeed SCOTUS heard a case not long ago to answer this question, only to toss it out because the plaintiffs were uninterested in discussing that question.\n\n      The interesting question is likely (IMO) to be that it can create liability.<p>Selectively picking &amp; ordering the content of others can trivially create new meaning, for example the classic trope of a ransom note formed by clipping words &amp; phrases out of a newspaper &amp; gluing them onto a page. Whether a particular site&#x27;s editorial actions on user content create liability is likely to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Real site&#x27;s algorithmic recommendation systems aren&#x27;t nearly as transformative as newspaper clipping ransom notes, but the sequence and organization of recommended content may well count as a new composite work (much like a music album is a work composed of a sequence of individual tracks) and create liability. I wonder if it would also qualify for individual copyright.\n\n  &gt;which is definitely fairly common if measured as a % of terrorist convictions.<p>Is there any hard, legal record of this? That the FBI radicalized someone?\n\n    2015: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;howthefbicreatedaterrorist&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;howthefbicreatedaterrori...</a><p>2020: (Whitmer kidnapping plot) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Met7X\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Met7X</a><p>2023: (Humzah Mashkoor) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;fbi-agents-groomed-autistic-16-yr-old-to-join-isis-in-entrapment-scheme-then-arrested-him-report&#x2F;9325143&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;fbi-agents-groomed-autistic-16-yr-...</a><p>2023: (Mateo Ventura) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;hb9Im#selection-627.47-627.60\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;hb9Im#selection-627.47-627.60</a>\n\n  Section 230 is being abused by criminal companies who want to have their cake and eat it too.<p>They act as a publisher and algorithmically tailor content to each individual user to increase engagement <i>and</i> still enjoy the protection of S230. Generally this results in noxious, harmful and&#x2F;or illegal content being pushed to the top (as outrage or indignation yields way more engagement).<p>This is far from what S230 was originally meant to protect - content-agnostic communication mediums where the provider is simply facilitating the exchange of user-generated-content without exerting editorial control outside of edge-cases such as spam filtering&#x2F;moderation.\n\nWell, how can you proof that something didn&#x27;t happen?\n\nWhat sort of discount store judge is that?\n\nI think there&#x27;s an interesting line to consider around &#x27;engagement algorithms&#x27; being responsible for accelerating radicalization (i.e. seeing certain content and then push notifications of same&#x2F;similar content get delivered.)<p>The 3rd rail of course, is that to fix <i>that</i> you would likely either enter a &#x27;culture war&#x27; with each side challenging the others, or you just have to go back to a non-engagement tuned way to deliver updates [0].<p>And, you know, it&#x27;s worth some sort of discussion, because I&#x27;ve seen that one mis-click of a youtube video on my phone (trash screen protector) or inebriated TikTok scroll session where it takes me too long to realize it was one form or another of content I didn&#x27;t really care for before switching on, and then it can take up to a month before the pop ups suggesting similar content stop.<p>But, if the algorithm is &#x27;fair&#x27; internally, I would guess the content provider will argue that it is such and, well, sucks this person didn&#x27;t click a &#x27;save the whales&#x27; link instead?<p>To be clear, this is why it is worth a conversation, but it is a difficult one for society for a number of reasons. However I do miss the charm of the &#x27;old web&#x27; where we relied on word of mouth. I think MySpace really was a certain peak of Minimalistic non algo Social media; you picked your sort for who to pay attention to, you could put your links or whatever, toss a song for a mood, and it was simple.<p>On the flip side, something like 4chan is not something, last I checked, that did engagement or anything past &#x27;comment = bump&#x27; (-does- sage even work on it? did it ever?). AFAIK the argument would have to rest to some extent on proving that the mods failed to &#x27;properly&#x27; follow 230... extreme example where they could be in trouble in my mind would be &#x27;a post was reported for a legitimate violent threat and instead of removing&#x2F;locking mods pinned it&#x27;.<p>[0] - you know, when they were nice &#x27;rollups&#x27; of what happened more like your mail vs the modern &#x27;spam&#x27; of each thing, to get you back in the app and ideally tap each one to view so <i>somebody</i> meets an OKR.\n\n  &gt;However I do miss the charm of the &#x27;old web&#x27; where we relied on word of mouth. I think MySpace really was a certain peak of Minimalistic non algo Social media; you picked your sort for who to pay attention to, you could put your links or whatever, toss a song for a mood, and it was simple.<p>This is because back then you only had yourself to rely on to find the content you wanted.<p>Now everybody has to use their algorithms to predict what you want to see, which is terrible.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed in the past couple years is that on any social platform that I admittedly choose to use, all it really takes is clicking something for one topic maybe once or twice and then half my feed is constantly full of it with no way to say &quot;no that was a one-time thing&quot;.\n\n    Even YouTube is bad at this. Think you clicked a game or programming tutorial article and it is actually a link to YouTube? Better not watch if you don&#x27;t like having your recommendations cluttered with videos you&#x27;ll never be interested in.<p>At least with YouTube you can delete items from your watch history, but it&#x27;s a few clicks to get to, so especially annoying for those one-off videos.<p>I really, really wish there was a slightly higher threshold stopping those one-time mistakes from becoming a time sink.\n\n      Turn off your watch history, and only turn it on when you specifically want to.\n\n  &gt; The 3rd rail of course, is that to fix that you would likely either enter a &#x27;culture war&#x27; with each side challenging the others, or you just have to go back to a non-engagement tuned way to deliver updates<p>There is another option, to give users choice and control over the algorithms and content moderation. Bluesky had a recent blog post outlining their Stacked Moderation scheme and open sources project that allows anyone to create a moderation server, which you can use in Bluesky. It would seem this ought to apply to the feeds as well, which they seem to offer a better paradigm than Twitter etc Al already, but not yet what I&#x27;m talking about\n\nI think there is a difference between a message board where everyone sees the same messages and surveillance software which spy on users to build behavioral profiles, which are then used to tailor content for each user. The surveillance software is an active participant in the conversation. It is no longer merely the medium.\n\n  I think it’s helpful to not say things like “surveillance software”, it’s too easy to have those words become a distraction.<p>When you sort by date you should have quite a lot more immunity than when you pick the content a person sees.  Choosing content can manipulate a person and as a result start sharing the responsibility for their actions.<p>Where on the spectrum between protected first amendment expression and conspiracy does a newsfeed algorithm lie?  This is a new question.\n\n    But it&#x27;s so funny that the CIA-funded USG spyware doesn&#x27;t want to let anyone influence what they show their users! All the more so for the TikTok furor.<p>&quot;How dare you propagandize to our citizens! That&#x27;s our job and turf!&quot;\n\n  I long for the days of unfiltered message board communities\n\n    4chan with csam?\n\n      Won’t somebody think of the children. All communication must be filtered through benevolent feed algorithms! Oh no the benevolent feed algorithms are creating pedophiles and terrorists! I yearn for the days of unfiltered chronological communications. Won’t someone think of the children! All communication must be curated by machine learning algorithm. Oh no the machine has created monsters! Wasn’t the web better without the algorithms? Think of the children! We must censor the web! Oh no the web sucks and we still have pedophiles and terrorists. Wouldn’t it be better to go back to 1999? But think of the children.<p>Maximum stack size exceeded exception.\n\n      There has always been a large spectrum from overly censorious forums to 4chan. There’s a lot of room in between those. I don’t want nor do I visit 4chan but I do want something less censored than Reddit.\n\n    Pure unfiltered are very rare, but you can still find things close.\n\nDenying a motion to dismiss is much less meaningful than this editorialized title (by The Register) suggests.\n\n  It&#x27;s more important than you&#x27;re implying, because it subjects the sites to discovery, which is quite burdensome.  Avoiding that sort of trap is why we have SLAPP laws.\n\n    It&#x27;s definitely true that the defendants would have preferred to have the case dismissed, even if they will win eventually (the process is painful and costly).  But that isn&#x27;t really what the clickbait headline says, is it?\n\n      Eh, it confuses what&#x27;s actually stated in the ruling with the direct results of the ruling, which would be a trial on the merits of this, in which they&#x27;ll have to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that they&#x27;re not a link in the chain of whatever radicalized this guy.<p>So I can see that it&#x27;s misleading about what the ruling says, but not about the net effect of the ruling.  But it actually links to the actual ruling here, so it still comes out as a C+ article over all, merely because of the terrible state of legal reporting.\n\n        &gt; Eh, it confuses what&#x27;s actually stated in the ruling with the direct results of the ruling, which would be a trial on the merits of this, in which they&#x27;ll have to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that they&#x27;re not a link in the chain of whatever radicalized this guy.<p>No, they won&#x27;t necessarily. As the ruling makes clear, their Section 230 immunity claim is still live, but there are disputed questions of fact nexessary to resolve it. They only need to refute whatever proof is presented for causation if the plaintiff shows sufficient eveidence that they are a product in a manner not protected by Section 230 <i>and</i> they fail to refute that.\n\n    &gt; Avoiding that sort of trap is why we have SLAPP laws.<p>SLAPP is irrelevant here, since this was not an anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss, it was a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n\n      I wasn&#x27;t claiming that SLAPP applied, I was claiming that it&#x27;s used to avoid even getting to discovery when it does apply, because even letting cases get that far is expensive.\n\n&quot;It&#x27;s not clear when - or even if - the case will go to trial. But it&#x27;s headed that way unless the platforms successfully appeal or settle the matter. The result could set a precedent that makes it harder to use Section 230 as a get-out-of-jail-free card for social media platforms - something that US officials have long tried to do.&quot;<p>They always settle.<p>Could also set a precedent that makes it _easier_ to get cases dismissed on Section 230, but &quot;Big Tech&quot; will settle for a larger amount than it costs to go to trial and get that result.  Year after year they do this.\n\nI&#x27;m looking forward to phone companies being targeted by these lawsuits."

People like Hotz are really fascinating. There is a lot of similarity between him and Musk, and the question of &quot;how can a person be so smart in one way but so absolutely dumb in other ways&quot; is super interesting to me.<p>Both him and Musk are quite intelligent in their respective areas, there shouldn&#x27;t be any doubt about that. But there is a big issue with intelligent people where they often end up on completely wrong tracks. There are some studies that show its actually easier to convince smarter people of wrong information than ordinary people.<p>Generally, the way someone gets very smart in a certain area is through repeated exposure to material. The only way to have that sort of dedication is that you have intrinsic desire to do certain things because it fulfills some purpose in your life, which basically means that you have an ideology attached to that desire. That ideology can be any number of things, from wanting to help humanity, to a more selfish one of just viewing yourself as better than other people because you can accomplish stuff they cant.<p>The thing is, for a very smart person who has a personality like that, you can take a narrative that fits within that ideology, and they are almost guaranteed to believe it, whether its actually true or not. Because them denying it would mean that their ideology isn&#x27;t correct, which means that their entire life has been wasted on wrong things - and no person would ever self destruct like that.<p>Its for this reason Musk believes in all the right wing conspiracy theories despite him having multiple successful startups. To him, democrats are bad (because of the exclusion of Tesla from environmental fund under Biden, which admittedly was pretty shitty), and then everything anti democrat must be correct - you can trace the start of his descent into madness right up to that event.<p>Same thing with Hotz. Super smart dude, but he managed to pick a fight with Sony and basically lost, which would leave a bad taste in anyone&#x27;s mouth, then he read Unqualified Reservations, which perfectly explained the world in such a way where he is the good guy, and the rest follows. As such, he things literature like Atlas Shrugged is actually very good, aligns heavily with Musk because Musk is anti leftism, e.t.c.  At Comma he was heavily against WFH because Musk was against WFH (for very, very stupid reasons), prided himself on being extremely selective with hiring only people that are both smart and are driven, but now with Tiny Grad, he has come to sort realize that you sort of need to hire remote people if you want to have talent, BUT instead of actually hiring people, he only has a few employees and the rest of the work is on a bounty system (being claimed as the future of employment).<p>One could make an argument that when looking at successful tech companies that &quot;won&quot; at a sector, like Apple with consumer electronics, Amazon with online shopping, none of them did it like Comma or Tiny Grad. I personally want nothing more for Hotz companies to succeed, which would truly be disruption at its core, but I don&#x27;t think they will. It seems that you have to essentially engage with all people as humans and appeal to them, but when you view humanity from a viewpoint of &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs&quot;, and tweet about it, its pretty clear that you dislike a large portion of humanity. And of course, engaging with people like that means that you have to appeal to the &quot;professional managerial class&quot; which goes strictly against his ideology.<p>For Comma Ai, that would look like playing nice with investors, getting more money, hiring a wide range of talent local and remote, which would put them on a stage where car companies take them seriously and want to work with them, at which point instead of dedicating resources to making hardware they can be actually making the software a shitload better, which is core to their mission of solving AI. And yes, there would have to be a bunch of bullshit that they would have to sift through, but thats just unavoidable fact of life.<p>You can view Tinycorp in the same light.\n\n      There is no compelling evidence that Musk is smart. That’s not being a “hater” it’s just reality.<p>In any timeframe there are people who rise by luck with timing and opportunity. Musk is that guy. He bet on EVs just before  massive subsidies became available for them and then got lucky as the incumbent companies mostly did nothing.<p>He bet on space just before the US lost its only human capable system and again hovered by taxpayer funds and contracts.<p>All again in an era of free money post 2008.<p>As for the products? Teslas are some of them worst built cars ever made and Tesla produced vehicles for segments Americans don’t want. Minivans, sedans and limousines.<p>Space X meanwhile makes rockets which are a step back from the Shuttle in terms of capability and which will now require 6-8 launches what Apollo could do in 1. All built on lies about building a Mars capable craft which will carry 100 people - a feat Starship will never attain as it’s too small.<p>Musk has had an incredible string of luck but makes awful decisions, has no design sense and pretends to be a genius.<p>He’s very average indeed. His politics and attitudes are like a lot of gamers because that’s all he is.\n\n        You are very much being a hater.<p>&gt; Musk is that guy. He bet on EVs just before massive subsidies became available for them and then got lucky as the incumbent companies mostly did nothing.<p>Execution of an idea is 10000% times harder than actually having an idea. Furthermore, even if you consider just the idea of putting money into something that makes you money,  your &quot;logic&quot; of getting lucky can be used to discredit most anyone who predicted anything and made money off of it, saying that they just got lucky. When in reality, that prediction was probably made through a bunch of research and reasoning that nobody else did.<p>&gt;As for the products? Teslas are some of them worst built cars ever made and Tesla produced vehicles for segments Americans don’t want.<p>Model Y is literally the best selling car in the world, which is more impressive given the general anti Musk sentiment, especially in more socially progressive countries. You can&#x27;t honestly think that saying &quot;well all these people want this car, but they are all wrong because the car is horribly built&quot;, makes you sound anywhere near coherent.<p>&gt;Space X meanwhile makes rockets which are a step back from the Shuttle in terms of capability and which will now require 6-8 launches what Apollo could do in 1.<p>And yet, it still has a shitload of contracts, including a pretty big one from NASA.<p>&gt;Musk has had an incredible string of luck but makes awful decisions, has no design sense and pretends to be a genius.<p>And yet, Twitter is still alive and kicking, Space X is doing really good, Tesla is doing good.<p>The problem with people like you posting your baseless opinions like this is you make it harder to actually criticize people like Musk, because it gives credence to the idea that people&#x2F;media just want to push a negative narrative against them, and to anyone on the fence, they are more likely to see all the dumb shit he does with a skeptical view, believing that the stories are vastly exaggerated.\n\n        Getting from scratch to new businesses, and the most complicated ones and succeeding is no luck. Rocket science and automotive are very complicated in their own ways, and competing against businesses with 100+ years of IP and experience.... If the Space shuttle and Apollo were so good they would still be in production, the Concord as well. I guess it has something to do with the reliability and % to have a crew survive the launch and also the cost. I kinda respect his legacy more than all those social networks&#x2F;search engine&#x2F;marketplace gurus. But I do hate Musk&#x27;s personality and I&#x27;m definitely not a fanboy,but still, respect is due where it&#x27;s earned.\n\n        Ohh definitely Elon is smart, he developed a space shooter game and published it in a computer magazine at an early age, so clearly he taught himself 6502 assembly, he developed zip2 city search, it had maps using the Navteq GIS database it was a time when google maps were not developed. All of this was written in Java by a single person at the time.\n\n      George Hotz expressed his thoughts on this comment on his youtube channel\n\n        Hah. Thats 2 comments of mine on HN that got notices by industry people.<p>IMO, if he, Elon Musk, and Steven Bonnell&#x2F;Destiny sat down together and had like a 4 hour long discussion with the prefaces to explore  ideas, I feel like thats an easy 10 million view Youtube video. Musk has the knowledge of how industry works, George is a lot more philosophically grounded in tech, and Steven is the best representation of the humanities aspect.\n\n        For those wondering:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6fFUfyT-EyA&amp;t=1160s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6fFUfyT-EyA&amp;t=1160s</a>\n\n      Comma.ai is profitable, and as long as TinyCorp is profitable all else will follow. AMD &#x2F; NVidia &#x2F; Intel these are all means to a commoditised petaflops. And for that too happen starting with a decent affordable hardware was a good choice, turns out they are affordable because they dont have a good handle on their hardware or software. And the way the Red organisation is structured it seems things are not going to become better, its better to move to the winning Team. (Green)\n\n      Are there books or literature which are related to this? Or are these all your thoughts? I&#x27;m curious because I want to learn more about it\n\n    If anything his weakness is being too optimistic. Oh no, he started a self-driving company and didn&#x27;t achieve level 5. Oh no, he set out to fix AMD GPUs and ran into roadblocks that aren&#x27;t his fault. So mid!\n\nDoes Nvidia have any real competition that’s already shipped?\n\n  That is the thing, they can allow themselves to have all that proprietary stuff, because Intel, AMD just can&#x27;t get their act together.<p>Even the whole OpenCL versus CUDA, they had years to ship something that was great tooling alternative, instead they did everything but that.\n\n  Why would there be? The writing was on the wall that this was important 10 years ago and no one moved on it, in fact AMD and Apple both fumbled OpenCL then proceeded to waste several more years after that.<p>I know some people don&#x27;t like Nvidia but like their competition had their opportunity and what needed to be done spelt out to them and did nothing.\n\n  The MI300 is the best accelerator you can buy, for many current workloads.<p>It&#x27;s technically way more advanced. Not as outrageously priced as an H100 either.\n\n  TBH I don&#x27;t know what they were counting on. 4090 has almost 3x BF16 tensor ops&#x2F;s vs 7900XTX. So you can just buy a regular PC with 2x4090 for half the price and have basically the same training performance with much less headache.\n\nFrequently people say on HN you should use AMD but looks like it&#x27;s not going to work. I am glad to stick to straightforward Nvidia GPU &#x2F; Epyc CPU stack. Don&#x27;t want to innovate for this.\n\n  there is no room for innovation in high performance tensor evaluation, cost-performance, or usability. we&#x27;re just done.\n\n    There is room, but if you are not working on building the framework, it&#x27;s not worth building the framework. The time cost is high.\n\n  It&#x27;s not either or, you can use different vendors for different tasks.<p>tinygrad isn&#x27;t in the realm of production ready though, AFAIK.\n\n    Yes but the same could be said about rocm.\n\nSomething that isn&#x27;t really talked about is that Tiny Corp has been kind of working against AMD&#x27;s interests. Tinybox is&#x2F;was about <i>replacing</i> MI300s with much cheaper 7900 XTXs. I&#x27;m not terribly surprised to discover that AMD is not investing in ROCm on consumer cards (which are a different architecture) even though they&#x27;re technically supported.\n\n  No one would be buying A100&#x27;s if CUDA hadn&#x27;t been supported on all desktop Nvidia cards for years. Desktop cards provide an accessible on ramp to the ecosystem. PhD grads with boxes of desktop cards turn into the purchasers of data center chips.\n\n    Nvidia was forced to do that because it was so early, they had no customers except PhDs. I see no evidence AMD wants to do that right now, and instead focusing on extracting value from deep pocket enterprise customers.<p>The way things go, I think the AMD consumer card experience will only get better once AMD manage to gimp consumer cards’ ML throughput or RAM.\n\n      &gt; The way things go, I think the AMD consumer card experience will only get better once AMD manage to gimp consumer cards’ ML throughput or RAM.<p>Que? Making things worse will make things better?\n\n        They&#x27;ll let you do some things on a consumer card as soon as they can make sure that you can&#x27;t effectively use the consumer card in place of an enterprise card.\n\n          so, artificial market segmentation?<p>...that&#x27;s exactly how you get disruptive competition.\n\n            It&#x27;s worth noting this is a game nvidia has already been playing for a long time by intentionally limiting the performance of higher precision floating point operations on consumer cards.\n\n      If you ask ML engineers now 100% will have started on desktop cards. Trying to squeeze the most money out of everyone just makes the ecosystem fail.<p>Look at IBM, they sell technologies that no one uses until they get hired to work on them specifically. It&#x27;s profitable enough but it&#x27;s not a way to grow the ecosystem&#x2F;market.\n\n        I think you are preaching to the choir, and AMD is not listening.<p>AMD would be selling 48GB 7900s or AI-only W7900s if they really wanted a consumer card ramp.<p>They don&#x27;t. Not because they can&#x27;t (they literally prevent OEMs from doing so, who would double up VRAM in a heartbeat without AMD lifting a finger), but because AMD doesn&#x27;t want that.\n\nThis was destined to be a hard problem. Surprised to see they are giving up so easily.\n\nIdentifying MES &amp; CP as the barriers to an AMD tinybox and letting the community know is a huge service and is still great engineering even if they decide it&#x27;s an immoveable barrier and walk away.\n\nwhat&#x27;s so tiny about a box that has 6 gpus?\n\n  It&#x27;s not $150K.\n\n    Reminds me of the &quot;super mini computer&quot; that was still the size of two fridges.<p>Only makes sense if you understand the niche market it competes in.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superminicomputer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superminicomputer</a>\n\nWhat advantage will remain if tensorflow and PyTorch works on AMD cards? <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;nvidia-cuda-amd-zluda&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;nvidia-cuda-amd-zluda&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pytorch.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pytorch.org&#x2F;</a> has a rocm support .

And us GPU poors accessing it via cloud (shudders).\n\ngiven his background in the <i>jailbreak</i> community, I look forward to him jailbreaking the AMD GPU firmware load process :-D\n\n  Jailbreaking is not the problem. The problem is reverse engineering a large firmware that operates on HW they have no docs for and fixing the firmware (ie. doing it better that original manufacturer that has access to everything).<p>The job of firmware is so close to the hw that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to decode. You need to decode a custom CPU instructions for a IP block the microcode is running on (it&#x27;s custom, no ARM&#x2F;RISC&#x2F;MIPS..).<p>After that you have to decode what firmware actually does. It writes something to this.... What does it mean? It&#x27;s completely opaque number written to a opaque memory... cache control? Delay?<p>And you do that why? So you can ship tinybox (i.e. cheap consumer GPU). Let&#x27;s says you succeed. Do the same thing Next gen will be similar challenge, except firmware will be better locked, because AMD will want consumer HW to be segregated from data center GPU, the same way NVidia does.<p>The task itself is basically impossible and waste of time. There is the reason why NVidia driver driver for Linux was used basically only to install official driver.\n\nrelevant to his tenstorrent mention: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39658787\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39658787</a><p>and an bunch more <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=tenstorrent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=tenstorrent</a>"

Some website still completely brake.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.com.&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.com.&#x2F;</a> is a 404 for instance. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com.&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com.&#x2F;</a> redirects. https versions often give certificate errors.\n\n  When it comes to certificates, the specification <i>explicitly</i> says that only www.something.example is correct† even if in DNS terms that should be www.something.example.<p>Thus it&#x27;s misissuance (ie against the rules, you&#x27;d need to stop doing it or risk being distrusted) to issue that site a certificate for &quot;www.something.example.&quot; instead of (or as well as) &quot;www.something.example&quot; and I&#x27;d guess that since we have CT (and thus can see mistakes in almost real time) nobody does that.<p>Of course a web browser could, AFAIK just <i>accept</i> that www.something.example is the correct name to see in the certificate, it seems Firefox at least does that and perhaps all popular browsers do.<p>Unfortunately the web <i>server</i> also needs to understand how this works and the linked site reports that (at least when it was written) Apache httpd doesn&#x27;t.

The Edge browser team at least seemed interested when reporting a separate dot-handling issue\n\nI remember a tester reporting a weird issue a couple of years ago - turns out he accidentally had a a trailing . in the URL and as a result login wasn&#x27;t working (I think there was CORS code that was checking the base domain that didn&#x27;t account for the trailing .).\n\n  Ah! That sounds like a fun bug that makes you scratch your head.<p>Reminds me of one a few months ago. I was reviewing a weird bug that our QA team found with phone regexes, if the phone number started I think with a 1, and it had all 1&#x27;s if you typed anything else, it would wipe it all out, turns out area codes in the US never begin with 1 or 0, so regexes will wipe it out since its invalid.\n\nIt&#x27;s rather ironic that the submitted URL is not <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dns-sd.org.&#x2F;trailingdotsindomainnames.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dns-sd.org.&#x2F;trailingdotsindomainnames.html</a><p>Here&#x27;s a corrected submission:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39773646\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39773646</a><p>(TIL that HN doesn&#x27;t canonicalize the hostname in submissions for de-duplication purposes.)\n\nThis is an annoying gap in the standards.<p>If you are in a situation where you know the domain name must be fully qualified (you are a web server, say) it makes sense to canonicalize the domain by removing any trailing dot.<p>The article cites RFC 1738 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc1738#page-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc1738#page-6</a> which specified that a host name in a URL must be a fully qualified domain name. RFC 3986 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc3986#page-21\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc3986#page-21</a>  is much more relaxed: it doesn’t have to be fully qualified, or even a domain name – it could be a NETBIOS name, for example.<p>And so software that handles URLs has to cope with unqualified or partially-qualified domain names and the associated ugly problems with resolver search paths. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc1535.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc1535.html</a> The whatwg URL spec <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;url.spec.whatwg.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;url.spec.whatwg.org&#x2F;</a> doesn’t simplify; it insists that FQDNs with and without trailing dots are different.<p>What is missing is a clear specification of how resolver APIs should handle partially qualified domain names (wrt search paths and number of dots etc.) and how to turn a name into a fully-qualified domain name. User interfaces such as browser URL bars should use this to canonicalize hosts in URLs.<p>I would prefer to restrict partially-qualified names to simple single-label unqualified hostnames. This restriction means anything with a dot can be assumed to be an FQDN, so you don’t need to talk to the resolver to canonicalize it. Dunno how upset people would be at forbidding dots in partially-qualified names.<p>Turning a hostname into a fully-qualified domain name is more tricky. A name’s FQDN is not the same thing as its canonical name, as returned by getaddrinfo <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.freebsd.org&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;man.cgi?query=getaddrinfo&amp;sektion=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.freebsd.org&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;man.cgi?query=getaddrinfo&amp;sektio...</a> - ai_canonname is the last name in the CNAME chain, which is often some artifact of how the server is provisioned. (eg, www.apple.com -&gt; e6858.dscx.akamaiedge.net for me just now.) Instead, you (or rather the stub resolver) get the FQDN by appending each of the stub resolver’s search domains to the unqualified name in turn, until a DNS lookup succeeds; the FQDN is the name the stub resolver successfully queried for. You can’t get this from getaddrinfo. The old resolver API <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.freebsd.org&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;man.cgi?query=gethostbyname&amp;sektion=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.freebsd.org&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;man.cgi?query=gethostbyname&amp;sekt...</a>  returns a list of aliases, which I think you can use to get an FQDN, though it might be confusing if the result comes from &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts instead of the DNS.<p>For added fun, there are situations such as mail domains where a trailing dot is forbidden, so it isn’t possible to disambiguate between fully-qualified and partially-qualified domains. The consensus in the mail world is basically that mail domains should only be FQDNs, which is a fairly solid solution. (There was also a mistake when the grammar was revised for RFC 2821 that required at least one dot in a mail domain, which made it even harder to send mail to the few ccTLDs with joke MX records.)\n\nYears ago, there were a couple of newspaper websites where adding a dot after the domain name bypassed the paywall."

NixOS is blowing up with Linux hobbyists right now because there&#x27;s already so much it can do without experienced administrator.

That probably fell apart since I left, unless the high quality CTO I was serving is still there.\n\n    I am not sure if this is a tongue-in-cheek comment that&#x27;s above my comedic pay grade, but if it is not:<p>This sounds like a lot of words that would otherwise mean nothing to any Nix&#x2F;Guix user. It works. It is not &quot;too idealistic goal&quot;, Nix repositories already contain more packages than any distribution around.<p>It is too late to throw the occasional uninspiring &quot;you are too ambitious.&quot; Because they have been doing this for years now successfully.\n\nSince OCI determinism was mentioned, I feel it may be of interest that some friends and I bootstrapped a linux distro from 0 to solve exactly this problem.<p>[Stageˣ]: The container native, full source bootstrapped, musl based, and reproducible toolchain to build all of the things.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;stagex&#x2F;stagex\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;stagex&#x2F;stagex</a><p>A lot more to come on this soon.<p>This was only possible by carefully incorporating and cribbing a huge amount of bootstrapping and reproducibility work from the Stage0, live-bootstrap, Docker, Guix, Nix, mrustc, Debian, Alpine, and Arch teams, many of whose members have generously helped unblock us several times."

      "conversation_text": "Forcing myself out of the house, even if I&#x27;m still just scrolling HN and youtube, not doing it at home encouraged me to get back into networking, getting into networking helped me connect with people, connecting with people made me feel more hopeful. As cliche as it is, getting moving really helps, go for a super long walk, really really breath deeply right into your belly and just walk with purpose (the purpose of just walking), I also just do some weird silly dancing around my kitchen to music (I&#x27;d kinda forgotten that can be quite fun). However for me, the most helpful by a mile was psilocybin. That whole &quot;this too shall pass&quot; thing is a real thing. Sending you good luck!\n\n  &gt; However for me, the most helpful by a mile was psilocybin. That whole &quot;this too shall pass&quot; thing is a real thing.<p>Also for me two big things. I have over a decade and a half of experience with LSD and psilocybin and it has in my view the role of what ecstatic religious experiences had in the past. I can&#x27;t really bring myself to believe in any doctrine deeply enough to experience that anymore but psychedelics are very similar in terms of insight, epiphanies and catharsis.<p>&gt; I also just do some weird silly dancing around my kitchen to music<p>I&#x27;ve come to see this in my life as a sign I&#x27;m happy more than a cause. When I&#x27;m depressed I don&#x27;t much listen to music or dance, and the opposite is also true.\n\nI figured out which industry I wanted to work in (data analytics at first) and just took action. Studied what I needed to for the jobs I wanted, and took classes to advance my skills. The confidence I gained from this was great.  I also prioritize outside time and going in long walks when it’s nice out. That’s huge for me.\n\nIn-person yoga classes have turned out to be dramatically therapeutic for me, which surprised me because I was already seeing a therapist, and I thought I didn&#x27;t enjoy exercise at all.<p>(If ClassPass is in your area, they have a free trial that makes it easy to try out many different studios.)\n\n  Yep. Being at the back of a yoga class always works for me\n\nI have felt a a sort of fog&#x2F;rut for years now. Figured it was just age. Doc checked my testosterone level and it was super low. About 10% of what you would want.<p>Started taking T via a gel&#x2F;lotion and after about two weeks I noticed a significant change in my productivity. The rut&#x2F;fog was gone, I was working like I did 15 years ago.<p>Prescription ran out, was out of town, basically missed 10 days. Fog was back, a week on it again and it is gone.<p>Moral of the story, don&#x27;t try to &quot;will&quot; your way out - see a doc, make sure everything is working right.\n\n  Out of curiosity, how old were you when you got it checked?\n\n    44...have had some health challenges in past 4 years including a heart attack. Weight loss flat lined and other things not responding properly to meds so I started searching for answers as to why, found some correlation data with T values and asked for a test.\n\n  currently in the same boat, although the gel isn&#x27;t helping for me.  i actually got a letter from the doctor this morning today saying that he basically doesn&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ve actually been using the gel, so that&#x27;s going to be fun to deal with lol.\n\n  I know it is a minor things, any change in your hair loss?<p>I&#x27;m asking because because there are studies that links T to DHT to hair loss.\n\n    i think it almost certainly will accelerate hair loss if you have MPB, my T has barely risen since starting treatment and even i have noticed the difference in hair loss.\n\n    None for me at this point, but pretty early in the process\n\n    Yes. I don&#x27;t have a family history of MPB, I&#x27;ve been taking T after a doctor recommended it and my hairline started noticeably receding within 6 months.\n\n      Why not take finasteride as well to offset it?\n\n  I highly recommend trying HCG which is the safer option initially and preserves fertility. It also prevents testicular atrophy.<p>Depending on your Hypogonadism however, you may not see great results, if you have primary then it won&#x27;t do much but for secondary cases you&#x27;ll see your T levels increase.<p>In any case, doing TRT + HCG is ideal for most secondary Hypogoands. If cost is not an issue, it&#x27;s a good thing to add to your protocol and for many people it might be the missing link for libido improvements should TRT alone fail.<p>I Started with HCG mono, now I&#x27;ve been doing TRT + HCG for 24 months. Best decision I&#x27;ve ever made and it basically saved my marriage. I had no sexual function before.\n\nIt&#x27;s always a eucatastrophe[1] for me. Some random event occurs and it gives me something to focus on. Maybe a person shows up in my life, or an event, or an idea. Contrary to common belief, trying to pull myself out through sheer will and habits never worked.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eucatastrophe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eucatastrophe</a>\n\n  I love your website and your games!<p>So wholesome to see someone still loving to use the 6502 :)\n\n    Thanks! That means a lot.\n\n      Love your games as well! Have you considered packaging them for Steam and pricing at less than 5 dollars? (i.e. a single pack of all your NES games) - if you promote to a few YouTube retro influencers you might make a few sales. :-)\n\n        Thanks. I might sell some one day, maybe as a physical cartridge release as those have better margins. Mostly though I want people to enjoy my stuff, so a lot of what I release is free.\n\n          Make it on both steam and cartridge.<p>Expose you and your work.<p>Both are beautiful\n\nFor me I had a little phase of not understanding the despair and hatred I received for forking Audacity at the time. I didn&#x27;t understand why people would do that, and neither why they decide to have &quot;fun&quot; being a bully online and lying about things that never happened. When &#x2F;pol&#x2F; and kiwifarms came at me, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to deal with that, especially because most rumors supposedly happened when I was asleep, not even reacting to what was happening at the time.<p>So it kind of resulted in a phase that you are describing, where I kind of gave up on open source and gave up on doing the things that I loved to do before.<p>What I can recommend, heavily: shut off your phone, go outside for a couple weeks, no tech, no internet, nobody nagging or forcing you to do anything. And listen. To nature, to the environment, to what you think. Take with you a notebook and a pen, and write down your thoughts. Persist on not going online, and fight the addiction.<p>Social detox and meditation is much more efficient than one might think, if you have no predefined goal on what you want to do. If your goals are set by external influences, you won&#x27;t be happy with it.<p>Best wishes, I understand how hard it can be sometimes. Don&#x27;t lose your head in things you don&#x27;t want to do.\n\n  God damn! This hits, and it also hits in its simplicity.<p>Thanks :)\n\n  I watched this yesterday and it mirrors your advice about disconnecting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TLRmLC2LFT8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TLRmLC2LFT8</a><p>A big part of &quot;finding yourself&quot; is likely related to introspection, which is interrupted by constantly being bombarded with attention grabbing mechanisms.\n\n  I love love love this- you are 100% right<p>&gt; shut off your phone, go outside for a couple weeks, no tech, no internet, nobody nagging or forcing you to do anything. And listen. To nature, to the environment, to what you think. Take with you a notebook and a pen, and write down your thoughts. Persist on not going online, and fight the addiction.\n\n  Cal Newport&#x27;s book, Digital Minimalism, is on this topic of disconnecting. It&#x27;s not what I was expecting going into the book, but it was very interesting and something I hadn&#x27;t really considered before. People today spend little to no times with their own thoughts, and always have some other form of input pushing their mind one way or another, be in a social feed, podcast, book, news, or music. It is very easy to always use those things to fill any void with distractions.\n\n  Omg hey! Good advice.<p>The one bit <i>I</i> don&#x27;t understand is:<p>&gt; <i>I didn&#x27;t understand why people would do that, and neither why they decide to have &quot;fun&quot; being a bully online and lying about things that never happened.</i><p>Like, do you have an autism diagnosis or something? You&#x27;re claiming mystification at a basic, rudimentary feature of human behavior. It&#x27;s like not understanding humor or something.\n\nA good psychotherapist could of course provide the environment, support, guidance and relationship to help you find your way through this stuff<p>This is how I found my way.<p>Back in 1992 I, ran my own business, my first child was 2 years old, had a wonderful partner and was financially secure.<p>Just after my child was born I suddenly has access to my childhood years which had been out of my awareness (dissociation). Vivid dreams and memories terrorised me through every waking and sleeping hour of the trauma I experienced as a child.<p>My friends had always talked about their childhoods, holidays, school friends, memories but for me it was like I did not remember anything of my childhood.<p>The pressures of life took their toll and overcame me. I became clinically depressed and abandoned my life, partner and child and moved into a squat. I spent the next year just wasting away.<p>I then found my way into psychotherapy for the first time and over the next 3 years changed my life.<p>After 3 years of Transactional Analysis I told my therapist that I wanted to do what she was doing. I began my training a therapist and have never looked back.<p>There is nothing that is written that says life is easy, its just that we need a new set of tools at different times and different developmental stages throughout life.\n\n  Never looked back? What about your wife and child?\n\n    They also never looked back\n\nBeware of toxic definitions of squandering your life.<p>Even successful people let failures define them and get depressed. Set acheivable goals and celebrate those, trying to do hard things is a constant struggle and is mostly failures for me, you need to see progress. Even if you do not think small things are worth being thankful for it actually helps to train yourself to see positive things.\n\nSure, I&#x27;ve bottomed out pretty badly twice.<p>First time was late teen years and early 20s. I experienced some sort of mental illness issue that hasn&#x27;t recurred since and I never even attempted to get treated or diagnosed. I saw something similar watching the Temple Grandin biopic years later, but it involved shaking fits and banging my head against furniture in my dorm room. I dropped out of college in my first semester and did not immediately try to go back, only registering for classes at community college to keep my dad&#x27;s health insurance coverage, then dropping them, until the school suspended me and I moved onto another one, being lucky I suppose to live in LA County with a car and having access to endless community college systems.<p>Within two years, I was working at Disneyland as a show performer when the enterainment division at parks had layoffs. At the very same time, I&#x27;d gone so off the rails in personal life that I&#x27;d married a woman I met in a writing class on our first date, and she proved to be unpredictable and unstable and destroyed our apartment, so I got evicted at the same time. I was too ashamed to even talk to my parents and lived on the street for a few weeks.<p>Getting out of that one was just a long, slow climb. I divorced and met a woman on the Internet and moved across the country to be with her. We only stayed together a year, but it was a very positive experience. I lived with her mother, a gracious, lovely person who otherwise lived alone, an Italian immigrant who is still the best cook I&#x27;ve ever lived with and instilled in me in a love of food and cooking that endures to this day. Her father was great to me as well, taking me through rotations of meeting different friends of his in various career fields to get an idea of what they all did, to think of what I might want to do with my own life. I eventually moved back home and just got serious. Went to yet another community college, but this time actually took the classes, spending nearly every minute not in class studying in the library, then worked a graveyard shift job detailing restrooms at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, another amusement park. It wasn&#x27;t a great life and I still slept in my car pretty frequently, but I was young enough to endure this and I did until I could transfer and eventually graduate and have a real adult life.<p>The second time was in my late 30s. I experienced severe spinal degeneration and years of treatment made it no better. I herniated discs all the time doing mundane everyday tasks, things like standing up to get out of a car, putting dishes in a dishwasher, attempting to put pants on. Eventually, one day I was getting dressed after showering in the morning and started spasming. This was not like any other spasm I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve had them since I was 16. I fell onto the floor, and then every 30 seconds or so, felt like someone had attached jumper cables to my lumbar spine. My entire body seized up each time like every muscle cramped simultaneously. This went on for nearly three days. I&#x27;ve never wanted to shoot myself so badly and even owned a handgun, but I couldn&#x27;t move to get to it. I didn&#x27;t go to the ER because I would not have been able to get into a car and didn&#x27;t want to spend on an ambulance.<p>Finally, when it subsided, I got a steroid shot that let me move somewhat normally. I&#x27;d been working remotely for a boutique hedge fund building machine learning models, but as a contractor, so had no disability or PTO or anything and simply couldn&#x27;t work. Once I was able to move again, I got a referral from one of my wife&#x27;s contacts at her job and found a reasonable job pretty quickly, and serendipitously, it required a security clearance but they were willing to sponsor it. This was lucky because that takes a while and I was going to need spine surgery and would be missing some time right off the bat, but they didn&#x27;t care and started me anyway, granting the leave even though FMLA doesn&#x27;t require it until you&#x27;ve been with the same employer for 12 months.<p>The surgery did not go well. I sprung a cerebrospinal fluid leak afterward and experienced severe nausea and disorientation. I couldn&#x27;t eat anything but saltine crackers and lost 20 pounds within two months, and was not even close to overweight so this was not a happy loss. It seemed to go away on its own, but instead of going away, it was instead leaking into a cyst, which eventually swelled to first size, hurting so badly I could not let anything touch that part of my back. When I got in for an MRI, they were so panicked by what they saw that the spine surgeon cleared his prior appointments and I got surgery 8 hours later.<p>I recovered okay from that one, but by this time, years of this stuff happening had taken its toll. My discs were almost non-existent at L4&#x2F;L5 and L5&#x2F;S1, so narrow that my vertebrae were sometimes bone on bone and the osteoarthritis and sciatica from that was sometimes unbearable. Both my legs went numb at times and I constantly felt like I was walking on pinpricks or being electrocuted in my feet. I had to have my 3rd spine surgery in the span of 16 months at that point, this one they called the &quot;mother of all spine surgeries.&quot; A multilevel anterior lumbar interbody fusion, in which they cut open the front first and cut out your spinal discs through you guts, replacing them with metal spacers, then sew that back up and go in through the back to attach screws and rods and saw off a piece of your hip to seed a bone graft that eventually turns your lumbar spine into one long solid bone that grows in and around permanent titanium hardware.<p>The span of time over which this all happened, nearly two years, was far and away the worst time of my life. I couldn&#x27;t always walk, and when I did, required a cane at best, a walker at worst. I needed assitance rails installed into my bathroom, replaced my regular bed with a hospital bed. I stopped wearing regular clothes because they were too hard to put on. Sweats and slippers were about the best I could do. I needed an assistive device to put socks on because I couldn&#x27;t easily touch my own feet. My wife was often emptying bedpans and bottles for me when I couldn&#x27;t leave the bed.<p>But I did recover. Once I could walk, I did, often a lot, hours a day. I knew I was going to need to be stronger to better support my shit joints as I aged, and started with resistance bands at first because that was all I could do. Progress has been slow and frequently interrupted by nagging annoying injuries and joint swelling, but progress has been had. Today, I lift six days a week for close to an hour per session, some combination of barbells, dumbbells, and a cable machine. I run nearly every day, though it took me five years before I was brave enough to even try because, at first, one attempt to just run across the street felt like someone was hitting me with a sledgehammer at every footfall. If you don&#x27;t catch me limping up the stairs or needing to grab the bedside table to get out of bed, an average person on the street would think I&#x27;m perfectly fine. I&#x27;m in my mid-40s now but look like an underwear model. I&#x27;ve never been fat, but the need to be so diligent and disciplined just to get through a normal day, plus my continued love of cooking my own food, has translated well into very careful food logging and diet tracking, which has enabled me to become extremely lean while also building noticeable muscle now that I&#x27;ve been lifting for years without a break.<p>I did so well at the new job years back that I moved around frequently to troubled hotspots, given special assignments, promoted rapidly. Luckily, this happened during the famous zero-interest free-spending VC years, so recruiters were calling all the time, and even though I was never going to move to Silicon Valley or New York (I&#x27;ve lived in Texas now for nearly 15 years), I was able to find remote work that resulted in a tripling of my first post-surgery salary, at a company that has no office and was all-remote before Covid even hit, so there is no return to office crap going on. This leaves me able to work out and cook rather than spending my &quot;free&quot; time commuting or dazing onto social media when I get bored at work but can&#x27;t leave the desk.<p>All in all, I think I can see a few common themes in how I recovered from bad times. Developing better habits and sticking with them for many years, being patient and persistent. It takes time to build anything. Another is the kindness and generosity of others. I may have been streetbound forever or dead if not for some girl from New Jersey and her family that saw something in me and took me in. I&#x27;d have for sure killed myself during the spine problems if not for the support of my wife, not to mention we needed her second engineer&#x27;s salary to get by when I couldn&#x27;t work. We&#x27;ve never lived such that we <i>need</i> two salaries, but it&#x27;s awfully nice to have a fallback when one goes away for a while. My company didn&#x27;t need to give me medical leave before I was FMLA eligible and they could have not hired me at all knowing I had already scheduled a major spine surgery. If you asked for advice on whether to even disclose that on Hacker News, I can guarantee almost everyone would tell you to lie, but I did not and it worked out.<p>Ultimately, we live in communities for a reason and I don&#x27;t know if you can do this alone.<p>This, of course, all depends on what level of rut you mean here. Maybe if it&#x27;s general malaise, then testosterone, meditation, or digital detox is all you need. Lucky if it&#x27;s that easy.\n\n  GPT summary for those interested:<p>Throughout their experiences, the author emphasizes the importance of developing good habits, being patient and persistent, and relying on the kindness and support of others. They attribute much of their recovery to the generosity of friends, family, and colleagues, highlighting the significance of community and interpersonal connections.<p>The post concludes by suggesting that overcoming such challenges often requires a combination of personal effort and external support, and acknowledges that solutions vary depending on the severity of the situation.\n\nThis could help: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oblique_Strategies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oblique_Strategies</a>\n\nYou must have something going on to feel better - be it work or studying, well, at least it&#x27;ll make it easier. You can combine that with psychotherapy, physical activity or SSRIs if needed, and most importantly, keep a good balance with fun activities. You must get rid of your &quot;learned helplessness&quot;, by achieving something from your effort, if you feel like you have it.\n\nDoing sport 2 times a week helps me a lot. I also enjoy spending time with my friends on weekends and with my family during work days. All this helps a bit but still sometimes I feel exactly like you do.\n\nAt one point I had a bookshelf full of books on depression, fear, lack of confidence, etc., so it&#x27;s impossible to answer such a broad question in a comment, but let me comment on the &quot;high potential&quot; sub-question.<p>Personally I no longer think that &quot;high potential&quot; is a real thing--I think of it more as of a mental trap that can play part in depression (it definitely played a big part in mine..).<p>What I mean by that (and it&#x27;s not my own concept, I&#x27;m sure I read about it in one of the aforementioned books), is that the only reality that exists is the one we&#x27;re living in right now. There are no other realities--unless you&#x27;re dr Strange of course, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not :)--where you&#x27;re better off.<p>As a consequence, your place in this reality is <i>exactly</i> where you&#x27;re supposed to be at this very moment.<p>Note that if you&#x27;re in a bad situation, I&#x27;m not saying you should be happy about it, not at all!! I&#x27;m saying that given there&#x27;s only this one reality that we have, if you are in a given situation then you are in the given situation and no amount of &quot;what ifs&quot; will change the present moment. It will only make you more depressed.<p>So this is basically acceptance. But the term &quot;acceptance&quot; can mean two different things to different people--I don&#x27;t mean acceptance as in resignation or passivity (&quot;it is like it is so it&#x27;s all hopeless&quot;), I mean something like &quot;as of this moment the state of the world is XYZ and there are no other worlds in which I&#x27;m in a better place, so there&#x27;s no point in beating myself that I could have done ABC. If I could have done it back then, I would have done it. If I didn&#x27;t do it then that was the only possibility back then because as of now we&#x27;re at the point XYZ, which is a result of me not doing ABC before (and of bazillion other events, so me doing ABC might still not end up the way I would think).&quot;).<p>Tongue in a cheek--I&#x27;m sure I could have written it more clearly :))<p>EDIT: I think I lost the &quot;high potential&quot; thread along the way. So: IMO &quot;high potential&quot; is a mental construct that can easily depress us. &quot;I have&#x2F;had such a high potential and I haven&#x27;t used it. I&#x27;m a failure&quot;. No, stop!! This is a fantasy land!<p>You might have the highest IQ in the world (or the most flexible muscles, or whatever other advantage there can be). And you&#x27;ve definitely been using your IQ in your decision making, almost by definition. And you made the decisions you made yourself, correct? (I&#x27;m ignoring all the external interferences, as we&#x27;re talking about &quot;high potential&quot;.) Which means that you used your potential.<p>The fact that you can easily generate 100-digit prime numbers out of the top of your head doesn&#x27;t mean that you can be top scientist just like that, because the scientist also need a reliable schedule, curiosity and tons of other things. And so the &quot;high potential&quot; fantasy is basically focusing on the prime numbers and skipping the other factors.<p>Now you can beat yourself that you lost you high potential because you didn&#x27;t get up at 6 day by day to do some research. But that&#x27;s exactly my point--you didn&#x27;t because you didn&#x27;t think it was advantageous to you, or maybe you did think that but you&#x27;ve had undiagnosed ADHD and that made it an order of magnitude harder. \nSo what I&#x27;m saying is that your <i>actual</i> potential has been exactly what you observed!<p>And if you&#x27;re not convinced, or if you disagree with me, then I have one final question: let&#x27;s say you really had a high potential and you really failed at it, and you&#x27;re really a failure (all BS, but let&#x27;s assume otherwise). Given that the past is gone and you cannot do anything about it, how does beating yourself help you?\n\n  Reflect on what you did wrong, but do not keep beating yourself up over it?\n\n    Yes! &quot;Extract&quot; your lessons from the past but with the future in mind.<p>One big caveat--it&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; only by your today&#x27;s standards. Back then it was most likely &quot;right&quot; (willful crimes aside), that&#x27;s why you chose to do it! So I would strike it and leave simply: &quot;reflect on what you did, (...)&quot;.\n\n  &gt; So what I&#x27;m saying is that your actual potential has been exactly what you observed!<p>+1; How close is my paraphrasing to what you were thinking?<p>achievement(person) = potential(person) - adversity(person)<p>People implicitly assume the &#x27;adversity&#x27; term is negligible. But in reality, the &#x27;adversity&#x27; term can very large, <i>and</i> vary widely from person to person.<p>[yep the &quot;equation&quot; isn&#x27;t dimensionally consistent. It&#x27;s meant to be a &quot;completion prompt&quot; to your internal LLM to translate those tokens to a longer paragraph.]\n\n    At first I thought your equation sums it up perfectly, then caveats started to appear and then caveats to caveats. And in an hour I realized a PhD could be built around it :)). So I won&#x27;t give you a simple answer, but I&#x27;ll write some loose thoughts, likely incoherent, etc., OK?<p>- I think the only real&#x2F;tangible&#x2F;measurable&#x2F;graspable part is the `achievement` side. Although personally I wouldn&#x27;t call it `achievement` but sth like `present state`. It&#x27;s because `achievement` invites comparison, and if someone already compares themselves to some idealize figure, then I think it would be more helpful to use neutral terms. Also, it cannot be measured--you can measure net worth, but not empathy or compassion.<p>- On the right side of the equation I would treat both the potential and the adversity as unknown and fixed. By fixed I mean that in each moment of the past they had some fixed value, and by unknown I mean that it&#x27;s practically impossible to measure their values. We only know the result (i.e. the left side), but not as a measurement, only as a state, so to speak.<p>- I can see that thinking about the potential and adversity as separate terms might be useful if someone beats themselves about wasted potential, but then can look at the equation to remind themselves that the potential is always tied with adversity, they go hand in hand together and looking only at the potential is like looking at your assets but not on your mortgage.<p>- Another useful angle of the equation might be that if someone is beating themselves about not working to decrease the adversity, then they might notice that working on it would &quot;consume&quot; the potential points! (E.g. time is required to use your potential, but if you spend it on dealing with adversity..). (But then it might be dangerous as it also conveys they idea there is a measurable, standalone thing called &quot;one&#x27;s true potential&quot;, which I don&#x27;t believe exists.)<p>&gt; People implicitly assume the &#x27;adversity&#x27; term is negligible.<p>I thought about it for a short while and my take would be that people share (discuss) their adversities with others all the time, but when it comes to formulating the equation they often tend to end up with sth like:<p><pre><code>    expectedAndMandatoryAchievement(person) = perceivedHighPotential(person) &#x2F;* - adversity(person) *&#x2F;\n</code></pre>\nI guess I&#x27;m saying that people don&#x27;t think the adversity is negligible, but they tend to completely cover it with a newspaper when thinking about the potential vs reality.<p>And this is a straight path to depression...<p>OK, let me end here! I hope my LLM didn&#x27;t hallucinate too much, but it&#x27;s closer to stream of consciousness than to well though out arguments, so buyers beware!<p>Last but not least, thank you for a great prompt--it made me think about the topic from a different angle!\n\nIt’s probably a bad idea, but having a child seems to have made things significantly better in some ways. I’m still prone to anxiety, but existential fears have been greatly reduced.<p>I attribute this mostly to lack of time to think too much, so you can probably find different ways to achieve the same effect.<p>I think somewhere along the way I’ve also become adult enough to realize that there will be days I accomplish absolutely nothing and that that is fine.<p>I stop comparing myself to the best people in the world, and start comparing myself to the best people in my immediate environment, and I feel a great deal better about myself.\n\n  &gt; but having a child seems to have made things significantly better in some ways<p>A child answers the existentialist &quot;why I&#x27;m here? what&#x27;s the point?&quot; question on a primal, fundamental level. The child needs you, your purpose is to care for it.\n\n    This phase lasts until they are teenagers, and the questions come back but stronger.<p>Unless you enjoy the answer to &quot;why I&#x27;m here&quot; being &quot;driving my teen around to hang with their dubious friends&quot;, &quot;nagging about homework&quot;, and &quot;human paycheque.&quot;<p>Just sayin&#x27; :-)<p>I love my kids, but children are not the answer to getting meaning into your life. Having a mid-life crisis in your late 40s &amp; 50s long after you&#x27;ve had kids is a cliche for a reason.\n\n      eh, life expectancy for US males is 77 by that point you&#x27;re practically dead (sarcasm). More generally, worrying about a mid-life crisis feels silly and probably only compounds angst.\n\n      I&#x27;m not that far along with my kids, but from my friends &amp; family I see some examples of involved parents having a very close relationship with their children well into their adult years.<p>&gt; children are not the answer to getting meaning into your life<p>Because the meaning may end (after many years&#x2F;decades)? That seems strange, what answer to this hunger for meaning is guaranteed to fulfill you forever?\n\n        I&#x27;m pretty close to both my teens. But the relationship shifts. And every month you feel that they &quot;need&quot; you less.  And they tend to go through a phase in mid-adolescence when they really make that clear, too...<p>If your primary answer to the question <i>&quot;why I&#x27;m here? what&#x27;s the point?&quot;</i> is taking care of your kids, you&#x27;re going to end up with a widening gap as they age into adulthood, move out, and you spend and spend less time with them and they become more independent.<p>Oh well, I&#x27;ll get back to you in 5-10 years when they&#x27;ve fully adult-ed.\n\n          &gt; If your primary answer to the question &quot;why I&#x27;m here? what&#x27;s the point?&quot; is taking care of your kids, you&#x27;re going to end up with a widening gap as they age into adulthood, move out, and you spend and spend less time with them and they become more independent.<p>It&#x27;s my primary answer which will do its job for many years. Again, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll find a life-long meaning in building a B2B startup. It might work for a couple of years, then you need to find something else.\n\n      Maybe, that gives you 10-15 years before you have to consider the question again :)\n\n  &gt;It&#x27;s probably a bad idea\n\n  This answer is IMO a strong distractive strategy. I don&#x27;t have children, but as a former gamer, I do know a thing or two about distraction! What I found: after the distraction has run its course, it will come back to you.<p>Distraction suppresses. It doesn&#x27;t actually allow you to work through it.<p>That&#x27;s my experience at least.\n\n    Some things cannot be worked through. Sometimes a distraction lasts long enough for things to sort themselves out. That&#x27;s my experience, at least.\n\n    See your sibling comment:<p>&gt; A child answers the existentialist &quot;why I&#x27;m here? what&#x27;s the point?&quot; question on a primal, fundamental level. The child needs you, your purpose is to care for it.<p>A child is not a distraction from something else, they become your entire purpose.\n\n  I&#x27;ve had the same experience with kids.<p>After having kids, I&#x27;m living more day-to-day, and I don&#x27;t care about so many things I used to care about.<p>For me, seeing my kids smile washes away any feelings of anxiety and dread.\n\n    I suppose this is one benefit of having kids young: you can go straight from school into a purposeful life without the intervening anxiety and dread that a lot  of people experience.<p>I was one year out of grad school (age 24) when my son was born. My peers are just now having their kids 10 years later, but I definitely don&#x27;t regret it.\n\nDrugs (methylphenidate, better known as &quot;ritalin&quot; in the US)\n\n  Concerta for me, but the same result. I feel a lot more stable and optimistic about the future. AND I get things done instead of sitting on the couch in a daze.\n\nGetting back with friends helped me a lot. I have been living in another country for a while without close friends. Once I have moved to my  _real_ friends for a few months, my symptoms have improved a lot.\n\nForgive yourself.\n\nYou&#x27;re just a person like anyone else. Let go of the idea that you&#x27;re special. Also forgive yourself like you&#x27;d forgive someone else telling you the same story. Don&#x27;t hold yourself to a standard you wouldn&#x27;t hold someone else to.\n\nfor me i feel totally detached from my work, it&#x27;s just a means to an end, a salary<p>as such i find it very difficult to care beyond doing the minimum not to get fired<p>yet the work gets ever more complex and layered with technical bureaucracy and ever changing landscape of idiots to deal with<p>i am planning to quit by eoy. thats my solution. life is too short to waste it.\n\nMaybe you need to reframe or challenge your beliefs.<p>Research emotional biases. A combination of believing in your own specialness, loss aversion and retrospectiveness can be a toxic combination.\n\nThe best advice I been given: “when your problems seem overwhelming, get busy solving other people’s problems. Not only will you feel good about helping others and get that feeling of productivity, seeing what others are dealing with will also give you perspective on your own problems and a renewed sense of hope and energy”. Volunteer somewhere. Help a friend out. But try to do it in person where you can get more of that human connection.\n\n  &gt; The best advice I been given: “when your problems seem overwhelming, get busy solving other people’s problems. …”<p>As someone in the midst of trying this I can tell you personally it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. I think I’m starting to realize that this person is beyond my capability to help and all the time I’ve wasted helping them could have been spent improving my own situation\n\n    &gt; I think I’m starting to realize that this person is beyond my capability to help and all the time I’ve wasted helping them could have been spent improving my own situation<p>From my personal environment: there are many people that are beyond my capability to help.\n\n    &gt; it’s not all it’s cracked up to be<p>&gt; this person is beyond my capability to help<p>I think there&#x27;s something to be said about the difference between &quot;solving other people&#x27;s problems&quot; and &quot;solving someone&#x27;s problems&quot;. If the whole idea is to not be so invested into one life and get perspective, volunteering somewhere ought to be on a different league then trying to sort one specific person&#x27;s life.\n\n    Yep!<p>It sucks, but libertarians were right. ;p\n\n  Came here to recommend doing good deeds for others. I find when I&#x27;m doing things for the benefit others I feel a lot better (as long as I&#x27;m resourced enough to do it). A therapist used to tell me that gratitude and doing good things for others were the most effective evidence-based behavioral interventions for depression.<p>That said, depression, fear, and lack of confidence are multi-faceted things with many different mitigating and exacerbating causes. Even diet and digestive ability can play a role! I find light exercise to mitigate the effects, too. But a sense of warm-heartedness toward yourself and others will be helpful no matter what.\n\none small success at a time. Its a very deep mantra once you start applying in life.\n\n&gt;  I&#x27;m certain there are many on here who had high potential and feel they&#x27;ve squandered it.<p>I had the same feeling, I still do to some extent. But genuinely, I also have noticed that society isn&#x27;t equipped to deal with my high potential. My issue is: I want to stay authentic, I find it (morally&#x2F;ethically) hard to put on a mask or role. Therefore, I bring my whole self to a job interview.<p>The problem with that is that: suppose you&#x27;d order a coffee at your local coffee chain and you see the barista, and they would bring their whole self while making you that coffee. How would you feel about that? You&#x27;d think &quot;I only wanted a coffee, but now I also have to deal with all this extra stuff.&quot; That extra stuff may be good or bad, but it&#x27;s still overhead. Well, that&#x27;s the problem I&#x27;m running into when applying for jobs. No one in my family could&#x27;ve told me that this would happen. It wasn&#x27;t part of my upbringing. No one at uni told me this. I had to painfully piece this together myself.<p>A large part of society doesn&#x27;t fully get integrated into work culture. Some people fix this by being okay with lying or bending the truth. I wasn&#x27;t. However, the workplace is not the welcoming environment that university is. At university all one has to do is to show that they&#x27;re ambitious and work their asses off. That&#x27;s not the case in the workplace. The mechanics are much more tribal, and also culturally different.<p>I wasn&#x27;t prepared for it and I wasn&#x27;t willing to sacrifice my integrity over it. So yea, my high potential simply could not have been utilized.<p>Also, it shows that markets are inefficient. The market incentives for me to find a job aren&#x27;t strong enough and the market incentives for companies to find me and use my talents aren&#x27;t strong enough either. I&#x27;m convinced there are companies out there that I&#x27;d be able to transform due to a personality&#x2F;culture&#x2F;skill fit. However, both me and those companies are having an incredibly hard time finding each other. To be fair, it&#x27;s not an easy task. And market dynamics sure aren&#x27;t fully solving it with the &quot;invisible hand&quot; that it offers.<p>It is what it is. I choose to stay as optimistic as possible.\n\n  &gt;&gt; And market dynamics sure aren&#x27;t fully solving it with the &quot;invisible hand&quot; that it offers.<p>If I take my ideological glasses off for a second its kinda obvious why - invisible hand is just and &quot;observation&quot; dressed in lots of wishful thinking from economists.\nIn reality it is just useful model that almost always fails if you look close enough<p>&gt;&gt; The market incentives for me to find a job aren&#x27;t strong enough and the market incentives for companies to find me and use my talents aren&#x27;t strong enough either.<p>But on the other hand - you seems somehow not to notice that todays world is all about team work and the only way most people can test you on this is by using their intuition -so if you feel off to them they will write you off as not a cultural fit and by all means they may be right - the harsh truth is that there is not many people that want to work with people that are true to themselfs (which usually means they have all barriers and filters discarded and are at best annoying and at worst offensive)\n\n    It&#x27;s the assholes who say &quot;I am being me, deal with it&quot; as an excuse to get away with bad&#x2F;rude behaviour without actually knowing what their true self is\n\n      You&#x27;re currently labeling a group of people as assholes that seem to say something similar to what I wrote. Please assume that I&#x27;m commenting in good faith [1]. I can mask my behavior as well and I have done at places, it sucks. HN is not a place where I want to do this.<p>&gt; Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize. Assume good faith.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>\n\n        I am not labelling you an asshole, I am saying there are people who use that as an excuse and this group make the other group look bad\n\n          Fair enough, I can see that.\n\n    &gt; the harsh truth is that there is not many people that want to work with people that are true to themselfs (which usually means they have all barriers and filters discarded and are at best annoying and at worst offensive)<p>That&#x27;s what I was trying to depict with coffee&#x2F;barista example. The example highlights the problem: the customer simply wants coffee brought to him, not to meet a new person - perhaps for a small quick back &#x27;n forth chat but that&#x27;s it. In the work force, people see other people mostly for the services they provide first and foremost and they want it to be a pleasant interaction. They don&#x27;t care about you, they care about (1) the service and (2) it being pleasant&#x2F;positive. I get it, I also find it dehumanizing, but I get it.<p>And it is a harsh truth. I&#x27;ve tested to put my morals&#x2F;ethics away and just mask my behavior. Suddenly I jive much better in the work force. The only thing I don&#x27;t jive well with when I do that is my own conscience.<p>&gt; so if you feel off to them they will write you off as not a cultural fit and by all means they may be right<p>What I was trying to depict in my previous comment: the harsh truth is that not everyone is enculturated to fit in. Some people never got a real chance to get the memo. That&#x27;s how talent is wasted. It&#x27;s an unequal playing field. This is especially true for people in economical disadvantaged positions.<p>For example, a friend of mine is a teacher and he teaches some economical disadvantaged boys. Those boys believe that being able to beat someone up is actual strength and what it means to be a man. They care about all the stereotype things that a person cares about when living the &quot;thug life&quot;. Some will grow up like that in their adulthood, in my experience. For them, it&#x27;s tough to integrate into any working lifestyle simply because they&#x27;ve had a traumatic past where no one had the culture of trying to solve conflicts with words rather than with violence (speaking from enough experience). Schools try to correct for this and are failing, and I&#x27;m speaking from experience in the Netherlands. I can&#x27;t even imagine what the US is like.<p>It&#x27;s an unequal playing field. I&#x27;ve made my peace with that a long time ago since being born in NL is also unequal. But given that, it bares to be repeated. How you grow up determines a lot of how you&#x27;re encultured into the work force.\n\nIt&#x27;s difficult. If you can&#x27;t find someone who truly cares about you, might as well getting a job, any job, ASAP.\n\nGo back to the basics.<p>Being part of this community, I&#x27;d suspect that there&#x27;s a high probability of you being &quot;in your mind&quot; a lot of the time. Don&#x27;t forget that that world up there is mostly conceptual. The map is not the terrain. The map is a lot more stressful. If you want to stay conservative, just change things up a bit to involve your body a bit more. If you&#x27;re more radical, reinvent yourself completely. Some suggestions:<p>&gt; For those who have been there and managed to get out and are now living a life you&#x27;re proud of, how did you do it?<p>I&#x27;ll answer the above question first:<p>- If you have the savings, travel. Plenty of places where it&#x27;s the plane ticket that&#x27;ll be the costliest expense. If you have the freedom, go for many months. Get a few books on topics you want to learn and go work through them from a place where the cost of living is permissive.<p>- Start taking courses in an unrelated, more &quot;grounded&quot;, field (cooking, plumbing, masonry, woodworking, etc).<p>- If you already have some other skills, try turning them into a small business. Don&#x27;t aim to change the world. Aim for basic cost of living before anything. Don&#x27;t optimize your business for anything further until you have reached that goal. Premature optimizations will kill your business before whatever inefficiencies your analytical mind will undoubtedly spot very early in the process. Keep things super simple and non-optimal until it&#x27;s absolutely clear that some factorization has short-term benefits.<p>- Find a physical activity to practice regularly. Don&#x27;t rush the progress, savor it. Swimming, a martial art, yoga, etc.<p>&gt; Depression, unemployment, lack of confidence, fear. I&#x27;m certain there are many on here who had high potential and feel they&#x27;ve squandered it.<p>I&#x27;m leaving this here in the spirit that you might be interested in trying a different approach to experiencing life. If this doesn&#x27;t resonate with you, that&#x27;s ok too.<p>The &quot;squandering&quot; of life is an outlook to it that is the product of cultural beliefs that we&#x27;re meant to do &quot;something meaningful&quot;. There&#x27;s no evidence that there&#x27;s a way to fail or waste life. There&#x27;s reason to believe that every experience of it is valid. I&#x27;d suggest to start with some topics in philosophy as an entry point. Our culture is predominantly materialist and our thinking patterns generally already align like this, so I suggest to counter-balance that bias with contents in eastern thought (Alan Watts is a good entry point), idealism (A. Schopenhauer, Bernardo Kastrup), and stoicism (Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius). This might help you expose possible underlying cultural beliefs you&#x27;re operating from and why they&#x27;re possibly wrong. Philosophy alone can raise existential questions. I <i>strongly</i> advise to supplement that exploration with a nondual contemplative practice where you will learn to explore and perhaps solve your version of &quot;the world&#x27;s problems&quot;, from within. Some good authors&#x2F;speakers that I can suggest to begin with would be Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti, and Rupert Spira.<p>Good luck.\n\nRegarding unemployment, in my brief experience of that, that does sap confidence, more than one might expect. And conversely, starting back at work seems to fix it instantly. At least it did for me.. 20 yrs ago I returned from some time out of Tech and some time spent travelling, it took me about 3 months to get a job at that time, it was new year, market was still not recovered from dot-com bust, and I was starting to get a bit despondent. But literally 30 mins after starting the new job, boom, life&#x27;s back on track again. Like a switch flicked. I think the moral of the story is sometimes, take the first decent job you can even if its not a perfect fit.\n\nI&#x27;m a believer in inertia. When you&#x27;re at rest, getting going is hard. When you&#x27;re in motion, staying in motion is easy.<p>So what I do when I&#x27;m in a rut is literally anything. Take on a hobby project, learn something new, do volunteer work, anything. I just force myself to do something. The important thing is to get into a state of motion. Exactly what that motion looks like isn&#x27;t important. Once moving, you can change directions.\n\n  Similarly, I think of it as &quot;if things aren&#x27;t working, <i>something</i> has to change&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t matter what changes as long as something does. It both proves that change is possible and the world doesn&#x27;t end with change.\n\nLet me know if you find anything that works for you.\n\nI&#x27;ve recently been in a rut and while I still have a lot further to go I&#x27;ve been feeling better over the last couple of days and here&#x27;s what helped:<p>- going to therapy<p>- taking PTO<p>- going outside<p>- hanging out with friends<p>- cooking a meal<p>- going on a date<p>- going to LA and getting sun<p>- reconnecting with old friends<p>I&#x27;m not out yet but I feel like with some time and effort I can be. How did I do it? I think there are really two parts of this - helping others and asking for help. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the first but never done the second and that was really holding me back.\n\nMy perspective continues to change, and my feelings about death increasingly line up with what I&#x27;ve liked to say for years: &quot;I accept that I will die and I&#x27;m okay with that.&quot; I&#x27;m in no hurry to die, mind; life is wonderful, even when it&#x27;s shit (well, like a cold shower, it&#x27;s a lot better once I&#x27;m through the shit). Increasingly I&#x27;m okay with who I am, where I am, and what I&#x27;ve done, freeing me up to do what I really want to do.<p>Mentally converting a lot of my physical stuff into shit to give away (so much gratitude to George Carlin), and actually giving it away (no regrets for any of it, either), has been a huge part of this process.\n\nWhen I travel, I&#x27;ll take all my luggage out and put it back in, do laundry, shave, etc. Basically, a reset. Then I&#x27;ll treat myself to something familiar, maybe watch a movie I love. It&#x27;s a good way to ground myself again and start afresh.<p>Longer ruts seem to come from routine and aimlessness. I find that giving myself time without devices or entertainment helps. A bicycle ride is a good way to clear one&#x27;s mind.\n\nI went anonymous for this one and it&#x27;s all my fault. I really messed up. I had it all- wife, stepkids, job, homes. I had a good life. I miss my old life. I miss my baby. But it&#x27;s all gone now and I can never have it back.<p>I basically lost everything... due to my own paranoia and listening to family members I shouldn&#x27;t have listened to who didn&#x27;t agree with my marriage to begin with, I complained to the wrong people when I should have just gone directly to my wife about my concerns and I let them bud into my life for no reason.<p>Now my wife is gone, and soon after I lost my job, then as I was driving around getting rid of my belongings, the wheel of my car fell off and then my car was gone, and then I had to sell my properties to get myself out of debt.<p>And I had just enough to buy a new used car. then I got a job working for a company that provided me with a company vehicle, and then I do some DoorDashing after work when I can. Both are helping me make the payments on the vehicle. I&#x27;m technically living out of my personal car. My realtor was nice enough to lend me his driveway to park the company vehicle. I&#x27;m over his house a few days a week to pick up the company car for work and they usually put me up in motels or hotels around the state so it takes care of my housing needs when I&#x27;m not sleeping in my car. It&#x27;s just a contract job and will probably be over in a few months but it works for now. Once it ends, I&#x27;m planning to leave the state to somewhere warm if I don&#x27;t kill myself first.<p>I made a few really bad decisions that cost me everything. I won&#x27;t get into it as I already mentioned the consequences of my actions. I destroyed my life. I am now just living a very quiet life. I removed my social media presence. I&#x27;m not much involved in the tech world anymore. And I&#x27;m living mostly like a nomad. Life as I knew it is gone. I fight depression everyday... hoping I don&#x27;t wake up, sometimes wondering if I should just drive into oncoming traffic or off a cliff and hopefully that will take care of things. After I lost my wife, I tried starving myself for nearly 6 months in hopes for death, but all I did was lose 50 pounds. I&#x27;m just existing now. I lost all purpose in my life.\n\n  Thank you for sharing.<p>Life rarely fails to prove that there is no limit to how bad it can get. Perhaps all our grand narratives of love and moral truth are the veil we keep between ourselves and the undeniable reality of what everything at some point decays into.<p>I think what <i>is</i> important is that you are alive. You can still think. You still have the freedom to create a future. Far more paths lie ahead for you than what is easy to imagine.<p>This is a little cheesy, but if anything, I promise you this. Reading what you have written, I will, with serious aim, seek to be to a better person to myself, my family, and those I may come to know in my life. I have not been perfect, I have wasted so much time, but as long as I am alive, I have free will; I can choose.<p>I want you to remember then that the path I&#x27;m now set on, whatever greater amount of good that I do than I would have otherwise, it was because of you.\n\n  There is always another chance. As long as your heart is beating, your body is functioning, there is hope, even for the hopeless.<p>Try and find a source of strength and connect with it, then it will give you the hope and strength you don’t have now. Or it may be a friend, a religion, God, a community, a historical figure, a living figure, that energy is out there and when you connect with it you will feel it again.<p>I hope you find it, sending a healthy portion of blessings your way.\n\nTreat yourself as a marginal factor, not the totality. You bear some brunt for what&#x27;s happening in your life- but not the majority of it. So focus on what&#x27;s inside of your control.<p>I have a weird life. I&#x27;ve had years where all the wind was in my sail and life was bussin, bad bitches and making money. I&#x27;ve had years where literally nothing I did worked, everything was useless.<p>You&#x27;d be surprised how many variables are actually outside of your control. Does everyone love you? Does everyone hate you? People can and will blow hot and cold.<p>It&#x27;s better to have a value set and just stick to it. Whether you want to be a CEO or live under a bridge. Anchor yourself in something worth believing in, even if attitudes around your values shift around.<p>This is how you maintain self-respect no matter how well or how poorly your life is going.\n\nTL&#x27;DR: friends..if you can find any.<p>I&#x27;m in the same place.  After TED talks and much self guiding&#x2F;discovery materials.  I realize it really comes down to friends or at least someone you can confide in without judgement.  Although therapist can help, but that just a guide.  You still need to find friendships.  I can&#x27;t lose faith in humanity but omg...it&#x27;s so *ukin hard.  Worse for me as fulltime dad of a toddler where my times are mostly preoccupied so ideally for me.  Need someone else who&#x27;s going through the same.<p>Ex prgm mgr, coder from FAANGM now triaging my zillion side prj ideas for gold, but same..everyday is a struggle. Can&#x27;t focus, lack motivation and direction.\n\nI decided to downsize my life by selling a relatively expensive car and my condo and see how long I can go without working.<p>I have no desire to go back to frontend development even though I can make way more doing that than anything else.<p>I&#x27;m hoping in a year or so I&#x27;ll be ready to get back into tech, but right now I have no desire to. So much of the industry just seems toxic to my mental health.\n\n  Same problem here. It doesn’t get better in my experience, the more you stay away the less you want to go back in. Over the last 15 years I estime I’ve worked 50% overall. This time I haven’t been working for over 2 years."

If you do not consider a new summer flooding area or you calculated that the frozen terrain was estable to build and now it melts. Underground currents can slowly create problems.\n\n    oh phew that&#x27;s a relief, I&#x27;m glad one of these feedback loops is positive at least\n\n  What do you plan to eat in Alaska ?\n\n    Moose, caribou, root vegetables (including the largest and sweetest carrots I&#x27;ve ever had), salmon, trout, halibut...\n\n      Many of them, like salmon, aren&#x27;t doing so well.\n\n      Yeah those things need to survive climate change sorry.\n\nAs I understand it (and I would like to know if this is wrong). Carbon dioxide emissions take 5-10 years for their heating impact to work through into warming.<p>So even if we could get to net zero today we&#x27;d still be in for 5-10 years of worsening impacts.<p>And we&#x27;re not even talking about getting to net zero today. Even in the UK where we&#x27;ve exported and reduced emissions a long way net zero by 2035 is seen as a wildly optimistic scenario.<p>So it seems to me inevitable that we&#x27;re going to need to do geoengineering. We mustn&#x27;t let this delay emission reduction but I think at this point we should get to where we&#x27;re going asap so we can research it properly.\n\n  I believe that&#x27;s untrue, stopping emissions stops warming more or less instantly. Co2 captures energy the first day it is floating around in the air.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think you got it right, the rate of warming depends on the concentration (i.e. the total amount) of GHGs in the atmosphere, not the rate at which they&#x27;re emitted. GHGs basically reflect (actually absorb and re-emit) some of Earth&#x27;s thermal radiation back to the surface, they act as an &quot;insulator&quot; (a greenhouse) just by being there.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greenhouse_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greenhouse_effect</a>\n\n      Yes that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying\n\n  &gt; So it seems to me inevitable that we&#x27;re going to need to do geoengineering.<p>Nobody knows how to do that at scale and for a time frame long enough and safely (although there are experiments all over the place). Stopping fossil fuels, moving to renewable and nuclear, using less energy is the only known and safe way. And for the rest of time, adapt (which, depending on the speed of our efforts, will mean less people in uninhabitable zones and migrations or, if we&#x27;re too slow: wars).\n\n    Safe for who? How are we going to extract the resources required for that clean energy transition without further habitat destruction? Energy is IMO a red herring, yes energy is needed to maintain our current way of life. But what about all the other species we share this world with? Spoiler, the unsustainable part is modernity <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dothemath.ucsd.edu&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;lets-make-a-deal&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dothemath.ucsd.edu&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;lets-make-a-deal&#x2F;</a>\n\n    &quot;Stopping fossil fuels, moving to renewable and nuclear, using less energy&quot; is great. None of it just doesn&#x27;t reverse climate change even a little. It just means we have dialed the oven regulator from 3 to 2. The oven will reach maximum temperature anyway, just a little slower.<p>Geoengineering is not similar thing to the emission reduction initiatives, it is a completely different idea with a completely different result in the end. You can&#x27;t substitute one for another.\n\n  Perhaps geo engineering isn&#x27;t such a great idea? <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;AgLi8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;AgLi8</a><p>Also - just to show that we know almost nothing about unintended consequences - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1029&#x2F;2022GL099381\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1029&#x2F;2022GL09...</a>\n\n  Assuming that&#x27;s correct about 5-10 years (though honestly I doubt it takes that long). The question is - why do you assume that after 10 years gas suddenly stops heating atmosphere? Gas will stay there for the practical purpose &quot;forever&quot;, enough to heat atmosphere for thousands of years.\n\nMore discussion here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39755758\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39755758</a>\n\nAnything will blow off the charts if you have the wrong scale.<p>Not saying this isn&#x27;t bad, its just such a silly headline.\n\n  If you measure something that has catastrophic consequences if it gets “too big” and later find out that the measurement understated things then that is disconcerting.  The headline seems appropriate.\n\n  Let’s hope we have the wrong scale then.\n\n    Why? That won&#x27;t save you.<p>I feel like the responses to my comment do not understand what a scale is or what it means for something to go off it.\n\n      I understand those things. I must be misinterpreting the point in your original comment. Elaborate if you can be bothered.\n\n      &gt;Anything will blow off the charts if you have the wrong scale.<p>&gt;I feel like the responses to my comment do not understand what a scale is or what it means for something to go off it.<p>Readers understand the comment and understand what a scale is.<p>HN readers are notoriously critical of comments that don&#x27;t add substantively to the discussion. Language is often used in ways that extend beyond the direct literal meaning of the words. and maximally pedantic interpretations ceased to be interesting a long time ago for most HN readers.<p>Also, in practice, chart scales and scale heights are generally an implicit measure of historical data range and variability, so if something blows past the top of the chart, even in a maximally literal interpretation, that is commonly a sign that something significant has happened in the signal being charted.\n\nBanning sulphur from ship exhausts might&#x27;ve been a mistake\n\n  For a clarification. as a thought experiment ask the question &quot;Why can volcanoes cause global cooling events.&quot; and approach the answer as an engineering challenge.\n\n    I’m not sure I want a man made volcano. What exactly do you have in mind?\n\n      It is one of those things that is a terrible supervillain type idea. Ill founded and very prone to be hit the worst way by the law of unintended side effects. But it is also fun to think about as a sort of evil what if.<p>Volcanoes emit a lot... I mean an extreme amount of co2. They are also associated with global cooling events. This does not match general greenhouse carbon theory. So you go digging in to find out why. and the answer is complex but one major reason is that they also emit a lot of sulfur dioxide and sulpher dioxide has a negative greenhouse coefficient. that is, when found in the upper atmosphere it has a net cooling effect.<p>So you do a little mustache twirl, give an evil cackle, and  proclaim &quot;It is a shame we worked so hard to remove sulfur from our fuels.&quot; I mean acid rain was not really all that bad, was it? When really in the mood I also like to conclude with &quot;The obvious thing to do is to add additional sulfur into jet fuels&quot;<p>The final fun thing to do after you have just become an internet expert(that is you read the wikipedia page) on greenhouse theory. Is to inform people that water vapor has 10 times the greenhouse coefficient of co2. I will leave it to the reader to figure out why this both is and is not a problem.\n\n  From previous discussions here on hn and their linked sources, it seemed to me like sulphur only made up for a small amount of the total change, even though it was sometimes touted as an &quot;obvious solution&quot; by the kinds of people who think climate change is no problem, since we can easily geoengineer our way out of it.<p>I generally approach such claims with scepticism, as i feel like they often start with a conclusion and then work backwards from there, with an unrealistic dose of optimism on the way. That type of discussion tends to delay the discussion of more serious and practical measures.\n\n    while one thing doing a big difference is unlikely, i do believe we could geo-engineer our way out of this, especially if we put AI agents at the task - the problem is can we get the right power brokers to stop pushing it off until tomorrow and fix it today?<p>We could plant billions of trees around utah and colorado and reroute pacific ocean water via pipeline to existing and new man-made lakes in these areas, the sea water evaporating giving rise to more rain and ending some of the draught issues for one...<p>Another idea is A nation-wide network of pipes where every city is a part of a grid that sends water where it needs to be when it needs to be there... less waist, less struggles for places without needed water.. etc...<p>A big space shield could do wonders at least for cooling us down some... perhaps it could double as some sort of energy system that beams down energy in the form of a laser or something, I think i read that somewhere..<p>Lots of different ways to capture co2&#x2F;methane.. I mean couldn&#x27;t factories just run exhause pipes into very deep holes in the ground instead of releasing into the air? Or buy filters to put on every smoke stack..<p>I&#x27;m no scientist, but i think there&#x27;s a million other ideas out there to geoengineer thigns.....we just need to act...and nobody wants to do that... we waste so much human energy on mundane tasks -- like looking for food because we were born poor, that if we just eliminate poverty and put all the would be  homeless on the path towards being scientists, we could have an entire new civ in 20 years..maybe without climate change being such a big deal.<p>We have the ability to do amazing things, we&#x27;ve done them before, we just lack the global unity and will to even try.\n\nI&#x27;m just so surprised<p>On one hand it seems we do so many &quot;green deals&quot; that it&#x27;s basically impossible to manufacture anything in Europe anymore, and every house has a solar panel (made in China), and there are electric cars roaming the streets<p>On the other hand it seems it doesn&#x27;t really help?\n\n  &gt; impossible to manufacture anything in Europe anymore<p>&gt; every house has a solar panel<p>&gt; there are electric cars [in significant amounts]<p>Not one of these things is true.\n\n  Why are you surprised? The amount of greehouse gasses in the atmosphere is only increases, and nobody is meaningfully removing it. Of course heating will continue, even if emissions will suddenly really go to zero (which they are not).\n\n  The vast majority of cars I see burn fossil fuels and I rarely see a solar panel on a house. Where are you living to have such a radically green experience?\n\n    Also, the worst polluters are militaries and various industries that arguably may or may not actually need to exist.\n\n      The big &quot;4&quot; climate change sources:<p>- transportation\n- electricity generation\n- heating\n- agriculture<p>everything else is single digit percentages.   Those single digit percentages can still be massive numbers (aka a billion tons of CO2e per year for cement production), but they aren&#x27;t &quot;worst polluters&quot;.\n\n        Military famously doesn’t get counted in these.\n\n  It&#x27;s impossible to say for sure whether and how much the efforts helped, because we don&#x27;t know the alternative. If we hadn&#x27;t done those things, maybe the indicators would be 20% worse. Maybe 40%. Maybe 1%. We literally don&#x27;t know.<p>I do know that if you are in a car headed for a brick wall at 50 mph, taking your foot off of the gas is a good idea.\n\nDisclaimer: I am 100% convinced climate change is real and humans have some influence in it.<p>My question: do we even know what the baselines are?\nIf we look at the history of the world climate has never been constant. So on one hand I am afraid humans messed up, on the other hand it&#x27;s very difficult to see if the current climate change is totally caused by humans. Especially now El Niño is causing changes all around the world.\n\n  Adding a disclaimer to a denialist &quot;just asking questions&quot; talking point doesn&#x27;t really convince me of sincerity these days. I suppose it could depend on what you mean by history though. If we look at the history of the world, humans basically haven&#x27;t existed and I&#x27;m thinking probably won&#x27;t for very long.\n\n  You don&#x27;t need our permission to read the literature on ice core drilling and DNA sampling going back 800K - 2 million years.\n\n  You&#x27;re asking the wrong question.   There is no baseline, no natural temperature.  The &quot;baseline&quot; temperature has and will change over millions of years.<p>The right question is about the rate of change.   If the temperature changes slowly, ecosystems adapt and migrate.   If it changes quickly, they cannot.<p>Changing a degree or two over ~10,000 years appears to have happened relatively often.  This causes some species loss, but in general the ecosystem thrives.<p>Changing a few degrees over hundreds of years is a leading theory of the cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest extinction event since the oxygenation of the atmosphere.<p>Changing a few degrees over decades?   We&#x27;re going to find out."

      "conversation_text": "What’s the status on companies building AI models to build actual 3D backend behind these generative videos. Anyone working on something similar? Imagine that’d be far more productive. For example, lookdev mlop is pretty low hanging fruit. Not sure why we don’t already have models from Autodesk, Epic or even Adobe (with resources ie A100&#x2F;H100) where you upload an image&#x2F;video and the model spits out workable 3D scaffolds.\n\n  If I’m not mistaken, Stability just released something like that a few days ago.\n\n    Looks like I completely overlooked threestudio released last year. Thank you for pointing it out.\n\n      It’s something I’ve been interested in too. I do a bunch of CNC woodworking so would love the ability to atleast generate close enough 3D models I can then refine.\n\n    Yes, but it works by generating a video first and doing photogrammetry on it to produce a 3D model.\n\n  This is a good question, and the answer is that from a tech side it is surprisingly easier to solve the problem in the reverse direction.<p>As in, making workable 3d models is harder than making video.<p>And it is easier to make a 3d model by generating a video of the object instead.<p>Why is that? I don&#x27;t know. But that&#x27;s the current state of the industry. 3D model generation is simply harder.\n\n    I am thinking reinforcement on top of Blender would be straight forward with unlimited synthetic data potential. I’ve come across people incorporating SD into rendering workflow so tools are all there.\n\n    Probably also helps that there&#x27;s way more image&#x2F;video data to train on than 3D data.\n\n  Nerfs and splatting\n\nI don&#x27;t get how transformers can replace convolutional networks. My understanding is patches get fed in, and the transformer will do the same thing that a convolution layer does. But transformers deal with sequential data and I don&#x27;t see any of that here?\n\n  I think it just treats the patches like it would be sequentially in memory or disk, but also has coordinates.  And they have overlapping patches at an offset to catch features that would span a patch and be missed at that level.\n\n  Transformers are not limited to sequential data. They can process any form of data you can tokenize, as long as they have enough of it to learn the patterns and structures it contains.\n\n  A transformers model was probably chosen because of its scaling properties and because it&#x27;s easy to mask the attention layer so that you can fit in the same batch multiple video and images of different lengths and dimensions, this is important because every batch needs to be the same size to fit in the same mini-batch and for performance reasons.\n\n    From the fine article:<p>&gt; Now for the second point, both DiT and Sora replace the commonly-used U-Net architecture with a vanilla Transformer architecture. This matters because the authors of the DiT paper observe that using Transformers leads to predictable scaling: As you apply more training compute (either by training the model for longer or making the model larger, or both), you obtain better performance. The Sora technical report notes the same but for videos and includes a useful illustration.<p>&gt; This scaling behavior, which can be quantified by so-called scaling laws, is an important property and it has been studied before in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and for autoregressive models on other modalities. The ability to apply scale to obtain better models was one of the key drivers behind the rapid progress on LLMs. Since the same property exists for image and video generation, we should expect the same scaling recipe to work here, too.\n\nI don&#x27;t understand, from the article, how Sora works when handling a rotation of an object on another object (the leaves in the leaf covered elefant for example). The explanation goes only to the diffussion model, but not to how, from that model, a correct geometry deformation is derived at each step.\n\nA great write up.<p>The elephant in the room, of course, is &quot;where did Sora&#x27;s dataset come from?&quot;\n\n  This is only a made-up issue for a few that are looking for something to criticize. Almost nobody cares, in the sense that appears to be meant here about &quot;ownership&quot; of the training data. Any this unfortunately hampers research and understanding of models because companies are reluctant to talk about training lest the trolls start jumping on. We&#x27;re all worse off because of this.\n\n    What a short-sighted view.<p>Having open access to the training data is how you prevent poisoning&#x2F;biasing of the dataset. People complaining about bad data in the dataset improve the quality of the dataset. That&#x27;s in addition to the benefit of creators being labeled in the dataset.<p>Hiding the data from public view seems to only helps nefarious actors.\n\n      Pretty sure we&#x27;re saying the same thing\n\n        &gt; Any this unfortunately hampers research and understanding of models because companies are reluctant to talk about training lest the trolls start jumping on<p>Respecting artists and being open about training data should go hand in hand. That companies feel the need to hide the training data from public scrutiny should immediately be suspect.<p>It seems like you are saying no one cares about copyright, I inform you that is not the case. I disagree with (most current forms of) copyright, but I do respect artists and their need to feed themselves. Proper attribution, and labeling and scrutiny of the dataset is imperative.<p>&gt;This is only a made-up issue for a few that are looking for something to criticize. Almost nobody cares, in the sense that appears to be meant here about &quot;ownership&quot; of the training data<p>So it&#x27;s not just &#x27;trolls&#x27; that want the data to be open and labeled, is my point. If the companies are hurting artists (&#x27;s economic output), that should be examined and fixed (stopped and reattuned attention of said companies).<p>&#x27;trolling (bothering)&#x27; a company to be &#x27;good (not against human interests)&#x27; isn&#x27;t a bad thing.\n\n    Is it really so hard to imagine that someone might not like the idea of their work being used to train a machine to imitate their work with no compensation to them? And that machine is then instead used to benefit the shareholders of large corporations?<p>The position that this is a made-up issue when there are multiple large pending lawsuits about exactly this thing is pretty bizarre.\n\nOnce again we see that scaling laws are the way to better output.<p>This is why Sama said compute is the currency of the future.\n\n&gt; Total Nvidia H100 needed to support the creator community on TikTok &amp; YouTube: 10.7M &#x2F; 120 ≈ 89k<p>If the H100 is $40k worst case, that&#x27;s one-time cost of $356M! I could definitely see the FAANGs throwing money at this."

The security risks along with bad experiences with outdated and broken software in the past have convinced me to never use these features, which is a shame as people have probably made some neat themes and widgets. On the post, I don’t buy the comparison with AUR and PPA. Whatever the risks with those systems (and don’t get me wrong, they can be significant), the end user has usually concluded based on reputation from elsewhere that they want to install a particular application and they use the AUR or PPA system to get the job done. The theme stores on desktop environments, by contrast, seem like they’re going to be the way that users discover small pieces of content that are never going to have much of an external reputation. To use such programs safely you would have to read the source code of anything you’ve thinking about using, and not many people have the ability and time&#x2F;willingness to do so.\n\n  With the AUR and PPAs, random members of the community that weren&#x27;t involved with developing the original software can submit software. This means you can&#x27;t go off of the software&#x27;s reputation alone, as someone may have uploaded a malicious version of existing software (i.e. what happened around a month ago on the Ubuntu Snap store with a malicious Bitcoin wallet: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;popey.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;popey.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-sw...</a>).<p>I do agree that themes don&#x27;t sound like they could execute code, and KDE should be doing more to restrict what they can do to a user&#x27;s computer.\n\nIt bugs me that you seemingly can&#x27;t disable the KDE Store in Discover, because it&#x27;s not one of the &quot;repositories&quot;&#x2F;&quot;software sources&quot; listed in its settings. I wonder if this &quot;ghns&quot; kiosk flag is enough to completely turn it off.\n\n  I don&#x27;t know, but I avoid this problem by simply never using Discover. I don&#x27;t avoid it for any real reason other than it seems entirely unnecessary.\n\nCan somebody provide a code snippet that would be an example of something you definitely don&#x27;t want these addons to run? Or is it, like, any general C &#x2F; Python code?\n\n  I think the post that originated all this fuss was because something rimraffed the user&#x27;s whole root volume. IIRC a variable that wasn&#x27;t set so it nuked root instead of a specific dir.\n\n    Yikes, that&#x27;s still pretty stupid though, I&#x27;d check if after variable expansion I am getting `rm -rf &#x2F;`.<p>Thanks for context.

And if you ever listen into any committee meetings or try to present papers, ABI breaks are very serious concerns that can torpedo proposals.\n\n              Yeah.<p>Something doesn&#x27;t have to be enshrined into the standard to be a major driving point in the language.<p>The very existence of Carbon is due to the c++ committee not wanting to break abi compatibility.\n\n                Not only that many of the Carbon devs are former clang contributors, and one reason that clang is now on third place regarding ISO support, is that other devs had to step into what was previously contributed by Apple (now busy with Swift) and Google (busy with Carbon&#x2F;Rust).\n\n    Sadly, the C++ standard bodies are actually breaking old code in new versions of the language.<p>For example, C++&#x2F;11 introduced UTF8 string literals. Great feature which does what you’d expect – declare a string literal in source code, get a const pointer to null-terminated array of utf-8 bytes.<p>Then a decade later, in C++&#x2F;20 they refactored these UTF8 literals to evaluate into const pointers to the new incompatible data type, char8_t.<p>It’s so bad that compiler developers had to implement switches to disable the new BS. Unfortunately, these switches are incompatible across compilers, -fno-char8_t in gcc, &#x2F;Zc:char8_t- in msvc.\n\n    They address the problems of people that care enough to show at WG21 meetings, endure the multiple rewrites of their papers, and gather as many votes as they can.<p>As simple as that.<p>Many of the modern features aren&#x27;t even exposed to the comunity as preview features before being voted into the standard.\n\nBeautiful and well written article. Unfortunately I made a small mistake in the second quizz :P\n\n&gt; The matter is, none of the languages, especially the so-called “C++ killers” give any real advantage over C++ in the modern world.<p>To you. There are pleeenty of people who want to write performant code in a safe manner.\n\n  To anyone.<p>Take C++ vs. Rust, for instance.  If I look at this from a business perspective:<p>- Rust compiler can likely help confirm reference correctness, so this is a plus.\n- Rust language exchanges the cognitive load of memory allocation for tracking reference ownership, so this is a neutral.  (In C++ anything that has access to the pointer can technically &quot;own&quot; it so there is no need to track function call traces for ownership, but lifetimes do need to be analyzed against the semantics of the program.  Potato, po-tah-to.)\n- The pool of Rust developers available to work on a project is much smaller.<p>If I&#x27;m writing software where memory safety is of high importance and I can afford to take the risk with a smaller developer pool, Rust makes sense.  If I&#x27;m writing a game?  It&#x27;s going to make far more business sense to hire a bunch of C++ developers that can work with Unreal or C# developers to work with Unity or Python developers to work with Godot or whatever.<p>And for real mission-critical software memory allocation isn&#x27;t used so in those cases Rust has zero advantages.  (Real mission-critical software lays out a static memory map up front to avoid exactly the problems Rust is trying to avoid but to also ensure real-time &amp; predictable response times.)<p>So we&#x27;re left with niche software like OpenSSL or similar that can benefit from Rust.  But it&#x27;s more likely that we want a language that supports proofs of correctness (think Coq or seL4) in those cases and Rust can&#x27;t even support that.<p>So why choose Rust at all?\n\n&gt; None of these questions have a definite answer without context.<p>This is a pretty annoying thing to do considering someone took the time to read through all this.<p>Also not original, I’ve seen posts in here like this 3 times already\n\n&gt; But why can’t I just quit then? What’s the matter? The matter is, none of the languages, especially the so-called “C++ killers” give any real advantage over C++ in the modern world. All those new languages are mostly focused on holding a programmer on a leash for their own good.<p>This, very specifically, is the advantage these languages have over C++.<p>The benefit isn&#x27;t the universe of things you can do (they&#x27;re all Turing complete, you can do anything) - it&#x27;s what the language stops you from doing. This is the thing the C++ committee never understood or at the very least never appreciated.\n\n  why do you think the designers of those new languages know what is good for you?\n\n    Because they tell me to stop managing memory by hand, as we have mountains of experiment proof that no one[0] is good at it.<p>[0] I meant what I said.\n\n      um, modern c++  has for at least the past 10 years advised people not to manually manage memory.\n\n        not really, RAII&#x2F;shared_ptrs is still manual memory management, just less footguns\n\n          well, i would not recommend shared_ptr except under rare circumstances, but i don&#x27;t see what can be wrong with RAII. in fact, it is the languages thar don&#x27;t have RAII that have the problems, IMHO.\n\n          its the same as the tools rust provides you, so if that&#x27;s true it bodes poorly for the supposed c++ successor.\n\n    One thing I love about C++ is it (mostly) stops me making type errors, compared to dynamic languages - &quot;compile and it works&quot;. Adding type constraints makes programming safer, easier, and results in better compilation.<p>You can add other constraints (e.g. temporal constraints) and get similar benefits, on top of the above.\n\n      It also means you only get one third of the stuff done. Nothing &quot;compiles and it works&quot;. That just means you suck at finding bugs :p\n\n      Some dynamic languages do have type constraints these days, e.g. PHP.\n\n    Because I believe safety critical places like aviation are the ones that actually get things right. You can&#x27;t pile on every demand on the human in charge and expect improvement. We&#x27;re just not great at taking every possible detail into account. Doing lots of grunt work all the time reliably is what we have computers for.<p>In my old age, I find the more permissive a language is, the more painful it is to code in long term. Perl is great for simple things, but C++ was a vast improvement because it catches a lot of nonsense that Perl will compile just fine.<p>And debugging is so expensive that eventually writing code fast is near worthless. Whatever you gain you more than pay for in debugging afterwards.<p>C++ unfortunately doesn&#x27;t go far enough.\n\n      yes - i switched from C to C++ a long, long time ago (late 1980s) because C++ was so much more strongly typed (i still don&#x27;t understand why other C programmers have stuck with C). i&#x27;m less than convinced with the promises of rust (for e.g.), but have only written trivial programs in it.\n\n        Because simpler languages are inherently better than more complicated ones.\n\n          why? says who? assembler (about as simple as you can get) better than (for e.g.) C?\n\n            And even simpler is the iota combinator which is by itself turing complete.  So a single letter plus matching parens is about the simplest language as you can get.  But I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting or even being able to program in it.\n\n            Assembler is a bad example for simplicity. Perhaps brainfuck fits better in this case.\n\n            Simpler aka Python, Ruby, Basic, Pascal, not &quot;lower level&quot;.\n\n              i don&#x27;t see those languages as being &quot;simple&quot;. quick to program in, yes. but assembler is really pretty transparent, once you get into it. heck, i used to program in machine code (i don&#x27;t recommend it) without too many problems.\n\n              &quot;Simpler&quot; isn&#x27;t really a good adjective to classify languages. You have to be way more specific on what &quot;simple&quot; means. Are we talking characters needed to implement &#x27;hello world?&#x27; Time to first memory access segfault? Number of pages in the specification (which, at this point, I&#x27;m not sure whether Python or C++ wins out...)? Lines of code in the compiler &#x2F; interpreter?\n\n          Simpler languages often put more burden on the programmer.<p>There&#x27;s a balance.\n\n            Well no, what do you think the word simpler means?\n\n              C is a simple language.<p>Rust is not a simple language.<p>Lisp is also a simple language.<p>Lua is simple as well (well… maybe not…)<p>JavaScript is not.<p>C++ is not.\n\n                C isn&#x27;t a simple language, really, because it has a ton of implicit assumptions and inconsistencies, undefined behavior and all the failure modes you have to keep in your head at all times.<p>It&#x27;s not that C is simpler, it&#x27;s less expressive.<p>I don&#x27;t think this answers parents question though, which is what does it mean for a language to be simpler? I think that&#x27;s a good question. This is just a list of examples.<p>It almost seems like simple is a bad concept applied to languages because what&#x27;s simple and complex is the idea you&#x27;re trying to express, accurately, in its totality - not necessarily the language.\n\n                  I think expressiveness is complexity.<p>The fewer ways there are to express an idea, the simpler the language is.<p>Simple languages do not imply simple software (look at lisp)\n\n          Good luck programming your next application using the lamda calculus or a Turing machine.\n\n      One could actually have both.\nSpiral provides a lot of its performance by correctly specifying error constraints, which is a form of safety.\nYou could specify architectural constraints by hand too, for performance and portability.\n(With some good defaults.)<p>One could technically also get memory and reference safety this way. Which is the opposite of what Rust does for example, where it defaults to do a particular model of referencing memory and makes using any other painful.<p>It also does not have any constraints on timing or redundancy if necessary.<p>Automate some of this handling but still keep it explicit and you have a potential winner.\n\n    They don’t. What they do is create a system where the system protects itself from human error. They don’t know better than me: I agree with what they’re doing. Automatic enforcement of good things, plus an escape hatch for emergencies, is better than no restrictions ever.\n\n    I assume you program in assembly language, then? Can’t trust those structured programming types to know best how to manage your instruction pointer after all. “Functions”, “loops”, “conditionals”, all just fancy words for straitjackets.\n\n      I’d love a demographic study of folks who are really unhappy about languages like Rust and Go specifically because they believe they’re crushing their creative spirit. The “I need MAXIMAL EXPRESSIVENESS at all times! Don’t tell me how to do things!” sort<p>I hesitate to even guess what the findings would look like, but I bet it’d be interesting.\n\n        I agree the results would fascinating. The perception from the other side is that rustaceans crave to be bound in the constrictive swaddling of authoritarianism. Which seems to be born out in both the language itself and the foundation.\n\n          “the constrictive swaddling of authoritarianism” is a <i>wild</i> way to describe static analysis.\n\n            I&#x27;m pretty much static guarantees to the bone.  But I sort of get where the dynamic camp is coming from.  \nWith something like python, you need to understand lists, dictionaries, loops, and the call stack.  And then you&#x27;re off to the races.<p>Meanwhile with ocaml you need to understand type theory, type inference, algebraic data types, the module system, maybe row poly, (insert a bunch of other things), and now also algebraic effects.  And there&#x27;s no guarantee that the well formed logic of your domain problem is compatible with the type theory your language is using (although, adt + generics almost always does the job if you take a minute).<p>That being said, the way that&#x27;s being expressed here does leave something to be desired.  Like, if someone doesn&#x27;t jive well with static techniques that&#x27;s one thing.  But I&#x27;ve never really understood decrying people who get it as suffering from some sort of Stockholm syndrome.\n\n              I agree that there is a productive discussion to be had about all of these things, including their limits, for sure. Just that this way (my original parent, not you) isn’t it.\n\n                Yep, I think we&#x27;ve got the same position.<p>Even though I don&#x27;t agree with the dynamic camp, I like advocating for it because I think there are scenarios where there is something there.<p>However, the position that the static camp is somehow against freedom and morally wrong is pretty weird to me.\n\n        I mean, I don’t need maximum expressiveness, but imo languages with nearly over engineered type systems like rust, to me, lack almost any expressiveness without having to get into macros.\n\n      But when programming in assembly you&#x27;re still beholden to the CPU designers in regards to out of order execution and branch prediction and all those fancy layers taking runtime control away from you. Better to just print your own silicon.\n\n    Language implementers <i>ought to</i> know better than me (the user) about programming language semantics, in this case specifically things like memory safety.\n\n      Memory safety is a very small fraction of the problems a computer program can have, and replacing them by an immediate shutdown is hardly a very useful improvement on program quality.\n\n        &gt; Memory safety is a very small fraction of the problems a computer program can have<p>And a large fraction of the problems that lead to security situations. Worse, they are often so subtle that they stay in a codebase for decades.<p>&gt; and replacing them by an immediate shutdown is hardly a very useful improvement on program quality.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty absolutist statement about something that&#x27;s very context dependent.\n\n        &quot;Software quality&quot;, in my mind, includes &quot;nobody can send me a crafted text message that gives them remote root access on my phone.&quot;<p>Yes, there are security issues beyond memory safety bugs. But these are the issues that are most regularly turned into the most serious exploits and they are <i>hellishly</i> common.<p>All systems security is about layered defenses. &quot;Oh, log4j exists&quot; is not a compelling reason to avoid changes that can mitigate very large portions of security risk.<p>There are places where you&#x27;ll truly never encounter untrusted input and a crash is just as bad as blasting off and performing whatever unexpected computation, but that&#x27;s nowhere near the entire existing C++ landscape.\n\n          Design by contract improves software quality instead of lowering it.<p>And it explicitly introduces undefined behaviour aka &quot;memory safety bugs&quot;.\n\n            Design by contract? That technique which “shuts down your program”&#x2F;panics on assertion failure? You seem to contradict yourself.\n\n    This is a bit of a misnomer, languages don&#x27;t generally <i>stop</i> you from doing things. They just make really damn sure that you aren&#x27;t doing it by accident.\n\n    what do you think those new languages prevent you from doing?\n\n    Is a bounds check on every container access good for me? Not always. Sometimes my code is correct. But security vulnerabilities are observably a huge problem. And you only need one vuln in iMessage or whatever to get a dissident journalist&#x27;s phone hacked and then get them murdered by the Saudi government. Is &quot;I know what I&#x27;m doing, I promise&quot; good enough for you in that case?<p>I find it interesting because until about three years ago, C++ was always on the other side of this argument. We fight about static type systems. You could shout at the compiler that you know that your code is correct even though the type system doesn&#x27;t pass. Why does the committee think it knows better than me! Everything is just bits after all!<p>Now we are on the other side. C++ people saying &quot;bro I totally promise I&#x27;ll initialize this data member before it is used, stop making me initialize it in my constructor&quot;\n\n      &gt; Now we are on the other side. C++ people saying &quot;bro I totally promise I&#x27;ll initialize this data member before it is used, stop making me initialize it in my constructor&quot;<p>C++ has never said this - if a type has a constructor, that constructor will always be used in a data member (or elsewhere).\n\n        ???<p>You can absolutely write a type like this.<p><pre><code>    class Foo {\n     public:\n      Foo() {}  &#x2F;&#x2F; never initialized x\n      int x; \n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then using it like this<p><pre><code>    Foo f;\n    bar(foo.x);  &#x2F;&#x2F; oops\n</code></pre>\n&quot;But my types are well designed&quot; is the usual response to &quot;why the heck does the language allow you to quietly expose yourself to UB in this way?&quot;\n\n          zabzonk said &quot;if a type has a constructor&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think the int type does, which is why you get uninitialized memory here.<p>Any instance of Foo will run Foo&#x27;s constructor because Foo has one. The problem is that that instance of Foo won&#x27;t definitely have x initialized, because int doesn&#x27;t.\n\n            Sure. If for some reason you only care about this with regards to struct types that have constructors that correctly initialize all of their members then you are good by default (sort of, there are weird edge cases here with globals). But &quot;safe for this, not for that&quot; is not especially compelling to me when it is hard to imagine a C++ codebase that doesn&#x27;t use primitives&#x2F;pod types somewhere.<p>Plus, there are stl types that don&#x27;t guarantee initialization of members. So it isn&#x27;t like only ever resting on top of stl types is sufficient. std::optional has a non-default constructor but it can happily blow up because of a read of uninitialized data.<p>And the fact that this is the silent default behavior in C++ is <i>wild</i> to me. Even in languages where it is possible to leave data in an uninitialized state, you should need to loudly signal it.\n\n              <i>&gt; And the fact that this is the silent default behavior in C++ is wild to me.</i><p>I agree, totally. Backwards compatibility is a cruel mistress.\n\n          i said &quot;if a type has a constructor&quot;. but if you are fiddling around with ints and chars and the like, then you will need to initialise them. i have been writing c++ since the mid80s and have never found this to be a problem, or at least no more than it would be to use an uninitialised int variable in C.\n\n            The fact this is even a distinction anyone has to keep in mind is again an example of the problem. People are <i>awful</i> at remembering these weird little details. We shouldn&#x27;t expect people do things they&#x27;re bad at, all the time, and to get them right. And I&#x27;ll go a step further and say we shouldn&#x27;t <i>let</i> them by default. They should have to make it super explicit they want to opt into the weird behavior nobody expects.<p>You can do this in Rust if you want! You just have to use unsafe { mem::uninitialized() } or even better, the newer unsafe { mem::MaybeUninit::uninit() }<p>The whole point is that you <i>probably</i> don&#x27;t ever want to have an uninitialized variable you can access willy-nilly, and if you do, you should be very explicit.<p>Even your statement about C (and C++) isn&#x27;t quite accurate, right, because anything static is guaranteed to be initialized to zero on creation. So while `int x` is a free for all, `static int x` is gonna be zero. Another thing people shouldn&#x27;t have to think about!<p>Principle of least surprise.\n\n              i don&#x27;t actually use ints much in my c++ code. iterators for looping over things. using ints for accumulating is a problem in most languages.\n\n              I agree. I wish we had to say `int x = std::uninitialized;`\n\n            &quot;In some cases you are safe in other cases you aren&#x27;t&quot; is not good enough for real safety.<p>Congrats if you never write bugs. For the rest of us, we will use the widely available data that demonstrates that these bugs recur over and over and over and over even in organizations with strong developers, strong testing culture, and where the use of static analyzers and fuzzing is widespread.<p>Yes, C also has these problems. Both C and C++ represent significant safety risks, despite powering some of our absolute most security critical applications (the linux kernel and our web browsers). Other languages don&#x27;t give you these footguns.\n\n    This is such a silly send-up. They don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for me. They tell me what their language is good for. I decide if what the language is good for is good for me.\n\n      This is the key insight.  I think that the reason why we have so many c++ replacement languages is because c++ is okayish for basically anything.  Replacing it completely will necessitate several different languages that are good for different applications.<p>Okayish was fine or even necessary in the past but the industry has matured to the point where we need more purpose built tools for more specific projects.<p>Rust is going to be necessary but also zig, hylo, vale, p, Odin, and jai (assuming we ever get a release date).  A language able to do everything that c++ can is almost definitely only able to do it all okayish.\n\n    How could they know that?<p>They might know how to design a language such that it tends to produce exceptionally readable codebases, good performance, and improved safety, though. Maybe not all three at once, but some mix of those that’s better than existing languages, perhaps.\n\n    The same reason we all use structured programming instead of goto.\n\n  If Austin Powers was a programmer:<p>On a leash? What? ...  [if only I could work in a] consequence-free environment, I&#x27;ll be sound as a pound!\n\n  In other words, the “feature” those languages have is reducing the cognitive complexity and more tightly bounding the risk.<p>Newer languages are adding friction or dropping altogether things that you rarely or never want to do, to more tightly constrain the space of possible actions to the set of desired actions.\n\n    so experienced cc devs dont need it and the dream is mostly about creating experienced devs who write fast software damage limited by the guardrails of the environment? so its basically the c#\\java world of cheap oo software crawling over moores plateau hopping for one more silver bullet that will fix lowcost development,trying to solve the expensive  quality dev shortage once more by cheapening out.\n\n      Worst take you could have had on this.\n\n      Experienced c devs are people too.<p>People make mistakes.<p>We can make tools which reduce the frequency of certain classes of mistakes (c++ has a few of them now as well)<p>Those are pretty cool tools.\n\n  At least in aerospace we use C++ because we need a bare metal language and C++ is the most full featured&#x2F;widely used one. Rust is great but toolchain support just isn’t there yet and ADA&#x2F;Spark aren’t widely used anymore for new development.\n\nGreat article more about different approaches to building software that languages themselves.<p>My two cents: it is improbable that C++ will be ever replaced because it is a mastodon as a programming language: super complex, where complex includes complexity as difficulties and also its vastness. This doesn&#x27;t mean that it will increase its usage since it is common nowadays to use specific programming languages (e.g. Python) for specific purposes and rely on C++ and others for very specific areas. Personally, I really liked SWIG [1] as a wrapper and interface generator. Don&#x27;t know how much it is used today.<p>Other experience but similar conclusion than the article.\n\n  Is a language can be too big to fall? That&#x27;s an interesting question tbh.\n\n    Good question. My personal take is that C++ makes many developers happy, comfortable, and you can develop in C++ using different approaches, that is enough. There is no programming language for all and I think this is why we have a lot of them now and even DSLs.<p>I consider myself far from what is considered professional C++ knowledge, but for cryptography I always relied on Crypto++ [1] and that made me decide for the use of C++, at least partially. I think we can apply the same thinking for JavaScript or TypeScript, personally I don&#x27;t like too much those programming languages but if I need to write a RESTful backend I go that route because they have good modules for that or sometimes I decide for Python.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptopp.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptopp.com&#x2F;</a>\n\n  C++ is kind of a “language of last resort” type thing where you use it if there isn’t another good option for what you want to do. Eg. Most desktop development was done in C++, but now C# and newer languages have killed off C++ for most desktop apps. So C++ is still widely used in embedded&#x2F;performance critical use cases, but Rust will replace a lot of it over the long term.\n\n  New C++ projects are started every day. And billions of lines of C&#x2F;C++ runs the world. So C&#x2F;C++ will be around and used heavily for a very long time. Probably way beyond the retirement age of anybody reading this.\n\nLooks like the author is very focused on maximally optimizing some very compute-heavy signal-processing code, and doesn’t care much what is used outside of the compute kernel.<p>So it may be very true that for their work it’s all the same whether they use C++, or Python with numeric libraries, or some niche DSL, or a macroassembler.<p>But use of C++ is much broader than pure compute, so this perspective does not generalize to C++ or Rust as a whole.\n\n  But that is the thing, actually.<p>Little by little, domains where either C or C++ would be the option to go during the 1990&#x27;s, with exception of areas where VB and Object Pascal (Mac&#x2F;PC variants) were enjoying adoption, have been slowly taken away from them.<p>Bjarne created C with Classes for his distributed systems research at Bell Labs, nowadays the majority of CNCF project landscape is written into something else.<p>C++ GUI frameworks were all over the place during the 1990&#x27;s, nowadays one has to go to third parties, as platform vendors rather focus on managed languages. Even C++&#x2F;WinRT going into maintenaince is an acknowledgemnt from Microsoft that outside Redmond XAML &#x2F; C++ was a failure in regards to adoption.<p>Long term we might be left with LLVM, GCC, Unreal, Skia, CUDA, and a couple of other key projects that keep C++ relevant and that is about it.\n\n  Yeah if you define the utility of C++ so narrowly to these very highly micro-optimized use cases then Rust can easily capture 100x the mind share of C++ because programmers generally just don&#x27;t need to care that much. And really seeing what advanced Rust programmers can do when armed with godbolt I&#x27;m not convinced even those use cases demand using C++.\n\n&gt; Do you know that in MSVC uint16_t(50000) + uin16_t(50000) == -1794967296?<p>Not only is that insane code and both my compiler and static analysis go for my throat, it&#x27;s also not true. I think the argument is supposed to be about unsigned integer overflow, but the numbers don&#x27;t add up. The big negative number wraps to 63744.

When I was back, they were writing the whole game scenes in this interpreter so we had to support it for a while.<p>I very much want to hear that story\n\nOf course I know that uint16_t+uint16_t gives an int. If you&#x27;re gonna be programming in C or C++, you need to know these things.<p>And yes, I do agree the fact that I know so much minutiae about those languages is part of the reason why I&#x27;m reluctant to go for something else I have a more shallow knowledge of. But that level of attention to detail is also what allows me to deliver high-quality code that does exactly what I intend it to do.\n\n  &gt; If you&#x27;re gonna be programming in C or C++, you need to know these things.<p>You have to, not you need to. Of course I know plenty of them (so much that I have won IOCCC a decade ago), but most of them are just pure hindrances and do not contribute to anything positive.\n\nRelated discussion:<p>The C++ Killers (Not You, Rust) - Feb 2023 (59 comments) : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34792932\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34792932</a><p>It seems author has published the article last year but moved it to his blog now\n\n&gt; Just as Latin never actually died, just like COBOL, Algol 68, and Ada, – C++ is doomed to eternal half-existence between life and death.<p>I&#x27;m almost afraid to ask, but I&#x27;d love to know: are there any Algol 68 projects in active use? Anyone have war stories of maintaining them (bug fixes, new features, improvements to interface with more modern systems) in the last couple decades?\n\n  certainly not active, but back in the 1980s i got dumped on a program that used algol, bcpl, fortran and cobol to drive a phototypesetter to do ... something. this took advantage of the fact that the dec10 allowed you to mix &amp; match languages, much like the vax. i suppose i was lucky the idiot that originally wrote it didn&#x27;t throw lisp into the pot.<p>anyway, as i was hired as a microcomputer specialist, and as two dec10 systems programmers had ducked it, i simply said &quot;no can do&quot; - a valuable lesson.<p>this is what i like about HN - recalling things i had completely forgotten!\n\n  A company I used to work had an Algol system running until 2005.\nA rewrite had begun in the 1990s and went live in 2001 and the two systems were run side by side until to make sure the new system was correct.\n\n  Possibly. It was basically the native language of Unisys A-series mainframes and I guess those are still around in some form or other.\n\n    Ah makes sense - I believe the Algol system I mentioned in another comment was running on a Unisys mainframe.\n\nThe sine polynomial is bad because it&#x27;s not written in a way that removes redundant multiplications.<p>Those redundant multiplications cannot be removed without fast math because floating-point operations are not associative.<p>There are well-known optimal ways to evaluate a polynomial, namely Horner&#x27;s and Estrin&#x27;s schemes.\n\nNumba is great but missing explicit simd, stack allocated arrays, and user defined types, to name a few things. I tried to keep my colleagues in Jax these days.\n\n  It&#x27;s also a weird thing to bring up (Numba being great because it can jit-compile python to any arch, including GPUs) when the author discounted Julia... which has exactly the same property.\n\n    The difference is uptake. Julia&#x27;s good and it&#x27;s out there, but relative to the users of Python... How many people care how portable the Julia code they aren&#x27;t writing is? The existence of a tool to jit-compile Python is more useful to a lot more engineers than the existence of another language that is nicely jit-compileable.\n\n      Right, except the author also mentions two obscure languages with very little uptake at all, so it can&#x27;t simply be a popularity thing - they&#x27;re not useful at all, by that limited metric.\n\nNicely written.

That meant no ice hockey until he was cleared, but he was encouraged to do off ice drills.<p>Overall it didn&#x27;t seem too bad. He felt better and was cleared in about 2 weeks, with some lingering behavioral changes for about a month after that. And he didn&#x27;t feel great with some roller coasters we did at 4 months after.<p>But obviously, every concussion (or mild traumatic brain injury) is different.\n\n  Second concussions can be life altering, so we want to be absolutely sure our concussed friends and family are recovered before they do anything energetic.\n\n    The article presents that you might not recover without doing energetic things. But yeah, you&#x27;ve got to be careful ... and judgement and risk taking can be negatively affected, so you&#x27;ve got to be more careful than usual. Activities will be more risky than usual, but doing nothing isn&#x27;t good either.\n\n      No, that’s not what the article says.<p>If there is one thing developers can be relied upon to do, it’s this: if there is a Fallacy of the Excluded Middle, they will find it, fall into it, and then set up a household there. Just like the author did.<p><pre><code>   It’s one thing to avoid immediately going back onto a football field, where you might get hit again before you’ve recovered, or to work, which might be cognitively straining. But instead of *nuanced* advice that included downtime or a scaling back of activities, the recommendation became total rest.\n\n   A 2022 study published in the journal Pediatrics found that children who spent less than two hours a day on screens in the first week after a concussion had worse concussion symptoms after one month than did those who engaged in “moderate” screen time of two to seven hours a day.\n</code></pre>\nI don’t think anyone would call screen time energetic, by either the definition you guys are using, nor the one I was thinking, which was, “activities that can lead to injuries” which I’ll admit adds to the confusion.<p>“Not doing energetic things” includes many more options than hiding in your bed sleeping.\n\n        Wouldn&#x27;t this be an inverse cause and effect? It&#x27;s not that spending less time using a screen is detrimental, it&#x27;s that a worse brain injury causes people to need more rest?\n\n    Tfa says this is the exact wrong thing to do.\n\nTLDR; If you get a concussion, don&#x27;t do nothing and rest, but rather continue doing your daily routine. It&#x27;ll help you recover faster\n\n  except: 1) avoid the possibility of head injuries, and 2) if you suffer more than slight symptoms from daily routine, dial it back\n\n    While avoiding head injury is a good path to pursue, sometimes the head injury finds you.<p>It can take very little whiplash of the skull to cause a concussion.\n\n      Sure, but there&#x27;s only so much you can do to avoid such risks. We control the risks that we can control; the rest is up to luck.\n\n      Sure, it doesn&#x27;t take much. But most people&#x27;s active daily routines don&#x27;t result in frequent head trauma.\n\n        Or you can be walking safely outside and get hit by a car\n\n  Stay away from bonks and mind-straining activities, but do other things including light (aerobic, not anaerobic) exercise. Increasing toward your previous levels over time.<p>I would add to this: If you’re a clumsy person who trips on treadmills, maybe walking on a treadmill should not be in the cards for you.\n\n    Stay off the bicycle&#x2F;skateboard&#x2F;scooter eh. Take no chances - the worst case is very bad.\n\n  I had a pretty bad concussion when I was very young and I still remember how distorted my short term memory was right afterwards and to a lesser extent weeks after. Couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to be active nowadays under those circumstances.\n\nConcussions are mild traumatic brain injuries. There’s a lot more to recovering from a TBI than ‘rest’ or ‘stay active’.<p>Looked at the concussion alliance website - it seems to be quite reasonable. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.concussionalliance.org&#x2F;treatments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.concussionalliance.org&#x2F;treatments</a>\n\n  The subject of this article founded the concussion alliance website.<p>&gt;“It’s a huge myth,” Gormally told me. In 2018, after his experience, he and his mom founded Concussion Alliance, a nonprofit that is dedicated to patient and provider education. “It’s so pervasive; it’s actively damaging people’s recovery.” The idea that cocooning may be harmful is completely new information to most patients Gormally meets.\n\nI wish we had better diagnostic tools for concussion. In our ER, the majority of patients with potentially significant head injuries are moderately to highly intoxicated, provide minimal history, and even though we generally CT all impaired patients with head trauma and hold them until they are no longer intoxicated, in many cases it can be difficult to differentiate a significant hangover from a concussion.\n\n  There&#x27;s got to be some discoverable biomarker for it. If it&#x27;s significant enough to affect gross brain function, it&#x27;s got to have some effect on for example brain waste clearance, neurohormones, assorted growth factors, or produce some form of inflammatory markers.\n\n  It shouldn&#x27;t be that hard if you really hold them until they are no longer intoxicated. The last time I had a mTBI was actually in a hospital, luckily enough (passed out from standing up after traction). All the standard tests, i.e. follow this pen with your eyes, stand up straight and touch something, were things I continued not being able to do well for weeks. Alcohol impairment goes away after a few hours.<p>Granted, they obviously get more mild than that, but the milder they are, the less they matter as long as it isn&#x27;t happening repeatedly.\n\n    &gt; Alcohol impairment goes away after a few hours.<p>I think this is a gross oversimplification.<p>If memory serves, the rate of ethanol metabolism is something around 0.015 (units?) per hour.<p>In my ED, an average BAL for a patient that we realize is intoxicated (and choose to get a level) is probably 0.3 or so. 0.4 - 0.5 is common, and we see nearly 0.8 (in ambulatory patients!) from time to time.<p>So for 0.3, if you are maximally generous and consider &quot;sober&quot; 0.08 (the level for an automatic DUI in my state), you&#x27;re looking at <i>15 hours</i> of observation. Not exactly &quot;a few.&quot;<p>Further, your own anecdote highlights exactly my point. How you you *know* you had a TBI? Because it felt like one? Because a doctor told you it was one? Because a physician&#x27;s (subjective) assessment of your exam suggested it was one? Because your insurance would cover an inpatient stay for one if they listed that as the diagnosis?<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand, I do a relatively thorough neurological exam compared to my colleagues, but I have no pretenses as to the level of subjectivity in my assessment, or to the external biases that could potentially sway my judgment. A more objective measure would be greatly appreciated, both to help ensure that I was acting in patients&#x27; best interest, and frankly to help me compel others to act in appropriate cases.\n\nRed light therapy is a good tool to add to whatever protocol your doctor gives you.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vielight.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;traumatic-brain-injury&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vielight.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;traumatic-brain-injury&#x2F;</a>\n\nI&#x27;m stoked to see an article shedding some light on this! Yes, the best practices for how we treat concussions is shifting and some people are not getting the best advice post-concussion.<p>The discussion about who to blame is a little naive IMO. Doctors do not learn everything they need to know to be doctors in medical school. Largely, they learn the foundations of medicine that they need to be successful in a residency. In residency is where they will learn the things they need to know about how to treat patients in their specialty. The authors primary care physician was very likely taught about concussions in residency, before these new guidelines came out, and simply has not updated their practice to be in line with the new guidelines... Science changes and I&#x27;m sure it is hard to stay on top of each new thing that comes out but at the end of the day, that is the job of the physician to stay on top of new developments.\n\n&gt; You’d think that this would have meant a revolution in how doctors understand and treat concussions. It hasn’t.<p>The article takes a surprised tone that doctors haven’t updated their practices in line with the latest studies, but that’s not usually how doctors work. Doctors aren’t intrinsically academics, and aren’t necessarily hooked into the scientific literature. Doctors don’t get their orders direct from science, they follow the practices of their peers and network. New knowledge percolates slowly and conservatively through that network.\n\n  &gt; The article takes a surprised tone that doctors haven’t updated their practices in line with the latest studies<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;new research&quot; or the &quot;latest study&quot;, this is now established scientific consensus.<p>&gt; Doctors don’t get their orders direct from science, they follow the practices of their peers and network. New knowledge percolates slowly and conservatively through that network.<p>This is indeed part of the problem.<p>Doctors should get knowledge of new practices from medical school or CME, not haphazardly through gossip. As noted in the article, medical scools don&#x27;t teach very much about concussions and clearly our new understanding of concussion treatments are not being dispersed with sufficient speed by CME.<p>We need to hold our medical system to higher standards, not give them a pass because the broken parts have been broken for a while.\n\n  It typically takes at least 30 years from a finding to becoming medicine. First it needs to reach sufficient consensus that it starts getting taught in medical school once that happens it then takes 10 years to become common place for it to be taught and then 10-20 for those students to become consultants and be in the position to dictate how a treatment is applied. Sometimes some findings can take a long time to get into textbooks or the textbooks on a topic to get updated and the initial stages take longer. But 30 years is about the best medicine can currently achieve in any volume.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily know if such consensus has been reached for return to normal with concussions, psychology and exercise researchers are trying to make Cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise and a general appeal to nature as the solution to everything in medicine at the moment and there is a lot of bad studies with low or very low quality results on that basis. I haven&#x27;t followed concussion research so I don&#x27;t know if that is what is happening here but I suspect its likely. I would just be aware that a lot of the replication crisis with medical research is due to this effect so you have to look at the studies and be aware of the alternatives.\n\n  Wait, is Continuing Professional Development not mandatory for medics in your country? That&#x27;s crazy. Like, that&#x27;s so obviously necessary there was a <i>Scrubs</i> episode about it.<p>You definitely shouldn&#x27;t have medics who are relying on long obsolete practices and just incrementally learning via the grapevine, get some regulations. It&#x27;s bad enough that so many countries don&#x27;t require CPD for software engineering. I don&#x27;t care that you&#x27;ve been copying the source code into a dated folder every day since 1987, it&#x27;s 2024 and you need an actual Revision Control System.\n\n    The doctors I know go to conferences all the time, so I&#x27;m not sure this is 100% accurate. Many also read medical publication journals.\n\n<i>How did we get concussions so wrong in the first place? And how many patients were still being told the wrong thing?</i><p>no, the better question is why do we putting ourselves or encouraging our children to put themselves in situations where they get concussions? Does not seem worth it.\n\n  Like climbing a tree?  Childhood is all about risky exploration.<p>Youth sports are something else - the risks and the potential damage have been amplified mightily by attempting to emulate professional sports practices.  So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting at, absolutely.\n\nI mentioned in another comment this has happened to me before. Actually, at least three times I remember, twice when I was a kid and then once a bit over a decade ago. The &quot;we&quot; here is overstated. This kid received advice from an athletic trainer at his high school and a general practice PCP. You really need to be seeing a specialist in brain injuries. The last time I got a mTBI, it was actually reasonably bad and I could not even stand up without disorientation for nearly a month, but the treatment was absolutely not &quot;go home and a rest.&quot; This happened while I was still in the Army, so sure, you can expect a specialized TBI clinic for presumably the employer second-most likely to results in TBIs behind the American NFL is going to know what they&#x27;re doing better than a family practice dude who finished med school 30 years ago, can&#x27;t possibly read the latest research from every possible sub-specialty, and mostly puts bandaids on and takes your blood pressure.<p>Such is the state of healthcare, though. Physicians are not wizards. You can&#x27;t expect one person to know everything. The PCP probably should have referred him to a specialist, but barring that, you need to insist on seeing one yourself. Unfortunately, a kid isn&#x27;t going to know that, so parents, please do the same for your kids.<p>As for the actual protocol I went through, it was retest weekly, continue going to work and running and what not, but don&#x27;t play any sports, avoid the motorpool, light duty in the office instead, and I was barred from driving until I could pass all the tests, which took four weeks.\n\nI got smoked in the temple by a knee during jiu jitsu.  I felt immediate pain that immediately subsided.  No sypmtoms, so I kept rolling.  When I got home, I realized that was pretty stupid and I started remembering hearing about people dying from minor blows to the temple. I stayed up late to make sure I was ok but still no headache or any symptoms. After several days of no symptoms, I eventually got a mild tension like headache that lasted for 3 weeks and felt generally run down, like I had just woken up all the time. And then I was fine. Long story short, head injuries are bizarre.\n\n  If you weren&#x27;t ok you would black out so really best to get checked at a hospital.\n\nI can hear my father saying &quot;walk it off&quot;...<p>The old man wasn&#x27;t too far off the mark after all.\n\n  The one thing you should absolutely <i>not</i> do is engage in anything that can give you another concussion. A second concussion before recovering from the first can kill you. So no, he was not anywhere close to the mark.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second-impact_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second-impact_syndrome</a>\n\n&gt; Gormally was finally well enough to go back to school—and ready to put the whole experience behind him. But he kept getting concussions. Three more times over the next three years, he hit his head playing sports: twice in soccer, and once during Ultimate Frisbee. With each concussion, he received the same spiel from medical providers: “There’s not much we can do for you.” “Go home and rest.” “These things tend to get better on their own.” Each time, it didn’t feel as if they did.<p>Two things it feels like we&#x27;ve started to forget as a society: doctors aren&#x27;t gods, they are fallible, they don&#x27;t have the answer to everything; and you aren&#x27;t immortal, you are also fallible, vulnerable.<p>Synthesizing those two things, and the quote: you need to take responsibility for your own health. There&#x27;s people who do that; and then there&#x27;s people who take months to recover from a concussion, and upon barely recovering immediately go back to playing hard contact sports, twice, and then get interviewed for a magazine piece about how wrong doctors are.\n\nA small sample of things we&#x27;re doing all wrong, according to Slate:<p>* Measuring the economy<p>* Thinking about the long tail theory<p>* Giving kids allowance<p>* Understanding teen happiness<p>* Making risotto<p>* Talking about the movie <i>Tár</i><p>* Making movies about Malthusian population explosions<p>* Thinking about herd immunity<p>* Legalizing marijuana<p>* Estimating the age of menopause<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;search?q=all+wrong#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=all%20wrong&amp;gsc.page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;search?q=all+wrong#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=all%20w...</a><p>That&#x27;s from the first two pages, there are at least ten.\n\n  Coming up soon: Taking media bait seriously ...\n\n  As a country we definitely need to attack the risotto issue.\n\n    Gordon Ramsay would definitely agree with this.\n\n      We are a nation of idiot sandwiches.\n\n  We&#x27;ve been doing it all wrong, wrong.\n\n  imo, I think we&#x27;ve been publishing all wrong. We should publish more of things done correctly to inspire by example rather than whining about everything that is wrong in this world for a hundred pages.\n\n  We&#x27;ve been reading Slate all wrong. Perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t.\n\nI had a severe concussion 18 weeks before finals my 3rd year of college. Crashed hard mountain biking, broke my arm, and smashed my face. For 8 hours I was a broken record so the first hospital I visited sent me off to a trauma center in the next city over. I came out of that concussed state after they were asking me questions I should know the answer to, but couldn’t remember them for the life of me. I remember it feeling like my neurons couldn’t grab ahold of any connection. Funny enough, the two things I could remember was the speed of light and the Bohr’s magneton. After I said those two constants out loud, everything came back. To this day it was the most surreal feeling I’ve experienced.<p>That accident happened on a Saturday, and I didn’t sleep at all the next day for fear of going into a coma. I went to school and work on Monday, and managed to finish the semester without any issues.<p>I know I’m extremely lucky, but I think the fact that I went back to life as if nothing happened was what helped me recover so quickly. I still can recite 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s as the speed of light and 5.788e-5 eV&#x2F;T as if it’s the most hard wired connection in my brain.\n\n  That isn&#x27;t the speed of light.\n\n    This is the most terrifying exchange I&#x27;ve read on HN in a while\n\n      The smack to the head sent him into a parallel dimension with a different speed of light and he&#x27;s just now finding out.\n\n    Probably meant to type km&#x2F;s\n\n      Just the wrong number, at least for light in a vacuum. 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s is the correct value.\n\n    Harsh.  Considering that most of us remember it as 3x10^8 m&#x2F;s I was willing to roll with it.<p>Apparently he is a little off. 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s according to Wikipedia<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speed_of_light\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speed_of_light</a>\n\n      Right, and that&#x27;s a definition. Modern SI works by <i>defining</i> constants, so then when scientists figure out a way to measure more exactly they&#x27;re actually refining our understanding of the SI units, the numbers (such as the speed of light in metres per second) never change any more, so that&#x27;s convenient.\n\n    It is in a material with a refractive index of 1.001122387 ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯\n\n    To anyone reading this now and thinking, “299,792,458 m&#x2F;s <i>is</i> the speed of light!”: stairlane’s comment originally  gave 299,456,352 m&#x2F;s as the speed of light. Unfortunately they’ve since edited it to the correct value, thus ruining a very good exchange\n\n  I don&#x27;t have any concussions as far as I know, but my brain feels like this sometimes. I wake up and it just feels empty, there&#x27;s very minimal internal monologue and it feels hard to recall anything of note. I&#x27;ve taken to loading up a bunch of Jeopardy questions into Anki and then doing 50 or 100 random questions over a period of a few minutes, and that seems to get my brain turned on and the inner monologue comes back, and I can recall things. I&#x27;d love to know why this happens.\n\n  I have a surprisingly similar anecdote! Face-planted skating during finals week in my first year at university. My first memories are some hours later in the waiting room at a hospital that my friends had brought me to, holding a notepad with some hand-written responses to &quot;What happened?&quot; and &quot;Where am I?&quot; because my friends had gotten tired of repeating answers to the questions I&#x27;d forget having asked every few minutes.<p>I only had a couple finals remaining, and my profs gave me deferrals as soon as they saw the state of my face when I showed up at their offices. Wrote them a week or two later without issue.<p>Didn&#x27;t notice any lingering mental issues, though it&#x27;s now been nearly two decades and a nerve in my face still feels a bit funny, and my current dentist pointed out that it seems like I&#x27;ve done some damage to some of my jaw tendons at some point. (But as it doesn&#x27;t cause me problems, didn&#x27;t recommend treatment.)\n\nI have been a part of MMA&#x2F;Boxing in some way or another close to my entire adult life, and it has always been shocking how badly we treat concussions or blows to the head.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Olympic hopefuls being KNOCKED out and given the okay to compete by doctors. The macho attitude doesn&#x27;t help. One personal anecdote I&#x27;ve seen, time and time again, that has helped is oxygen post-knockout.<p>every person I&#x27;ve spoken to who has gotten oxygen after a knockout or a hard match told me that they felt much much better vs the times they haven&#x27;t. Not sure why or how.\n\nScotty from the Strange Parts YouTube channel (fantastic) got a very serious concussion that he struggled to recover from for a long time. He made a few videos about it, and has more on his second channel regarding the interesting treatment he did (e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mrNKhgAiR7E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mrNKhgAiR7E</a>). I don&#x27;t know anything about this stuff so they could be legit or snake oil, but what they do does seem to align with the premise of the article."

Lots of cool new toys to play with lately.\n\n      AI is NOT a toy it is an Abomination.\n\n        I haven&#x27;t had this much fun programming since I was a kid. The speed with which I&#x27;m able to pick up new concepts and execute my toy ideas and experiments is just crazy. The last year has been an absolute joy being able to cut through debugging new things and jump over brick walls.<p>It&#x27;s not going anywhere and is only going to get better, learn to leverage it.\n\n          Are you actually learning the concepts though? I&#x27;m not trying to be inflammatory but a lot of people I see using LLM use them as a replacement for StackOverFlow. They aren&#x27;t learning anything they just need it to spit out code that works.\n\n            Do you need to really learn if it works and ships?\n\n              This isn&#x27;t a commentary on AI, but specifically the idea that all you need to achieve is &quot;it works&quot;. That&#x27;s based on the fallacious premise that a human can reasonably bucket a program (especially one as complex as an end-user application) into &quot;working&quot; and &quot;not working&quot;. You don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s &quot;not working&quot; until you know, which may in some cases be never.<p>As for AI specifically, robust testing is already difficult with human-curated logic. It&#x27;s potentially more likely to miss failing cases, or non-binaries (e.g. performance, security), when testing genAI. More subjectively, your conjecture represents a mindset that is demotivating to people with certain flavors of creativity&#x2F;passion. Also, overreliance on AI may blunt skills that may remain useful, and even important - i.e. it may exacerbate an expertise scarcity.<p>(this may make me sound more negative on AI that I am - remember that I&#x27;m commenting in the context of the post you&#x27;re replying to)\n\n            Yes, absolutely. AI has been an amazing learning tool for me as I transitioned into gamedev working at a Unity studio. What used to take upwards of hours to research or debug can now be solved in minutes by asking AI about solutions, best practices, and feedback on code.<p>I am constantly using AI to learn more every day -- and learning at a faster rate than I was just pouring through the internet for those same answers.\n\n            Absolutely, and I get the sentiment.<p>I&#x27;m not just using it to generate code, but asking specific questions. Even really basic stuff like, write me a Fibonacci number generator in X language. Helps me understand the syntax immediately. I can start from a place of familiarity. A lot of times when picking up a new language, the hello world stuff is kind of drawn out. Give me a program in Rust that generates 50 random numbers and sort it from smallest to biggest. Give me the basic framework for a Flask app, etc etc.<p>Or, I have an app that scrapes a website. What is the best architecture to put this into a database to reduce scraping the same thing multiple times?<p>I use it like a project manager&#x2F;software architect&#x2F;tutor in that order I think.<p>It massively reduces the friction to just getting things going.\n\n          I know how to leverage it, I’m just eye-rollingly tired absolute bottom-barrel quality AI images, and AI generated content. Every time I see AI generated content, including header images and logos, it’s become a marker for “too lazy to put in effort, so why should I”.<p>I bought a midjourney subscription for a while, and had fun playing with it, for like, 2 weeks and then that was kind of it? Like, yep, you give it some text, you get some image. Ok. None of it brings me joy like actual art or photography does.\n\n            No snark intended but I think image generation is probably the least interesting thing AI is doing these days. It&#x27;s a tutor in a box.\n\n          AutoComplete and Machine Learning are tools.<p>They are not the same as the Abomination parading as Intelligence called &quot;AGI&quot;.\n\n            I really struggle to know what to say to people with this attitude other than &quot;Ok, well, we will keep progressing while you pout about it. Come back when you&#x27;re ready to be a big boy.&quot;<p>Who gives a shit about the terminology? It&#x27;s crazy useful. Would you be happier if everyone called it &quot;Poopy Dumb AI&quot;? I doubt it.<p>Idk if it&#x27;s just ludditism, or fear of replacement, or jealousy or what, but I just can&#x27;t understand it.\n\n      Yeah, I actually forked the list to go through each site later and check most of them out. It honestly seems like a great way to discover new AI tools&#x2F;websites since it looks like it&#x27;ll be easy to spot the low-quality sites among the sea of actually-interesting&#x2F;helpful ones blocked for no reason.\n\n      Obviously it is a list of AI sources that may be interesting - but I didn&#x27;t contest that. I object to snark. Not to whether a person has an overall positive or negative view on AI.<p>Declining to be snarky often helps out everybody, and obviates the motivation to jump to defensiveness.\n\n  The sites are actually interesting\n\nwas excited for a second thinking this was a way to use ai in real time to block elements on a page based on user defined criteria\n\n  I was thinking the same thing when I read it.<p>That honestly sounds like a fantastic use of AI that doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone.\n\n  Honest question - why something like that doesn&#x27;t exist yet?\n\n    Because detecting AI content is not yet a solved problem. And it might never be, because such a thing would be wonderful to train against while making the next big AI.\n\n      The question directly above is about using AI as to enhance the content-blocking technology, not about using blocking technology to target AI content.\n\n    There&#x27;s no performant way to do so, even with browser-friendly model optimizations.\n\n    It probably exists, but not very well known, or is too expensive to use.  For example, I wrote a SpamAssassin extension that adds some score to messages based on whether LLM thinks it is a spam email.  It worsk very well, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey when it comes to API costs. Maybe if I switch it from GPT3.5 to Claude Haiku it will make more sense.<p>I think we still need to see prices of LLM tokens go significantly down and performance increase before such web filtering solutions make sense. The Claude Haiku is a big step int he right direction, but the price is still high for this kind of high-volume usage.\n\nYeah, way too broad and uninformed. Seems to indiscriminately block anything `.ai` and on a quick read I immediately noticed deeplearning.ai (Andrew Ng&#x27;s super famous course) is on the list.\n\nI was inspecting the list and I thought it was kinda funny that there are a few absolutely random URLs to single AI images like: artstation.com&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;KOJ80W, it doesn&#x27;t even have a like, I wonder why it was worth blocking that one in particular.\n\nIs this just against AI-generated content in general, or against sites that use AI-generated content and do not disclose that they are doing so?\n\n  I&#x27;d say more &quot;AI in general&quot; (especially when you get to the nuclear list and it just walls off DeviantArt).\n\n  It appears to just be anti-ai without any discernment whatsoever.\n\nThis list kind of seems to miss the mark... I want to block sites that use bad ChatGPT content to do SEO drowning out real content or otherwise uses AI in an abusive way. I wouldn&#x27;t want to block sites that just talk about AI, or are AI demos (where nobody is being tricked or spammed).\n\n  Ironically, the only way to catch that stuff at scale or in an automated fashion, is with AI.\n\n  Yeah, there are actually so many useful sites being blocked if you actually look at the list. Artbreeder is a great example.<p>Other examples of useful sites on the list: Huggingface, Civit.ai, DeviantArt, PromptHero, AIDungeon, Midjourney, Stability.ai&#x27;s company website, and even Canva.<p>This just seems like a list for the &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see anything about AI ever&quot; mindset, rather than, as you said, a list for directly fighting the misuse of AI.\n\n    To be fair, every AI community that allegedly attempts to exclude the latter ends up failing badly, so the former is really the only option.<p>I trust no claims of &quot;actually useful AI&quot; after being burned so many times.\n\n      I don&#x27;t care whether its useful so much as if they are being  annoying&#x2F;misleading about it.<p>Take for example <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisanimedoesnotexist.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisanimedoesnotexist.ai&#x2F;</a>  (chosen randomly from the list). Is it useful? No (or at least not to me. I suppose there probably exists some audience for this sort of thing). However its not pretending to be something its not, so its also not problematic. Nobody goes to that website thinking they are getting hand drawn anime only to be baited &amp; switched.\n\n    most people want to never hear about AI again, it&#x27;s everywhere in their face all of the time. Technologists and grifters are so dominant in the field and have zero ethics, people just don&#x27;t want to deal with anything adjacent.\n\n      I&#x27;m not sure about &quot;most&quot; people (I think most people are just now learning that e.g. ChatGPT &amp; Windows Copilot even exist), but those people who don&#x27;t want to see anything about AI ever absolutely do exist and this list is probably great for them -- and it&#x27;s also great for all those communities in which those same people would probably be distracting or otherwise cause problems in. Seems like a win-win list to have.\n\n        Meh, ChatGPT has had plenty of news coverage and people were talking a lot about it. Traditional news are filled with stories about AI this and AI that. Even stuff that isn&#x27;t AI now includes AI somehow just to jump on the hype train.<p>I&#x27;ve got a normie friend who&#x27;s already in full doomsday mode about AI and quoting stupid stuff people in the news say about &quot;this wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without AI&quot; and we&#x27;re all losing our jobs. People talked about AI a lot and the topic has become boring.<p>Plus what GP said about grifters and people with zero ethics. I wouldn&#x27;t mind blending out most of the AI news except maybe actual research progress (and I don&#x27;t mean better LLMs). It&#x27;s just a buzzword that I&#x27;ve come to associate with low quality by now. Every stupid thing is with AI now, every Launch HN is something with AI. I&#x27;m personally bored by this\n\nAt first I assumed this would finally blocked auto-generated garbage SEO spam results. But it seems to just list a bunch of AI art generators and other pretty useful content.<p>This seems more like a whitelist tbh.\n\nBlocking any .ai domain seems completely off the mark. I thought this would be sites which have obviously AI generated content.\n\n  These are a bunch of neo-Luddites. AI is just a tool, and isn&#x27;t much different than photoshop. They&#x27;re afraid of applied mathematics.<p>From their blocklist source:<p>&gt; Going NUCLEAR!!! (sites that have a lot of AI &quot;art&quot;&#x2F;heavily support AI &quot;art&quot;, but also have some authentic artwork;)<p>This is so ignorant of how these tools are actually being employed.<p>I&#x27;m actually fine with them removing themselves from the community. The fewer complaints we&#x27;ll hear.<p>This, however (also from their blocklist source), is concerning:<p>&gt; Gross nudify sites&#x2F;deepfakes&#x2F;porn (why isn&#x27;t this illegal?!?!)<p>While I think generating porn of people is weird and potentially abusive, these people seeking to constrain thought and free speech are outright <i>scary</i>. Far scarier than any imagined breasts or penises.<p>Imagine how far down that slippery slope we&#x27;ll slide if these people start to have their way.<p>Where were these people complaining about Beeple&#x27;s Trump nudes? (I&#x27;m not trying to be political - I&#x27;m just stating that all of a sudden AI has people wanting to constrain free speech.)<p>The media narrative of &quot;AI scary&quot; is winning, and the politicians can and will use that to control us more.\n\nWill some of these rules have false-positives that HNers won&#x27;t want hidden from them in search results?<p><pre><code>    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;Stable Diffusion&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;AI Art&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;Generative AI&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;Ai&#x2F;):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;AI&#x2F;):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;Lora Model&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;diffusion&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;midjourney&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;niji&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;SDXL&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;ai generated&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;text image synthesis&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;aiart&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n    google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;AI illustration&#x2F;i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)\n</code></pre>\nAlso, for true-positives for these rules, you might want <i>not</i> to hide them, since showing them can make a user aware of a site that needs a domain-based rule contributed to the ruleset.\n\nWhat if some AI generated content is...good?\n\n  .... its not.\n\n    I have a few blogs where I post useful content with human written articles, but the images are AI generated. They make the article better and add visual context without me having to pay graphic designers for stuff i&#x27;ll never make money on.\n\nI&#x27;m really, really struggling to put myself in the frame of mind of a person who feels they need uBlock to block &#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning.\n\n  This for sure feels like a rage block list. Some guy just starts sweating every time he sees something AI related. BLOCKED!! <i>fumes</i>\n\n  I can understand an artist that works for commission to draw a nice pidgeon searching for pidgeons on the net to use for reference. And then ends up sending a picture of something an AI thinks is a pidgeon but has horse eyes :-)\n\nI wish there was a list lihe this to block AI-generated spam that wasn&#x27;t evangelism against anything AI-related. This blocks a bunch of discussion subreddits for no real reason.\n\nWhat about blocking chatgpt crawlers?! \nThe other day I was asking ChatGPT about specific topic, it did answer me first with a generic answer, two out of the three citations were my personal website..\n\nThanks for a list of interesting websites!\n\n&gt; google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div&gt;a:has-text(&#x2F;AI&#x2F;):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)<p>this has to be a joke right?\n\nI see the utility of this as removing AI image results from google images. Many artists need to search for real life photo reference in order to improve their drawing or painting skill. If you&#x27;ve never heard &quot;photo reference&quot; before, you may assume this is like tracing, but that is not the case. What you do is &quot;study&quot; a reference then paint on your canvas separately. This is to improve your ability to render particular subjects and materials.<p>Although AI generated art is fairly adept at rendering materials at the small scale, they often have issues of large scale consistency (e.g. clothing wrinkles turning into seams in an unrealistic way) or being inaccurate (e.g. a certain type of wild cat having ear tufts when it shouldn&#x27;t). These are real examples that I have seen.<p>Needing to sift through AI art in order to find true photographs for reference is frustrating. A blocklist helps with that.\n\n  What did people do before Google Image search and the Internet existed? Let&#x27;s block everything because a few entitled hobbyists no longer have a world revolving around them.\n\n    I assume you&#x27;d go to the library and find photo catalogues, but this is inconvenient and before my time. Nobody is suggesting everyone use this blocklist, but it&#x27;s here for the hobbyists who want to use it.\n\nWhat did Anguilla ever do to you?<p>For all the trash-talk about .ai domains, it&#x27;s disappointing that the authors fail to clarify that .ai doesn&#x27;t necessarily stand for &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;.\n\nInteresting note: ChatGPT (openai.com) is _not_ blocked in this list, although &#x2F;r&#x2F;OpenAI and &#x2F;r&#x2F;ChatGPT are."

      "conversation_text": "Lenovo announced new ThinkPads with &quot;better sustainability and extended repairabilty&#x27;. The Intel variants are the L14 i Gen5, L16 i Gen1, L13 2-in-1 Gen 5, X13 Gen 5 and X13 2-in-1 Gen 5. AMD variants of the L14 Gen 5 and L16 Gen 1 have also been announced (but with sadly no TB4, but USB-4 only). The press release further reads that &quot;One of the key features of the new ThinkPad L14 Gen 5 and L16 Gen 1 is enhanced repairability, with support from iFixit who have delivered a preliminary score of 9 out of 10.&quot;.\n\nDo I want one? I sure do. Can I justify it? I can not.<p>I want to like linux desktop, I do. But Linux desktop feels more like it&#x27;s part of the project and less like a tool.\n\nDo they solder the USB-C connectors on the motherboard still? Because that has been actually the only fatality in the T470&#x2F;T495&#x2F;T14 machines I have. There is no way of effectively repairing the connector other than throwing the motherboard away as the connector shell usually rips up traces when it goes.<p>Apple put theirs on a replaceable daughter board, which while annoying to get out, is possible with minimal tools. I’d expect the same if iFixit are crowing on this.<p>Edit: did some googling and found out that no they haven’t fixed this flaw. The USB-C ports are still directly soldered to the motherboard. More landfill and completely compromises this marketing. And it makes a mockery of iFixit supposed 9&#x2F;10 score.<p>Source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Document&#x2F;sunTY6dbbJvOMRjP&#x2F;Repairability-Snapshot-%E2%80%93-Lenovo-ThinkPad-T14-Gen-5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Document&#x2F;sunTY6dbbJvOMRjP&#x2F;Repairabili...</a>\n\n  Are there often problems with these connectors?<p>Asking because I bought a &quot;broken&quot; thinkpad very cheap and the only thing that doesn&#x27;t work is the USB ports that occasionally stop working.\n\n    Yes very regularly. Also on Dell machines from experience. Yubikey wore out both USB-C ports on a dell 5550 in under a year.\n\n      Is it USB-C fault in general or a peculiarity of the Dell? I&#x27;d be rather pissed if that happened to any laptop and wonder what the precautions should be.\n\n        I think it&#x27;s a bit of both. The USB-C connector design isn&#x27;t great. And some vendors have worse connector shells then others. Dell and Lenovo seem to have terrible ones. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with Apple USB-C connectors or anything on Anker or Google Pixel devices.<p>I really wish they did design USB-C in a way like lightning. It was very difficult to screw up a lightning port unless you were really determined. At most the connector blade would snap off in the device thus breaking the cheap end of the connector, not the expensive end.\n\n          Thanks, feeling slightly better.<p>Actually I really don&#x27;t like lightning cables but thinking about it now what I actually don&#x27;t like is how the cables themselves break. I had only slight issues with lint in ports which I needed to pick out with a toothpick, never had a connector snap off or anything like that, but the cables failed all the time regardless.<p>Maybe if Apple weren&#x27;t so stubborn about cable thinness we&#x27;d be in a different place right now.\n\n            The cables were crap yes I agree there. But case in point my mother has my 2015 phone 6s. It’s been through me and two of my kids already. We are all violent simian creatures who spend a lot of time doing silly things outdoors. But the port is still fine. I don’t think this will be the case for my iPhone 15 with USB-C\n\n      &gt; Also on Dell machines from experience.<p>Yup, current personal laptop: had to send it back for a motherboard change due to the USB-C not charging anything. One year later almost the same problem but this time one of the port is still working.<p>Work latptop: exact same problem. USB port dead which necessitated a motherboard change.<p>Dell makes really poor quality laptops nowadays.\n\n    I don&#x27;t know your particular model or situation and what the root cause would even be, but I have had issues with the USB ports that were later fixed in firmware, or one port that would stop working after a BIOS update until I disconnect the battery and wait a few minutes. Others on the Lenovo forums have identical&#x2F;similar issues and resolutions.<p>I also had a functional laptop where they switched out the mainboard due to USB connector issues (which never showed up in BIOS tests).<p>Lenovo&#x27;s approach to USB is a mystery.\n\n  Ifixit focuses on some weird criteria. Like pentalobe screws are annoying but not a real impediment to repair. Soldered NAND is a wear item and a WAY bigger deal.\n\n    iFixit are a business. They are driven on attention and sales. Not facts. Although some of the time they overlap.\n\n      I&#x27;m not going to denigrate them for being a business. They&#x27;ve done more for repairability and sustainability than most.<p>Repairability is a process not a factual end state, there are tradeoffs in design.\n\n        I will because their own products aren’t particularly good and their assessment of repairability on some products, as evidenced here, is likely biased by business relations.<p>I do a lot of repair work (ex EE &#x2F; production engineer) and I’ve been shot by poor parts and tools from them. I look elsewhere first.\n\n          What I believe you are referring to is that most of the ifixit branded parts are white label with commensurate quality. This is not really a unique problem. Almost everything on Amazon&#x2F;aliexpress is the same white label junk. Buying brand name parts sometimes implys a brand name level of QC but its increasingly not the case.<p>As for ifixit I would treat the products sold in partnership with the OEM differently from the ifixit brand ones.\n\n            Agree on all points. However sometimes the OEM branded parts are bundled in packs with iFixit tools. Notably with the Pixel parts as an example.<p>Honestly I&#x27;d rather go direct to vendor for parts or service and decent turnaround and there&#x27;s only one that offers this I can name.\n\n              Ideally OEMs are best able to provide parts and service. The problem is too many have abused their position to restrict consumer choice. As long as parts and manuals are available to the user I&#x27;ve no problem with choice. The free market keeps everyone honest.<p>The problem is we have too many captured markets. I have a furnace yet as a user I&#x27;m not even allowed to see the manual. The HVAC people lobbied the EPA to make it hard for anyone but them to work on furnaces.\n\n    &gt; Soldered NAND is a wear item and a WAY bigger deal.<p>&quot;Citation needed&quot;. For anything resembling normal usage an SSD will last well beyond the economic lifetime of the rest of the components surrounding it. So why is it that big a deal to replace it?\n\n      I don&#x27;t think anyone has worked this out yet.<p>Literally 99% of laptops out there die and&#x2F;or are recycled with the stock configuration.<p>The first thing to go are the ports, batteries, screens, keyboards. I haven&#x27;t seen an SSD failure in a decade now and we have thousands of them in production and on people&#x27;s laptops.\n\n        My Macbook Air 2015&#x27;s SSD failed and I had it replaced. And at the same time had its battery replaced for the second time.\n\n      I&#x27;m sure my usage would be excessive compared to a normal user, but I find SSDs last 2-3 years on average. I buy Samsung, perhaps that&#x27;s the real issue\n\n      The problem is that there is no &quot;normal usage&quot; for a general purpose PC. It will run any software you want. I had a hyper-v bug that thrashed one of my SSD&#x27;s and when the M1 launches they had a swap bug that thrashed them as well. The reality is that if something is a wear item a non zero part of the population will wear it out. To toss a perfectly good logic board for a suicidal SSD is absurdity.\n\n  This reminds me of Louis Rossman’s long-term use review of his Framework 13 (1); he was hard on it and killed some of the ports, but thanks to them being swappable, was able to just slot a new one in.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6Sw06swtgY0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6Sw06swtgY0</a>\n\n    I think somewhere in the middle of the framework and Lenovo is appropriate. I don&#x27;t mind spending some time replacing ports but I do mind spending money on buying pluggable ones I&#x27;m going to plug in once.<p>Apple have the right approach (apart from having to remove the logic board to get at it): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;103915\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;103915</a> ... port boards are individually purchasable from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfservicerepair.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfservicerepair.com</a>\n\n      &gt; <i>Apple have the right approach</i> ...<p>Planned obsolescence through SoCs with no literature for system developers, soldered CPU, RAM, SSDs etc. and possible part-pairing on laptops and desktops was pioneered by Apple. I&#x27;d even go far as to say that the whole <i>Right to Repair</i> movement is an anti-Apple movement triggered by their hostility to consumer rights.\n\n        I think the planned obsolescence thing may not have any legs. My mother has a 9 year old Apple SoC in her pocket which is still getting software updates...<p>As for <i>all</i> the other things the claims are usable in both directions.<p>They&#x27;re still dicks though!\n\n          Yeah. No. My mothers Macbook&#x27;s display connector came loose after 3 years. No plausible way to fix it because the display cable is hidden under all the other components.\nAnecdotes aren&#x27;t the best, but there ARE reasons Apple got this reputation.\n\n            Is your problem it couldn&#x27;t be fixed or that you needed Apple to fix it?\n\n        You are forgetting John Deere’s contributions to these anti consumer practices\n\n          You are right. American farmers certainly deserve a lot of credit for advancing the Right to Repair movement in the US.\n\n      Looks like without a serial number you cannot even list the parts?\n\n    The swappable ports are my single favourite thing about the framework. I love them. I, personally, still use a microsd card reader all the time, and having one just there, not sticking out, is really useful.<p>I no longer need to carry a hub or dongle or whatever when I take my laptop places. Just a power adapter (though tbf I wouldn&#x27;t even need that if Framework had figured out battery life better).<p>Though as much as I like upgradability, I&#x27;m not sure it will make financial sense to upgrade instead of buy a new machine.\n\n  &gt; There is no way of effectively repairing the connector other than throwing the motherboard away<p>You&#x27;re exaggerating. NorthridgeFix on YouTube has probably dozens of videos of him replacing USB-C connectors. Yes, he sometimes has to replace the traces with pad strips, but that&#x27;s a long way to throwing the whole board away.\n\n    Not even slightly exaggerating. The repairs are overstated.<p>If you think these fixes last more than a few weeks you are probably mistaken. And due to the way footprints are designed for the shells there are occluded pins which can’t be resoldered or repaired. The end game is you have a USB-C connector that only works one way up on Thursdays when the moon is aligned with Jupiter.\n\n      uh you resolder the occulded pins the same way you solder occluded pins on say a BGA. With a heat and the right paste type. Its a bit tricky but should be doable. That said I like the framework solution better - hust protect the usb-c ports by adding a short extension.\n\n        Well you don&#x27;t because there is a row of pads stuck to the bottom of the connector which is torn off the board. You can only resolder and patch up the other row on the end of the connector body. The row that is torn off the board will <i>never</i> work again.<p>Also you may be lucky if it can do power delivery after that. You would be really lucky if it still works as USB hole and you&#x27;d be blessed if TB works over it after. They are pretty much transmission lines not DC.\n\n      People grind the multi-layer sandwich of iPhone connectors and BCP, restore traces on multiple layers and then get everything back so the phone is working.<p>It&#x27;s surely less trouble to restore just  a USB port.\n\n        Which people? How many are willing to guarantee such a repair will still work a year from now?\n\n          Charlatans preying on the poor and cheap I suspect.<p>As an actual qualified EE who used to design high speed digital and RF boards I can tell you that they might not even be working properly straight away, let alone a year from now. You&#x27;ll just find out in a year what the damage to your data was.\n\n          Quite surprisingly - the ones who make a living repairing the phones.<p>&gt; How many are willing to guarantee such a repair will still work a year from now?<p>Ah, yes, everyone should prefer to throw the device away because the repairman didn&#x27;t bid his head what the repair would outlive the repairman, device and device owner, amirite?\n\n  I bet you could get one of those magnetic usb-c 100w power connectors and fix this flaw for the most part simply by virtue of a breakaway connector that put minimal strain on the laptop.<p>Of course, those connectors don&#x27;t carry data, so for connecting to a dock you would still be sol.\n\n&gt; DIMM, keyboard, SSD and WWAN<p>Basically a return to the status quo of 10 years ago, isn&#x27;t it?<p>I am inclined to believe that this (as well as Dell&#x27;s Concept Luna) is a direct result of Framework&#x27;s existence and may not have happened without them in this form.\n\n  Probably, and that&#x27;s not a bad thing.<p>I know that my next laptop would have been a switch from ThinkPads to Framework, and it probably still will be, but I know that there are plenty or organisations that can&#x27;t move to Framework so having Lenovo fix this is great for many reasons.\n\n    Yeah, it&#x27;s great to see this kind of impact on other, way bigger vendors.\n\n  Those four things have almost always been replacement in many it not most thinkpads. This feels like pure marketing spin.\n\n    Actually, they had been moving towards towards soldering ram and SSD. So this is kind of a positive step back. Thanks frame.work ...!\n\n  HP EliteBooks 840&#x2F;5 and 640&#x2F;5 also have all that and hp publishes very nice videos how to take the machine completely apart\n\n  &gt; Basically a return to the status quo of 10 years ago, isn&#x27;t it?<p>couldn&#x27;t help but imagine: this is the start of the transition to LAAS - laptop as a service (via subscription&#x2F;advertising).  :)\n\n  It is like Bio being back to how we used to buy food before the big supermarket chains, although more expensive than it used to be.\n\nI use my laptop on a laptop stand on the couch and bed. Every time I slightly shift positions, the lap detection mode is triggered through the accelerometer (even though it&#x27;s not on my lap) and the power limit throttles to 11W. You can clearly tell Lenovo does not dog food their own products, nor do they care about them. They&#x27;ve also released broken bios updates which ends up bricking devices. I can find links if people want to know more, but I have stopped recommending ThinkPads to friends and family. The quality is no longer there.<p>This is not a company that cares about their products - just one that attempts to extract the maximum possible value out of its consumers.\n\n  I just replaced my daughter’s T14 gen 3 with a MacBook Air M2 because the thinkpad lasts 2 hours on battery and gets hotter than satan’s nuts. Terrible machine.\n\n    Weird, my AMD T14 gen 3 lasts 6-8 hours and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.\n\n      Yeah that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not the Intel variant :)<p>Incidentally I get about 13 hours on my MBP.\n\n        I have to use a Mac for work.<p>I&#x27;m fine not being subjected to MacOS in my spare time.\n\n          It&#x27;s the other way around here. I always run a different platform at home to work. It&#x27;s part of keeping sane in this industry.<p>Then again the latest macOS broke me completely. But it&#x27;s not like Microsoft haven&#x27;t done that several times...\n\n            Which is why I&#x27;m doing great with Fedora on my personal ThinkPad.\n\n              Consider yourself lucky.<p>I&#x27;ve wasted at least a full work week&#x27;s time figuring out whether speaker&#x2F;keyboard&#x2F;suspend&#x2F;lid&#x2F;forcepad&#x2F;stylus&#x2F;overheating&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;scaling&#x2F;dock&#x2F;HID audio&#x2F;application problems in my Z13 Gen 1 were caused by Lenovo, one of Lenovo&#x27;s partners, the Linux kernel, Fedora, Wayland + GNOME, or just cosmic radiation.\n\n      Still not enough for a long workday though.\n\n        No one is productively producing for over 8 hours non-stop.\n\n          True, but longer days happen once in a while and not having to carry a charger is nice.\n\n  To me it got bad around the time they gave up the docking station port and switched to USBC for that. We have such models at work now and they had multiple failures, like one USBC port dying, which was hilarious to figure out first because the docking station uses two, so it still half worked. Then the keyboard on one died. Another colleagues speakers died.<p>We had lots of models from the T series before, and while they were not all perfect they still worked perfectly and we usually got to take them home when they were replaced and they kept working for years to come after the inevitable battery swap.\n\n    Yup, planned obsolescence. Apple does it way more but it&#x27;s still unacceptable. Might as well go with any other brand then since they&#x27;re charging a premium anyway.\n\n  Ironically, when I have the laptop on my lap, there is enough clearance between my legs to let air through. If I put the laptop on a mattress, it gets ridiculously hot because it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> activate lap mode and the mattress makes a great seal on all of the chassis bottom edges.<p>It&#x27;s also a mismanagement of resources that someone is writing IMU drivers and some [clearly imperfect] decision logic, some other person is routing that IC onto the motherboard, the thing will need to be documented and bugfixed (and not necessarily by the same people that designed and wrote the thing), it adds another supply chain constraint, the whole subsystem is an unnecessary power consumption (even if it&#x27;s optimized to 50 or 20 uA)...<p>There are much bigger fires to extinguish at Lenovo with their hardware&#x2F;firmware&#x2F;vendor&#x2F;driver choices, and a handful of people are spending finite engineering resources on &quot;lap mode.&quot;\n\n    Yes. Complete mismanagement and ruins user productivity but can&#x27;t disable it &quot;due to legal&quot;. No gamer would allow this to happen on their gaming laptops (nor afaik have been sued) but according to Lenovo no office worker can put their laptops on their laps with more than 11W TDP being delivered to the laptop. It&#x27;s crazy.<p>The laptop stands readily available on amazon allow for airflow while being on a mattress, for example. Just poor design where you can tell they don&#x27;t care about their products. I will be replacing this unit with either Framework or a Tong Fang laptop which costs half as much but delivers twice the sustained TDP (54W) even when not on lap detection mode, provides proper cooling via 2 fans&#x2F;vacuum chambers and comes stock with PTM7950 - all things Lenovo keeps on devices that cost 2k+.<p>ThinkPads&#x2F;Lenovo no longer take pride in their products. It&#x27;s a milking machine.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superfish\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superfish</a>\n\n  &gt; Lenovo began to bundle the software with some of its computers in September 2014<p>Is this a threat even if I choose the option to purchase a computer without an OS?\n\n    Even if not that still tells you that you are not just buying a product but also are a product in Lenovo’s eyes\n\n    It wasn&#x27;t in ThinkPads.<p>It wasn&#x27;t only in Lenovo.<p>It was baked into the BIOS.<p>It only affected Windows, but Windows executed this pre-boot section and wouldn&#x27;t allow it to be bypassed so reinfected after a reinstall.<p>It&#x27;s removed by Windows Defender since 2015.<p>Is it a threat? Not at this point, but it should bring into question any Microsoft &quot;secure computing&quot; when they enabled this sort of behaviour with no way for users to protect themselves.\n\n  key takeaway:<p>&gt; Komodia was founded by Barak Weichselbaum, a former programmer for Israel&#x27;s IDF Intelligence Core\n\nCtrl+f &quot;CAMM&quot; \n0 results<p>Guess not\n\n  Amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=camm+memory<p>0 results<p>Sounds pointless.\n\n    LPDDR will never come in SODIMM. Hardly pointless.\n\n      It is when there&#x27;s no way for users to even replace it at this point!\n\nStill no left-and-right charge ports. Why Lenovo, why is this so hard?\n\n  Because it would add multiple dollars to the BoM.\n\n  And traditional docking stations, I mean the ones you snap the laptop on. I find them incredibly useful with my older thinkpads, and they solve the problem brilliantly.\n\nCan I have replaceable 95WHr of battery as there was previously?\n\nI guess it&#x27;s nice that it may be easier to repair, but Thinkpads have always been reasonably repairable, even if a bit fiddly.  They also last a long time in my experience (current one is at 8 years old, same as the last one I had).\n\nAs usual &quot;these new laptops are designed to optimally run Windows 11 and are poised to elevate productivity and streamline professional tasks.&quot;<p>Although apparently they are &quot;Windows 11 Pro, Linux certified&quot;, so lets see.<p>At least we get our RAM, battery and harddisks components back.\n\nDon&#x27;t forget to put the Wi-Fi card back in a slot!<p>I didn&#x27;t want this stupid, buggy Qualcomm Wi-Fi adapter in my AMD ThinkPad (probably one major cause of 6.7.x suspend hanging) and wanted to switch it out with an AX210, but I can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s soldered on.\n\nI just hope they upgrade their 1992 speakers to something useable.\n\n  Oh, and stop leaving the EQ&#x2F;optimization to drivers or Dolby Access. Those don&#x27;t make it into Linux.\n\nJust buy an old thinkpad not whatever this is.\n\n  To be fair, I have a T430, but we need modern alternatives for 2024 and beyond. Personally I want to see a laptop with AMD CPU, AMD dGPU and Thunderbolt 4 ports.\n\n    I use a x201 and a T430 fine in 2024. Your modern alternative is to get a macbook\n\nDoes it run completely with free software without binary blobs?\nAny advancements in this regard?\nThis is very important for sustainability in the long run.\n\nI had my department at the time buy me a P53 against their wishes; they wanted to get me a Dell workstation, since they had a partnership with Dell which included fast repair service etc.<p>I thought the P53 was the most reliable high end laptop I could get and was supposed to have an amazing keyboard.  Instead, the keyboard was average at best and the trackpoint much worse than my older Dell workstation.  Then, it was one hardware&#x2F;firmware problem after another, until a small water spill put the cherry on top: wrecked performance and now it cannot boot if not plugged in.<p>Once upon a time, Thinkpads had great, water-resistant keyboards and a solid build with reliable ports, but now this has become a fairy tale.  The article does not really address any of this.  I am never buying a Thinkpad again, although I really don&#x27;t know what my options are :(  I hear Dell is tanking the quality of their high-end workstations too.\n\nMy X1 gen 6 carbon has a broken USB charging port, which I could live with, but today the thunderbolt port also broke. Battery is also dead.\n\n&gt; &quot;[...] are AI PCs ready to take AI workflows to the next level&quot;<p>Every single thing has to be rubber-stamped with the magic word.<p>Part of me is sick of it, but another part of me is happy -- once it&#x27;s overused enough to make everyone sick of it, it&#x27;ll become an &quot;avoid&quot; word (e.g. we&#x27;re starting to see this with &quot;blockchain&quot;), and then it&#x27;ll go away.\n\nI&#x27;m frustrated with my T14s Gen 3 AMD&#x2F;P14s Gen 3 AMD -- the LCD panel is attached with tape[1] (!!) and my LCD panel has slipped down a few times. I dislike single-use adhesives. I wish for them to go back to screwing in the panel into the lid.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.lenovo.com&#x2F;pccbbs&#x2F;mobiles_pdf&#x2F;t14s_gen3_x13_gen3_hmm_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.lenovo.com&#x2F;pccbbs&#x2F;mobiles_pdf&#x2F;t14s_gen3_x13...</a> page 101 (labelled page 95)"

Adding &quot;narco-&quot; in front of any previous leader or official the author apparently doesn&#x27;t like doesn&#x27;t do much to help with clarity.<p>Hard to tell what&#x27;s going on from this article in that the author seems so biased against Prospera. Sounds like they made an agreement with one government that for various reasons lost power and that the new government wants to cancel the deal.\n\n    You can argue how often &quot;narco-&quot; should be used, but it&#x27;s more than just someone &quot;the author apparently doesn&#x27;t like&quot;. The ex-president and his brother are literally convicted drug traffickers.\n\n  i think the readability would be improved if the author tossed in the prefix &quot;crypto-&quot; a few dozen more times.\n\n  The actual statements from the parties involved - The Prospera ZEDE and the executive branch - are at the bottom and far more coherent and cordial than the rest of the article suggests.<p>The rest of the article is hyperbolic trash. “Immense bipartisan pressure from the US to maintain the Honduras charter cities” = “2 US senators writing a … letter”\n\n  It&#x27;s typical for some journalists. They just mash words together to make something look suspicious, but they don&#x27;t really have a point to make.\n\nLibertarian ideology colonialism attacking a souvreign nation state. Thing you do not see every day.\n\n  As I understand it, the previous govt invited the conquistadores and let them buy free reign.\n\n    And the souvreign changed his opinion on that. Corruption is not a trapdoor function, you can get rid of that.\n\n      You will also get rid of any trust from foreigners and, thus, any future foreign investment.<p>Sometimes keeping your word is more important that attainment of ideological purity. China can survive such a loss of trust, because it is a Behemoth of a nation and can live somehow regardless. Honduras much less so.<p>(I am saying this as a citizen of a small country who doesn&#x27;t like all our commitments either, but the alternative of just going back on our word would be fairly detrimental to us long term.)\n\n        Was there really ever any trust, except for the - we can get away with bribing people and steal stuff as fast as we can carry and can get away with it? A dishonest merchant will only meet dishonest people.\n\nThis was a shockingly biased and information-sparse article. Really disappointing\n\n  Team-based politics cause bad feels when you see your team being criticized\n\n    I mean if your team are the drug lords of the previous government, then whelp. Maybe you picked the wrong team.\n\n      Both teams are the wrong team. That’s precisely the point\n\n    I&#x27;m not on a team. I have never been to Honduras and have no strong feelings about either side. The whole article is just a journalist describing a conflict between two groups of humans, while constantly using morally and emotionally negative language against one group and never sharing their perspective, while doing the opposite for the other group. This journalist doesn&#x27;t even accurately describe the origin of the conflict, which the top comment here does. It&#x27;s a fun mental exercise to read the article and count sheer number of Russell conjugations.<p>This is not the kind of document you write to inform your reader about the state of the world.\n\nThe version of the story without all the fnords: Honduras solicited investment in the form of charter cities, where corporations could buy pockets of land and run them however they wanted.  Then a more socialist government came into power, reversed the law allowing them to exist, and refused to give them their money back. The biggest, Próspera, is suing to get their money back.<p>Worth noting, this is a standard risk in Latam and the government that introduced them made it a constitutional amendment with a ten-year reversal process, since they wouldn&#x27;t get any investors otherwise. The primary complicating factor here in Próspera&#x27;s lawsuit is that they have not actually lost their investment yet; nine years to go.<p>But Honduras&#x27;s response is to withdraw from the court system and legal framework that Próspera&#x27;s suing them in, the ICSID. If they actually go through with this, that&#x27;s going to be the end of most foreign investment in Honduras at all, charter city or otherwise. The ICSID is there to ensure that your investment stake won&#x27;t be confiscated by the government when political winds change; Honduras is withdrawing because it wants to do exactly that, and no investor will risk that happening to them.<p>Also despite the article saying &#x27;crypto&#x27; a dozen times their only relation to crypto is accepting it as legal tender, same as neighboring El Salvador. Instead of &#x27;DAOs avoiding the FTC&#x27; one should think &#x27;biotech avoiding the FDA&#x27;.\n\n  I wonder if all the huge manufacturing factories near San Pedro Sula&#x2F;Cortez will pack up and move to either El Salvador or Guatemala in response to this?\n\n  &gt; Honduras solicited investment in the form of charter cities, where corporations could buy pockets of land and run them however they wanted. Then a more socialist government came into power, reversed the law allowing them to exist, and refused to give them their money back.<p>No mention of democratically elected government being ousted by US-backed coup, or the fact that this single company is asking for a third of the country’s GDP.<p>On crypto: you seem very confident about your position, yet if you talk to actual people on the ground,  you’ll get a different story than you are proposing. Crypto advocates are bragging about this very subject. It started with El Salvador, but goes well beyond one country now.<p>And for the record… I am not anti-crypto. I have been involved with bitcoin for 9 years.\n\n    A “US-backed coup” is a bit misleading: Zelaya refused to follow the law, but the US didn’t back him - they tried to keep it from turning into a war before an election he was excluded from so the Honduran people could settle it democratically. I don’t like the realpolitik in avoiding recognizing his coup attempt as such but that’s not the same as backing him.\n\n      That is the narrative, sure, but is it the reality? Why would it ever be presented otherwise?<p>The US government refuses to follow its own laws.\n\n        It isn&#x27;t &quot;the narrative&quot;. The Honduran Supreme Court issues the arrest warrant. There was a congressional investigation that reviewed state department cables and found exactly what the part post is claiming.\n\n        <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_constitutional_crisis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_constitutional...</a><p>Zelaya was constitutionally barred from re-election.\n\n          Post-coup\n\n            No, he was term-limited to the single term allowed by the constitution and was running anyway, with a fig-leaf of a referendum for a proposed constitutional convention to retroactively legalize the second term, the timing of which could never have allowed him to legally run for president. This was a “constitutional coup” by the judiciary designed to prevent an illegal second term that was clearly otherwise going to happen.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Honduran_fourth_ballot_box_referendum\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Honduran_fourth_ballot_box_r...</a>\n\n        “Narrative” would be when you use “U.S.-backed coup” to describe a president refusing to leave office legally and the U.S. working to keep him out. There’s valid criticism that the U.S. should have been more aggressive in condemning it as a coup but none of the evidence suggests that the U.S. supported a coup in violation of Honduran law. The State department cables which were leaked show their focus was on preserving aid to people until a new election.\n\n  &quot;Political winds change&quot; like a US backed coup in 2009 that put the guy in power who made these laws? What international institution protects against that? Are countries bound by law if it was made by an illegitimate government?\n\n    Did you make an account just for this post?\n\n      Is that relevant to the question they asked?\n\n        yes.  this is an election year and GPT is a thing.<p>shillbots gonna shill.  this is a blatant one, which means it&#x27;s low-effort; here to stir the pot.  the real agi-prop effort will be a repost bot with a real looking history.\n\n          Nope. Real person, sorry! Yes i make a new account every time I lose my ddg session. Not llm spam. Just a very opinionated human&#x2F;dog\n\n    The only US involvement in ousting Zelaya was the State Department asking neighboring countries not to intervene. The Supreme Court of Honduras issued the arrest warrant for him on their own. It was an entirely internal affair until after they tossed him onto a plane. And on top of that, the guy was trying to illegally change the constitution.\n\n      It stretches credulity that the US wasn&#x27;t involved in some way. The state department had an opinion on what outcome they wanted [0] and it&#x27;d be out of character if they didn&#x27;t put their thumb on the scale as much as was necessary to get the outcome they wanted.<p>We don&#x27;t really need public acknowledgement to assume that the US is involved in American politics. If there is a coup in their back garden, they&#x27;ll have someone there doing some pruning.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Documents_on_US_role\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9t...</a>\n\n        Yes, I&#x27;ve read the wikipedia article too. I was also studying Latin America in college at the time and can read Spanish so I was pretty closely following the issue.<p>Having an opinion on the outcome you want doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re actively putting a thumb on the scale or driving events. The State Department has a position on almost ever major political event happening in the world. It can&#x27;t possibly be intervening in all of them.<p>&gt; If there is a coup in their back garden, they&#x27;ll have someone there doing some pruning.<p>Except the US specifically stayed out of this and encouraged Honduras&#x27;s neighbors not to get involved either. If the US had chosen to support Zelaya, then the people backing the Supreme Court would have called that a US intervention.<p>Is your standard that having an opinion on a foreign political outcome is tantamount to intervention? If not what is your standard and how does it apply here?\n\n  TIL what “fnord” is. I think that is a perfect way to describe much of this article.\n\n    _The Illuminatus Trilogy_ , where I learned this word, is a fantastic read.\n\n  When Ukraine told Russia it was not going to pay back loans (prior to invasion) the West applauded.<p>Today the West is seriously considering expropriating external Russian property. Also apparently there is nothing wrong with this.<p>But when a small country in what is &quot;rightfully&quot; the US&#x27; playground threatens to protect its sovereignty from US corporations, apparently this is a whole different story.\n\n    The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. --Thucydides\n\n  &gt; Honduras solicited investment in the form of charter cities, where corporations could buy pockets of land and run them however they wanted.<p>Bioshock: Jungle Edition\n\nI read about these charter cities a few years ago [0]. All the theory around them seemed to have this libertarian zeal about it that kind of put the foreign investors ahead of the local, voting population. And basic government functions (voting, taxes, police) were simply ignored or not fully explained.<p>BTW, for the Americans, there are lots of charter cities going up in Puerto Rico. And they are also unpopular because rich foreigners pay lower or no taxes compared to a PR citizen.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty&#x2F;308134&#x2F;?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-pol...</a>\n\n  Not all of them, these have led to real non-tourism job growth in PR. And PR is US territory, the tax breaks are for citizens who move from the mainland - not foreigners. It’s actually a great setup for software companies who are required to hire some locals.\n\n  Is this the latest incarnation of disaster capitalism? In the 00&#x27;s, companies were content to just capture the government and make it into what they wanted. Now it&#x27;s an explicit agreement that they can do what they want?<p>Those are real questions and not just snark, regardless of how snarky I actually feel about this entire thing.\n\n  I am cautious in supporting these particular cities, since democratic primacy is a critical right that empirically leads to better results. That dealt with, there is a frame here where democratic power is preserved. The idea is that voting is done with the feet. There are a lot of obvious ways that is worse than voting by vote, but it is a much more powerful action.<p>In the long term that sort of charter city would need to transition to either a more standard model or something like the City of London - eventually becoming a tightly controlled geographic area where not a lot of people actually live. It worked well for the UK, I imagine it would work well elsewhere. If anything, corporate control runs the risk of being too effective and ending up as the command structure of some sort of colonial superpower.\n\nHopefully Prospera wins and the socialist president loses. Honduras would benefit from more foreign investment. She&#x27;s not doing her people any favors.\n\nCrypto is [mostly] for crime, laundering, etc. When will the tech industry get past this?\n\n  Snapchat is mostly for porn?  Signal is mostly for drug dealers? Tor is mostly for pedophiles?<p>The early adopters of a technology are the users that need it the most, and have the highest opportunity cost from not using it.  You can think of them as beta-testers for the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; folks.  You are looking at the beginning of a technology and criticizing the beta-tester population.\n\n    The beginning? It’s been fifteen years. Hundreds of billions have been invested. We’ve been through several massive hype cycles.<p>If there is any potential for mainstream adoption of crypto, what exactly is holding it back at this point? It’s not new; it’s not obscure; and it’s certainly not underinvested.<p>Of course the crypto promoters will never admit that because the only reason to invest in crypto is this narrative — “it’s something brand new, very few people understand it, you can get in on the ground floor and be part of a revolution, etc.”\n\n      It is easy to understand the use-value: sovereignty over personal digital assets; sovereignty over transfer of said assets\n\n        Nobody seems to actually want that though. Most crypto owners just trade on centralized exchanges.<p>In practice, that sovereignty jargon is just an ideological veneer over unregulated penny stocks with no product-market fit.\n\n          &gt; Nobody seems to actually want that though. Most crypto owners just trade on centralized exchanges.<p>I&#x27;m talking about what is important to me. I don&#x27;t pretend to know what others want\n\n    when was the last time you bought anything with crypto?<p>like you drove to 7&#x2F;11, got gasoline, a soda, and some chips, and paid with BTC?<p>how many people do you know bought a house with BTC?  Not a BTC investment that they cashed out into USD, but just BTC?<p>Snapchat can be used for non-porn; BTC isn&#x27;t used for anything.\n\n      Can be used to buy things illegally. Think ADHD meds or sanctions breaking.<p>In an ideal world, the ADHD meds where I live should be made available by GP prescription to reduce the backlog. Right now, it takes years to get a diagnosis free of charge, or to get a prescription for thousands of USD.<p>Of course, somebody (the dealer) will be left holding the bag after it unravels. But it&#x27;s rich to ask sufferers to put their lives on hold.\n\n  Never?<p>Its a far more efficient &quot;bug bounty&quot; system than the tech industry has ever created. Far easier to get paid far more with far less liability.<p>Its the ultimate PvP game. far more efficient game against people for resources than walled garden finance or <i>society</i> has previously created. It will always attract participants.<p>And that&#x27;s before even getting to the relativity of your nation&#x27;s laws. Are you suggesting we care about some other country&#x27;s capital controls because crypto use gets around those ... too? Is our go to response &quot;wait, that&#x27;s illegal laundering to move that much money... in China&quot;<p>Its only confusing if you don&#x27;t think about it.\n\n  Banks still [probably] have their place. But so does technology which gives me complete sovereignty over my assets.\n\n  By that argument we should also eliminate the internet, yes?\n\n  It is. That said, I know a bunch of people who use it to buy ADHD medication, who can&#x27;t otherwise afford to get a prescription in a timely manner. And I don&#x27;t even know that many people! I suppose there&#x27;s many downsides to enabling crime, but there&#x27;s some silver lining."

Trying to update on Switch now and says I am up-to-date with 1.5.8\n\n  Console is soon. PC was today.\n\n    Awesome thanks\n\nAw I get warm comfortable feelings just reading this changelog. Not sure I&#x27;ve had that from a game before.\n\nConcernedApe is a gem. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s heartening or depressing to see how easily one guy with passion and a clear vision can utterly humiliate multi-billion dollar studios when it comes to producing games that are genuinely worth playing.\n\n  Despite what you hear on HN, 10x engineers are real.\n\n    The software engineering isn&#x27;t the impressive part of Stardew Valley. Aside from the multiplayer code (which is the only part he had outside help with), an average developer could cobble together a functionally similar engine in a weekend. What&#x27;s impressive about Stardew Valley is that one guy did all the coding <i>and</i> all the writing, all the art, all the music, and all the game design, while also managing to produce an instant classic that also happens to be his first game ever. The continued development pushed as free updates almost a decade after release is the icing on the cake; there is no explanation other than that he&#x27;s making this game because he loves doing it and he takes pride in his work, rather than trying to follow mainstream game dev dogma and try to produce a platform for soon-parting fools from their money.\n\n      Imo “10x engineer” is generally is referring a tenacious individual being adept at all skills, including soft-skills, relevant to shipping a product. Just like ConcernedApe.\n\n        I associate it with just doing things because they need doing. When I was young I’d always wonder how all these amazing things came to be. As I get older I realize it’s because someone just got started and has been plugging away at it for years.\n\n        I mean no shade to ConcernedApe but shipping a product that you built yourself entirely does not really showcase “soft skills” tbh.<p>If anything it showcases his hard skills because he did everything.\n\n    Making a game like stardew valley isn&#x27;t a 10x engineer feat.<p>Unless I&#x27;m missing something complex about the game? It seems like it&#x27;s just a basic game with decent old-world storytelling and game mechanics.\n\n      Why don&#x27;t we have more of them?\n\n        Same reason we don’t have a lot of professional athletes, billionaires, or unicorn startups. It’s not easy and not everyone is capable of doing it. Takes luck, hard work and probably a bit of genetic lottery.\n\n          I meant games like Stardew Valley.<p>I was implying no one else has made this game so maybe ConcernedApe is in fact 10x\n\n            Harvest Moon came out in 1996 and is basically the same game.\n\n              So two in 28 years...\n\n                No. That&#x27;s just the first one I know. It was done back in 1996.<p>It just reduces your implication that he is a 10x developer. He may or may not be, but this game doesn&#x27;t reflect that.\n\n        Because we don&#x27;t actually like playing old good games for very long, especially when there are a lot of them. Most people don&#x27;t want to revisit the same good takes on games. The same way people don&#x27;t want endless episodes of good TV shows, even though that&#x27;s exceptionally harder to do.\n\n  I think he&#x27;s mainly been working on Haunted Chocolatier now. Very excited to see how that comes out! The releases starting with Stardew 1.3 in 2018 have had others involved, including:<p>&gt; Arthur Lee, “Mr. Podunkian” (1.4 &amp; 1.5 updates), Tom Coxon (Multiplayer net code in 1.3), Alex Erlandson, “Zillix” (1.4 update), Sickhead Games (Console ports), The Secret Police (Mobile ports)<p>(full credits can be found in the game’s title screen)\n\n  Definitely heartening. Games like Stardew Valley demonstrate that an individual (or small team) can make worthy games and be recognized for it.<p>As for multi-billion dollar studios, why would they be humiliated by such games? They have completely different objectives.\n\n    &gt; They have different completely different objectives.<p>they sure do.  and one of those really makes me wonder how incredible things would be if we restructured what we incentivize.<p>i’ll echo what so many others in this thread have already said,  stardew valley blew me away once my gf finally convinced me to play.  it would be hard to overstate what a fantastic fun little world he built.  i went into a little local computer shop the other day and they had the stardew music playing—i hadn’t played in like 3 years but that music immediately glazed over me like  i was there in the game.<p>what an absolute gem.<p>corp studios and stardew developers definitely have different objectives and holy shit what a stark difference in outcomes.\n\n  I have a ton of respect for ConernedApe, but I think it’s worth pointing out that Stardew Valley, especially the original 1.0 version, is almost completely cribbed from Harvest Moon.\n\nThe development of Stardew Valley is such a heartwarming story about how if you&#x27;re a wonderfully talented artist, musician, writer and programmer, all you really need is XNA to make a fantastic game beloved by a massive, diverse audience.<p>I would still generally prefer Godot for C# 2D game development these days, but if you really just want a light framework, MonoGame &#x2F; FNA have had a really strong track record in commercial indie games.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily about talent, it&#x27;s about effort.<p>As an example, in early versions of Stardew Valley, if you named your horse with the same name as one of the townspeople, you would be riding around your farm on top of the townsperson&#x27;s sprite. As in, in the game code, the display name of the object was used to identify which sprite to render.<p>That&#x27;s not really the type of mistake I&#x27;d expect a &quot;talented&quot; (or at least, an &quot;experienced&quot;) software developer to make, but ConcernedApe managed to put together an amazing game in spite of any inexperience or difficulty with the programming side.<p>It&#x27;s like they say - 10% inspiration, 90% perspiration. Or similarly, &quot;skill is the sum of aptitude and experience&quot;.\n\n  Don&#x27;t forget luck!<p>I don&#x27;t mean that in a dismissive sense — hard work is obviously very important.<p>But more in the sense that if you&#x27;re talented and hard working and <i>aren&#x27;t</i> successful, it&#x27;s not necessarily because you did something &quot;wrong&quot; or didn&#x27;t work hard enough. Sometimes there&#x27;s just no substitute for being in the right place at the right time.\n\nThat&#x27;s a lot of changes.  Is it all one guy&#x27;s labor of love still?\n\n  Mostly yes.  He has hired people to contribute on occasion, especially with ports to other platforms (like mobile), but it&#x27;s mostly just his baby.\n\nSo happy this game keeps growing.\n\nI highly recommend reading &quot;Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made&quot;. It does a deep dive into the development histories of a bunch of different games. Some of them turned out to be wildly successful. Some not so much. Stardew Valley is one of the games it covers, going through all the ups and downs in its single-handed five year (!) development cycle.\n\n  Thanks, I got the book on Libby and I&#x27;m enjoying it so far :)\n\nI&#x27;m pleased to see this on HN!  This game is actually wonderfully hackable because the save file format is just unobfuscated XML, and it writes at very predictable times (saves at the end of the &quot;day&quot; and it will tell when it writes to the file).  Also the game doesn&#x27;t use any DRM (it&#x27;s available on gog.com!).<p>I deeply appreciate that the dev (Concerned Ape) doesn&#x27;t try to obfuscate save data.  It has given the game a lot more value for me because after playing it &quot;normally&quot; I was able to experiment by tweaking parts of the save file to see what would happen.  It&#x27;s turned somewhat into an educational tool as well as I&#x27;ve used it to teach my kids how to open the hood and take a look!  It also made it possible to &quot;fix&quot; things like getting unfairly killed in a battle because the controller died at the worst possible time.  I actually `git init` in the save file directory so I can keep my save file in version control.  It does get pretty big as you get late into the game.<p>Even if you aren&#x27;t a gamer, you should check this game out.  It runs on everything, and it is a super chill and cosy game to play.  It&#x27;s very well-balanced to give you a lot of game play, but also a lot of freedom.  It&#x27;s very, very hard to &quot;fail&quot; so you can play very casually.  My 6 year old daughter loves this game, as do I, so it spans the range of ages.\n\n  I was glad they ported it to mobile<p>But needing to adjust the save state to anytime instead of at the end of the day really did break the mechanic for me<p>They (dev and community) recognized their casual mobile gaming audience would not have uninterrupted dedicated time to complete a day effectively. Made it more accessible but the lack of urgency makes it a different game\n\n    Unless you&#x27;re talking about save scumming, I don&#x27;t see how the save mechanism changes anything. If anything, it makes the game easier that it only saves at night so that you can undo the whole day if you don&#x27;t like the outcome.<p>I don&#x27;t think 99% of people care when it saves, and they probably treat the game as if it&#x27;s constantly saving anyways.\n\nWay down under the multiplayer fixes:<p>&gt; &quot;Mitigated potential remote code execution issue.&quot;<p>Would be interested to learn more or see a postmortem of that issue\n\nFor anyone who&#x27;s on the fence about trying stardew valley, I&#x27;d love to take this moment to say try it. Get it. Keep it in your library. You won&#x27;t be disappointed..<p>The first time I played I was enamored with the impressive delivery of a sole developer.. as I played on I realised how it&#x27;s so much it&#x27;s own beautiful thing, then realised it&#x27;s my own thing..<p>I went away from it for a month or so and something reminded me about it and when I went back in I felt that &quot;home&quot; comfort feeling again without knowing I missed it.. this update has done it again.<p>It&#x27;s an incredible game yes, but it&#x27;s very cliché to say , it&#x27;s really a bit more than just a game determining the min max. It&#x27;s one of the best games to remind me it&#x27;s not about &quot;beating&quot; a game sometimes..<p>Really a masterpiece that for me at least will never be forgotten.\n\n  The only thing I regret is that I can’t play it for the first time twice.\n\n  I loved the setting and the style but it seemed very grindy and monotonous after a while. Maybe I&#x27;m not the target audience but manually watering a field full of virtual plants is just not my idea of fun. I guess eventually you can automate a lot of this?\n\n    Right, there are sprinklers for the watering, then another grade. (Iridium grade is the top, auto waters larger grids). I personally associate grind with &#x27;required boring busy work&#x27;.. If that&#x27;s what you like, you can do that, if you want to automate it, you can do that, its like factorio in a sense, without the pollution factor. :)\n\n  I never got into it single player but I&#x27;m having fun with my girlfriend on local multiplayer (Nintendo Switch) since we can split up the duties.<p>I like to head straight to the mines, she likes to take care of the farm&#x2F;animals.\n\n  I love that you love it so much. I put about ten hours into it to see what the hype was about a while back and had to stop…because otherwise I would’ve put in way more lol.\n\nStardew Valley is one of the few games that works for a range of kids from 4-40yrs old. There is something slow, something exciting, something requiring coordination, something allowing you to be creative, something that tells a story, etc...<p>Everyone&#x27;s needs are met at whatever speed they are at.<p>I have no idea why Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and all of the similar console games made their games 1 player. That&#x27;s the whole point of a console (to play with people).<p>Warning, the switch only supports 2 player. Xbox works fine, but using a PC gives you access to all the mods. I recommend the PC&#x2F;Steam version + 4 xbox controllers running on whatever weak media center you have.\n\n  The dearth of couch coop games is annoying horrible.<p>I’m going to have to fire up the old switch as it seems they’re the only ones with even some that are both couch coop and little kid friendly.\n\n  This update allows for up to 8 people on the PC version!!\n\nGlad to see this here! About a month ago I was ready to start a new farm and held off to wait for this update. I haven&#x27;t read the changelog because I want to go in blind to any updates, but I&#x27;m constantly amazed by ConcernedApe.<p>One of my favourite things about Stardew Valley is seeing how different people play- I like having lists of things to do, but always celebrate the festivals and mingle with the townsfolk. My brother has spreadsheets on top of spreadsheets to min&#x2F;max crop yields. And we both have a great time!\n\nCan someone explain the allure of that game using game mechanic terms?\n\n  the world the game creates is fun. it really is that simple.<p><i>tangential but kinda related</i>:\nive spent an embarrassing amount of time gaming — my grandpa told me one time, be wary of people who refuse to have pure fun. being the contrarian shitbag i can sometimes be, i brushed him off never fully understanding what he meant until i played through most of this game.\n\n    But what in the mechanics make it fun?<p>I’ve never played the game and everyone is raving about it but I have kids to take care of so I don’t really have the time to check it out.\n\n      It&#x27;s an engine builder. You grow your crops so you can sell them and buy more seeds so you can build chicken coops so you can build a barn so you can build kegs to make cheese, wine, etc etc."

      "conversation_text": "I live in Dubai, and the rains this year appear to be more frequent than the last two years. Perhaps the new seeding material is showing results\n\nI wonder if large-scale cloud seeding could have the effect of taking rain from places that would otherwise get it?\n\n  It would have to, unless you also consciously increase the rate of evaporation at the same time. Could be bad news for countries with arid neighbors to their direct west.\n\n    Sounds a bit like the dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over Nile Water (Ethiopia is building a dam) so definitely plenty of political precedent for conflict over water resources and this will exacerbate this.\n\n    I don’t think it can be assumed. if the rain increased  vegetation, i wouldn’t rule out an increased water cycle and greater amount of water in the area in general. Honestly, i wouldn’t be surprised if it benefited neighbors. I’m no expert and there are countless variables, maybe a high percentage of the rain used then sent right into the ground as waste water- never to have the chance to evaporate. or never taken up by vegetation at all. Time reveals all, despite whether this was a hasty experiment.\n\n      True, while it will certainly remove moisture from the air that would necessarily have fallen elsewhere, it&#x27;s difficult to say whether or not it would cause measurable decreases in rainfall in places that would notice it. For example, we know that reforestation actually increases precipitation downwind, as trees draw water out of the Earth, which then evaporates out of their leaves. However, a nation that&#x27;s seeding clouds isn&#x27;t going to be doing it because they&#x27;re trying to create rainforests, they&#x27;ll be doing it because they want agriculture and clean drinking water, and it&#x27;s unclear whether or not that can possibly give more than it takes from downwind neighbors.\n\n  Possible but a lot of rain just falls in the middle of the ocean, so not a great loss.\n\n    If that moisture they&#x27;re making fall out of the sky is guaranteed to end up falling above the ocean otherwise then sure. Otherwise you&#x27;ll get conflict.\n\n    Which will now wash a load of filth from the land into the ocean instead.\n\n  the moisture has to come from somewhere, nothin is free\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makerain.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makerain.com&#x2F;</a>\n\nIt&#x27;s amazing how much new tech is getting tested in the middle east. In the next 30 years I think they are the future.\n\n  This tech is not really new - in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, &quot;cloud seeding&quot; airplanes have been flying for years (to avoid hailstorms rather than to make it rain), although the efficacy of the method is disputed, so it&#x27;s not really widespread. I only learned that this is done where I live when I saw a small airplane flying dangerously close to an approaching storm (which GA aircraft usually do their best to avoid) and then read an article about how they miscalculated the strength&#x2F;direction of the storm and barely managed to avoid it.<p>Wikipedia article (only available in German): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hagelabwehr#Einsatz_in_Deutschland\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hagelabwehr#Einsatz_in_Deutsch...</a><p>Article about the history of anti-hail airplanes in the Rosenheim region: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hagelabwehr-rosenheim.de&#x2F;geschichtliches.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hagelabwehr-rosenheim.de&#x2F;geschichtliches.php</a>\n\n    It&#x27;s been happening in the US for quite awhile too.<p>For example, Colorado regularly performs cloud seeding and other weather modification techniques - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cwcb.colorado.gov&#x2F;focus-areas&#x2F;supply&#x2F;weather-modification-program\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cwcb.colorado.gov&#x2F;focus-areas&#x2F;supply&#x2F;weather-modific...</a>\n\n  It&#x27;s a huge pile of dead sand with load of petrol... They&#x27;re fighting the clock to stay relevant by buying all kind of foreign assets and attracting investors but no amount of tech will change the fundamentals\n\n&gt; The United Nations projects that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will face absolute water scarcity across the world. The Middle East stood out as one of the most water-stressed areas with around 83% of the population in the region prone to experiencing high levels of water stress.<p>&gt; Weather forecasters at the center can observe precipitation patterns in clouds and identify suitable clouds to seed, with the aim of increasing the rate of rainfall. Once they spot the right cloud, they instruct pilots to take to the air with their specialized aircrafts loaded with hygroscopic flares on the plane’s wings.<p>I wonder if someone did the math of what that would look like at scale. How much would using kerosene to deliver the cloud seed material to introduce rain accelerate the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve here? We can only hope that we find a way to electrify that fleet of airplanes or switch to something that&#x27;s much less energy intensive like drones.\n\n  The weather is not the problem. Overpopulation is. And it is a local problem, so limiting population elsewhere doesn&#x27;t help.\n\n    You can call it overpopulation, I call it underdesalination. There is lot&#x27;s of sun there and lot&#x27;s of seawater.\n\n      According to ChatGPT it takes at least 3 kWh to desalinate 1000l of salt-water.<p>Following that math and its estimates on solar panels that would come down to 0.003 m^2 of solar panels per liters.<p>UAE is about 83.6 billion m^2, lets assume half of that can be covered in solar panels, so that would be enough to desalinate 13 trillion liters of water.<p>That sounds like it could be enough for a country like UAE by a factor of 10, if ChatGPT&#x27;s math is right (probably not) and water can be desalinated instantly (probably not).\n\n        If your thought experiment leads you to consider that half the country, or even 5% of the country, should be covered in solar panels, then there a problem somewhere.\n\n        So your reference is “According to ChatGPT”.  \nDid you feel anything when typing this?\n\n          So, your argument is &quot;you used ChatGPT for this&quot;. They didn&#x27;t even write the comment with GPT, they just used it as a starting point for some napkin math. The other commenter not only dismissed the idea, but also emphasized how unrealistic and poorly planned it is by responding to the contents of the content, including how absurd it would be to implement that much solar coverage. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fun to make fun of the large language model, but at least it provided some drive to the conversation, even if its value was in being corrected. Did you feel like <i>your</i> addition was significant?\n\n            No, I didn‘t intend to make an argument, I was asking a genuine question because I‘m trying to understand the perspective on the world of people who consider LLM a kind of „source“.  \nTo me OP reads like “according to my Ouija board” and I’m frightened by the idea that people on HN are using the output of LLM as “quotable facts” (and not as a tool to start further research outside of it, which would be fine IMO.)  \nI’d like to know if the poster had any doubts using ChatGPT as a source of fact to base their calculations on, when they obviously had access to the internet with all necessary sources to properlt calculate an answer for this basic question.\n\n      Desalination is expensive, but it’s not just about the desalination simply pumping water up hill is costly.<p>Nevada averages 5,500 ft above sea level.  Moving 1 acre foot of water up that high at 100% efficiency takes ~5.6 MWh and a single mid sized farm can use that much water hourly.<p>Start talking 25 inches of water per year across <i>millions</i> of acres and you’ll need a <i>lot</i> of solar.  Worse, commercial reverse osmosis desalination only removes around 95-99% of salt so that farmland is quickly getting degraded.\n\n        Then don&#x27;t farm in Nevada?? Humans don&#x27;t consume that much water and lot of it can be recycled.\n\n          Humans generally use negligible mounts of water, the only meaningful water shortages are based around agriculture.\n\n        So don’t do water intensive farming in Nevada?\n\n          Nevada is just an example South Dakota is only 2,200 feet above sea level, but now you need an extra long pipe causing its own issues.<p>The point is desalination isn’t some magic fix that makes everything ok.  The remaining salt is probably the biggest issue.\n\n            &quot;The point is desalination isn’t some magic fix that makes everything ok. The remaining salt is probably the biggest issue.&quot;<p>No, but it is a whole lot easier close to the sea. Like most of UAEs cities are. The remaining salt, you could just pipe out in the ocean, if you go in some km towards a current and spread it out enough. Salt in the ocean is only a local problem, if it does not diffuse quickly enough.<p>And for deserts with a high altitude or that are more inland, no, desalination is probably not the solution.\n\n              Salt in the desalinated water not salt in the ocean.\n\n        take a black pvc pipe,stick one end into seawatter,add destillation collection crevices and overflowholes,put the other end up  high on a hill\n\n          That doesn’t work.  There’s a pressure difference across a desalinization system, it doesn’t output high pressure water.\n\n            its desalination and pumping via destillation by sunlight. it works.<p>its basically a heat driven capillary system.\n\n              &quot;5,500 ft above sea level&quot;<p>What your talking about works on small hills near sea level, but runs into real physical limitations.  It&#x27;s also slow and thus vastly more expensive per acre foot than commercial systems.\n\n      You can&#x27;t fix shortage of agricultural or industrial water with desalination because you end up with a bag of  potatoes for $50<p>Desalination only solves water shortages for human consumption. Water shortages mean famine<p>A single hectare of potatoes need about 7,000 tonns &#x2F; m3 of water. Desalination costs  $1&#x2F;m3, The cost of growing russet type potatoes for the fresh market was \n$2032 per acre. So potatoes will be 3 times more expensive<p>For wheat, the difference is even worse\n\n        True, but if you want to grow in the desert, there are more efficient methods and crops to grow, like in closed greenhouses, that keep most of the water.\n\n        Why not ship the potatoes in?\n\n    People screaming overpopulation are always and everywhere on a slippery slope to eugenics.<p>Carrying capacity is mediated by technology. WRT water, wastewater reclamation and desalination have a lot of gains that aren’t widely deployed. Also rewilding and reforestation can do a lot to mitigate creeping aridity.\n\n      This doesn&#x27;t have to be true anymore. Not all &quot;we have too many people&quot; people believe we need to FORCE depopulation. We have strong reason to believe that simply giving people sex ed, ample forms of birth control, and women&#x27;s rights leads to a self selection of fewer children. Every country that has done these things has seen its fertility drop.<p>Personally the earth can easily, EASILY, support more than ten billion humans if we stop being so damn stupid about resource utilization. Remember that we already produce an immense oversupply of food. Every human that is hungry is not a resource production problem, but a lack of empathy problem. The earth can only struggle to supply billions of humans if you insist that nothing can happen without a strong profit motive.\n\n        &gt; Every country that has done these things has seen its fertility drop.<p>And this result is somehow supposed to be a good thing? Every country that has this result, no matter how we theorize that it got there in the first place, is now facing a demographic crisis\n\n        &gt; that simply giving people sex ed, ample forms of birth control, and women&#x27;s rights leads to a self selection of fewer children.<p>The devil is in the details here, and programs focused on contraceptives in developing nations have a very checkered recent history.<p>&gt; the earth can easily, EASILY, support more than ten billion humans if we stop being so damn stupid about resource utilization<p>This is sort of what I&#x27;m driving at.\n\n          You better give some references about this &quot;checkered recent history&quot; because for example the programs US had for Africa were removed by GWB in the beginning of century when there was still less then billion of people in Africa. Now there is close to twice as that and Africa is not able to feed itself because population is growing faster than its capacity to produce food.<p>Normally those who stand against birth control have some very clear political agenda to use the size of the population in their advantage.\n\n            I&#x27;m not making an argument against birth control.<p>So as an example of checkered history, I&#x27;m referring to things like the push for circumcision as a measure to fight AIDs which has counterintuitively lead to a drop in condom usage in some places[1]. This is a great example of well meaning people from Europe and the US intervening in a way that makes things worse.<p>There have been concerns around HIV risk with DMPA[1] and ethical concerns about around the initial trials of the drug[3].<p>There were forced sterilizations in South Africa as recently as 2005[4].<p>There were similar issues in Kenya in the early 2010s[5].<p>My point was that people should look upon population alarmists with some skepticism, and when they talk about birth control in Africa I think it merits extra scrutiny.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3362967&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3362967&#x2F;</a><p>[2]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7232639&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7232639&#x2F;</a><p>[3]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;17441692.2019.1634118\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;17441692.2019.1...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-africa-51637751\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-africa-51637751</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hhrjournal.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;kenya-forced-sterilization-hiv&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hhrjournal.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;kenya-forced-sterilizatio...</a>\n\n              I don&#x27;t see how any of this is relevant to the issue. I&#x27;m talking about birth control that is family planning, programs that provide contraceptives and these incidence are something completely different.\n\n                My original statement was &quot;programs focused on contraceptives in developing nations have a very checkered recent history.&quot;.<p>Forced sterilization falls neatly in that category.\n\n                  These examples are about infectious disease control and not about family planning.\n\n    That&#x27;s acting like we don&#x27;t literally trade resources globally to maintain our population level\n\n      We can do this because the overpopulation is not happening globally. If for example Ukraine and Russia had the same population growth than Africa and Middle East is having then there wouldn&#x27;t be no grain available for Africa or Middle East. But there are limits to overpopulation and it is water.\n\nCloud seeding is illegal in Utah, because you&#x27;re taking rain that would have fallen on someone else&#x27;s field and making it fall on your field. Water rights are a serious business here in the desert.<p>It&#x27;s not that we <i>can&#x27;t</i> do these things, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not always a good idea.\n\n  California &amp; Nevada actively practice cloud seeding, I wonder if that affects Utah.\n\n  Why are these people farming in the desert to begin with?\n\n    Because if they weren&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t be there?\n\n    There are a -lot- of stuff grown in desert climates, believe it or not.  I think it&#x27;s a fine idea, just that the price needs to accurately reflect the water usage and only then determine if it&#x27;s worth continuing or not.  Right now it&#x27;s not really factored in at all, and cities are starting to crunch for water.<p>As an anecdote, I currently live in the desert, and the pecan farmers nearby use so much water that we get mosquitos pretty badly at times of the year.\n\n  &gt; rain that would have fallen on someone else&#x27;s field<p>Or in the ocean?\n\nin Dubai and whatever they’re doing this definitely working - over just the last month-ish we’ve had a 4-8 days of extremely heavy rains (and gov alerts to stay in), when just two years ago it’d be a surprise if it rained 3 days all year\n\n  That&#x27;s actually climate change and the desert is prone for that. I don&#x27;t think they are seeding these heavy rains as usually they can turn into a disaster.\n\n&gt; The NCM said it does not use any harmful chemicals in its operations. “Our specialized aircrafts only use natural salts, and no harmful chemicals,” the organization told CNBC.<p>How many times have companies been wrong about the harm chemicals they use in products have on humans and the rest of nature? How many times have they simply withheld knowledge of harmful chemicals in consumer products or outright lied?<p>I think weather control is a mistake because I cannot trust those leading or manufacturing it. Even if someone posts a link documenting the exact chemical composition being used in these cloud seeding projects, it won&#x27;t mean much to me because I am not a chemist and I am also jaded with a lifetime of reading about companies producing harmful products that they insisted are benign or even healthy. I don&#x27;t trust what they publish anymore by default. We have to breath the air they are pumping those &quot;salts&quot; into, we have to drink the water.\n\n  It shouldn&#x27;t be absolutely impossible to trust them. If ie those &#x27;salts&#x27; are naturally occurring in atmosphere in already reasonable concentration (ie I am sure few atoms of uranium are roaming around me currently, but sure as hell I hope its just few and apart) and they just locally temporarily increase their concentration to seed droplets around dew point.<p>But that&#x27;s probably about it, anything else and I agree with you.\n\n    I will do some reading up on the different techniques being used. I am just at a low point in my trust for companies at the moment.\n\n    &gt; If ie those &#x27;salts&#x27; are naturally occurring in atmosphere in already reasonable concentration (ie I am sure few atoms of uranium are roaming around me currently, but sure as hell I hope its just few and apart) and they just locally temporarily increase their concentration to seed droplets around dew point.<p>In this particular case, they are not using anything that is already floating around in our atmosphere. They created some proprietary seeding agent they only refer to as &quot;nano material&quot; and that it contains titanium oxide. Who knows what impact it will have.<p>&gt; Al Mandous said the center started manufacturing its own seeding agent called nano material, a fine salt coated with titanium oxide, which is more effective than what it uses currently.<p>Doesn&#x27;t a seeding agent described as a &quot;nano material&quot; that is coated in tatanium contradict their earlier claim that they &quot;only use natural salts?&quot;<p>&gt; “Our specialized aircrafts only use natural salts, and no harmful chemicals,”\n\nBased on this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-arab-emirates&#x2F;precipitation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-arab-emirates&#x2F;precipitat...</a> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working or making any real change.<p>There are two clues for this: 1. There is no mention of historical precipitation improvements in the article; and 2. If it was successful I&#x27;d expect more countries to be doing it.\n\n  China practices cloud seeding. You find it being used in odd places, but it isn&#x27;t very rare.\n\nHere in Calgary we use cloud seeding to reduce the impact of hail storms. If meteorologists predict a hail storm, they will seed the clouds outside of urban territory to reduce the property damage caused by the hail\n\nI imagine it would take a very serious effort to green up a hard desert like that, but it is well known that forests are capable of generating rain through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration.<p>Some large scale projects have already been undertaken, such as the restoration of the loess plateau in China, or the currently ongoing effort to establish a green belt across Africa to stop the Sahara desert from spreading southward."

      "conversation_text": "Very good read. We definitely deserve healthy innovation that contributes to human flourishing.\n\n&gt; <i>These people literally come to the event to learn about new things, and even they are gagging on this stuff.</i><p>I remember the reactions on &#x2F;r&#x2F;technology when the iPhone or the iPad were announced. I remember the reactions when the M1 processor came out. Just like this audience, lots of people who subscribe to this stuff nominally care about new technology. But the truth is that where I religiously chant &quot;We&#x27;re ARSENAL, ARSENAL FC, we&#x27;re by far the greatest team the world has ever seen&quot; they chant something else.<p>These reactions are meaningless. &quot;The iPAD?! It&#x27;s four iPhones stuck together HAHAHAHA and named after a MENSTRUAL PAD HAHAHA this is going to flop&quot;.<p>The difference is that Arsenal will only fail to win the Champion&#x27;s League once every year. These guys die a thousand deaths every day they see new technology.\n\n  I remember the reactions when the first M1 macbook actually landed in people&#x27;s hands and honestly can&#x27;t remember a single one which wasn&#x27;t at least &#x27;well I&#x27;ll be damned this is actually ok&#x27; - and the great majority was &#x27;this is a revolutionary device&#x27;.<p>This kinda never happens in football, sorry ^_^\n\n    “I can do everything at the same time”\n“u got the pro?”\n“No bro it’s the air”\n\n    Yes, exactly. The people who use things like them. It was the same with the iPad. The ones who bought them loved them. But the groupies were booing all the way into it dominating that market sector.<p>These people, nominally technology enthusiasts, appreciate very little.\n\nI remember Steve Jobs being heavily mocked at the time of the iPad release. So this maybe isn’t as new as the author claims.\n\nI can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly when it happened, but in the last decade or so, the message coming from the tech industry has been less <i>&quot;technology will improve your life and help you be a better human being&quot;</i> and more <i>&quot;technology will replace you as a human being and make you obsolete.&quot;</i><p>I think this is a big, big mistake and a large reason why AI specifically and the tech industry in general is being perceived negatively. SV seems less interested in making &quot;cyborgs&quot; that enhance human abilities, and more interested in godlike AIs that aren&#x27;t human at all.\n\n  Ask truckers about this with the nearly decade long plus narrative that the second self driving is mastered they will be laid off, combined simultaneously with complaints about how no one is entering the lucrative trucking industry.<p>I’ve had non tech family and friends who are currently dealing with the result of American cutthroat capitalism and barely able to cover living expenses despite having two people working full time, ask me how I felt about the risk of AI to my job.<p>My answer has consistently been that I’m not afraid because one of these results happens. A: AI hits a peak soon and can’t replace any work I do, so it doesn’t matter. B: AI does get sophisticated enough to replace the work I do at which point we’ve basically reached almost star trek level tech where machines can do most of the work and we’ve allocated resources through society in a way that everyone benefits. And lastly the one I think is most likely C: AI automates all this knowledge work for the benefit of company owners and we end up either accepting it as a group and falling back to pre industrial serf like social structures or every rises up in a social revolution.<p>To be honest I’d expect that going back to serfdom style rules would be the most expected and stable but the current group of western oligarchs don’t seem to care to make sure that their burgeoning serf class have their basic needs met and instead want to antagonize them for not being rich. It’s a really odd juxtaposition of rabidly independent culture where people believe they accomplished everything by the sweat of their own brow crossing with the results of of a society that lets an individual run a company of 10s to 100s of thousands of employees at the same time\n\n    Having your serfs&#x27; basic needs met was very rarely a care of the ruling classes in any state form that deserves the name &quot;serfdom&quot;. Serfs dying in a famine was just one of those things that happened. There was perhaps a brief reversal after the Black Death, when so many serfs had died there was almost a competition for the labor of the survivors.<p>My counter-argument to C: (I almost typed C:\\&gt; there, sorry) is that money in tech, in the end, still comes from people. Even if your business is using AI to optimise ad targeting, those ads still get paid for because the advertisers expect humans to hand over money at some point to buy products or play games or something.\n\n      Serfs might decide to kill the local lord. And most local lords didn&#x27;t have a huge standing army to prevent that.<p>So you don&#x27;t sound too correct.\n\n        With the exception of Switzerland, this didn&#x27;t tend to go too well in the middle ages - the early modern age was the first time this became viable &quot;at scale&quot;, hence the French Revolution.<p>There were plenty of earlier cases of one family of minor nobility killing another family of minor nobility and taking over their farmland and serfs, but successful peasant revolts that led to a change in the hierarchy were really rare (outside of Switzerland). Even the 1381 &quot;Great Revolt&quot; in England, which called for the abolition of serfdom among other things, is evaluated by the World History Encyclopaedia [1] as &quot;largely unsuccessful&quot; despite having many factors in its favour: a rise in the bargaining power of surviving peasants after the Black Death, and peasants armed and trained with knight-killing longbows. And yet Wat Tyler&#x27;s head ended up on a pike, and despite the poll tax being rolled back, serfdom as an institution remained.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldhistory.org&#x2F;Peasants&#x27;_Revolt&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldhistory.org&#x2F;Peasants&#x27;_Revolt&#x2F;</a>\n\n          <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;it.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tuchinaggio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;it.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tuchinaggio</a>\n\n          &gt; peasants armed and trained with knight-killing longbows<p>The longbow&#x27;s reputation as a hard-counter to heavy cavalry is, I think, a little context dependent. The famous set pieces like Poitiers, Agincourt, Crecy all featured favorable terrain - and in the case of Agincourt, favorable weather - ideal for massed fire into predictable funnels (where, strictly speaking, the longbow served first and foremost as a <i>horse</i> killer).<p>All this to say, it&#x27;s IMO a mischaracterization to imply the peasants in the aforementioned peasants revolt held the military edge relative to the crown and its allies. After the initial shock of the uprising, they were a clear underdog matched against a well resourced and ruthless opponent.\n\n            I agree entirely. Even with the longbow (or crossbow), a peasant uprising could maybe kill a few local lords and knights, but most of the time they would then find themselves very much the underdog against the forces that would be mobilized in response. We have to wait until gunpowder (for example Jan Zizka&#x27;s Hussites - and even that was more an exception that proves the rule) for peasants, on average, to have a decent chance.\n\n      &gt;&gt; And lastly the one I think is most likely C: AI automates all this knowledge work for the benefit of company owners and we end up either accepting it as a group and falling back to pre industrial serf like social structures or every rises up in a social revolution.<p>&gt; My counter-argument to C: (I almost typed C:\\&gt; there, sorry) is that money in tech, in the end, still comes from people. Even if your business is using AI to optimise ad targeting, those ads still get paid for because the advertisers expect humans to hand over money at some point to buy products or play games or something.<p>I think the real risk of C is that the economy changes to something <i>radically</i> different, where everything is capital and labor is (basically) no longer required. The whole B2C economy just withers and dies, and is replaced by an economy centered on elite fantasy fulfillment (e.g. Elon Musks monopolizing resources to build mega-projects for themselves, perhaps with a smallish community of human pets kept as an audience).<p>There wouldn&#x27;t be any serfs, because serfs had economic value to the medieval elites. But there may be a population of marginal people scraping by squatting and subsistence farming at the margins, hoping a mega-project doesn&#x27;t displace them.\n\n    I assume you are a programmer. In my view, if AI can do software engineering, then I don&#x27;t think <i>any</i> white collar job is safe.\n\n      Software engineering at the CTO level, sure. Coding? It’s looking like the chess versus go of jobs.<p>My bartender and ski instructors’ careers are secure. My friend whose ten year old stayed indoors for a few years to play around on REPL, less surely.\n\n        &gt; My bartender and ski instructors’ careers are secure.<p>Both of these jobs - particularly the latter but where I live also the former - rely on a heavy surplus of disposable income sloshing around the economy. Once the money stops flowing the home stills start and the ski trips stop.<p>&gt; My friend whose ten year old stayed indoors for a few years to play around on REPL, less surely.<p>The broad point you&#x27;re conveying is reasonably clear, but I&#x27;m not even sure whether you&#x27;re implying your friend is a SWE by virtue of their child tinkering with a REPL, or if you&#x27;re referring to the future job prospects of said 10 year old.\n\n          AI might not come for the ski instructors, but climate change will. Already being felt in Europe.\n\n          I don&#x27;t think ski instructors are safe from AI over the next ten years. It already seems quite feasable on indoor skiing treadmills (which are getting pretty popular for lessons), and would be enabled on actual slopes with some heads-up display and body sensors&#x2F;cameras.\n\n          So the idea is that a massive increase in productivity will reduce economic production?<p>Or is the idea that we will continue to organize our society around the ever more pointless concentration of wealth?\n\n            Are you asking me what I personally believe, or what the GP meant? I don&#x27;t want to put words in their mouth, but stating that bartending is future-proof while white collar work isn&#x27;t paints the picture of a future with more inequality and concentration of wealth rather than less.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m being overly broad in my interpretation, because they did specifically single out &quot;coding&quot; - but having personally worked both in and out of tech I don&#x27;t really see non-dev &quot;desk jobs&quot; as having any particular moat against automation (and potentially even less than devs, which admittedly means I disagree with the likes of Jensen Huang).<p>So, when programmers go - they won&#x27;t go alone. At that point it&#x27;s reasonable to ask what kind of human labor will be marketable enough to command upward-mobility salary tiers, or if the 99.9% are perpetually relegated to pouring Bezos &amp; co drinks while teaching them how to telemark [1]<p>[1] dystopia aside it would be entertaining to watch\n\n              I was making a snide remark about bizarre belief that the macroeconomic effect of increased automation will be poverty.\n\n          &gt; <i>broad point you&#x27;re conveying is reasonably clear</i><p>Let me further clarify it: winemakers, lobbyists, charismatic artists and anyone else whose job is based on relationships will also be fine. (Or folks like plumbers and electricians.)<p>The roles being automated away look like the quiet, tinkering alone genius types. First at the commodity level. But increasingly at the highest ones. The preserved jobs will be both high and low, and exist in the context of a more-productive society.\n\n            &gt; The preserved jobs will be both high and low, and exist in the context of a more-productive society.<p>A more productive society is not incompatible with extreme inequality. Unless the middle is preserved, it&#x27;s hard to see how all these winemakers and charismatic artists will find a market for their labor.\n\n              &gt; <i>more productive society is not incompatible with extreme inequality</i><p>Sure. And I don’t see why in the trades and service industry solid middle-class jobs won’t survive. I’m just commenting that, ironically, coding is turning out to be the 21st century’s auto line worker.<p>Just because software engineering is being done by AI does not apply most other jobs can, too—it’s just the impersonal ones.\n\n    What’s different from the Middle Ages is that raw food is <i>cheap</i>. A prepper can get a couple years of food for like $10k. It’s not going to be lavish eating, but it’s better than starving. So if you’re smart and you lose your job and are in the pre-singularity, but have some savings, you can stock up a few years worth of food, and ride things out. If you blow it all on DoorDash, that’s on you.<p>Where to live, now that’s another problem. Buy an RV and head out to the desert? The food won’t fit into the RV though so, uh, I dunno.<p>Uh, anyway, point is, go watch Mad Max.\n\n  “Don’t be evil” disappeared in 2018. That might be around the point that big tech companies  dropped all pretense of caring about their users.\n\n  Scott Handelman said something like you&#x27;re either building Ironman or Ultron\n\n  Or alternatively, &quot;*technology will be used to extract profit, or preferably rent, from you and constrain your agency even further than it already is.&quot;\n\n    This matches my feelings. It seems that I used to believe there would be cool and powerful tools for more and more things, but now I&#x27;m expecting recurring subscriptions on ever simpler stuff until I&#x27;m paying by the character (plus a monthly sub) to type into notepad.<p>Most likely this was always the case, just a bit bigger and obvious now. I comfort myself with the belief that the number of cool and powerful tools released under properly free licenses can only grow, even if they proportion shrinks.\n\n      No, this was not always the case. Over the last 5-15 years there has been a substantial shift in who the software on YOUR devices belong to.<p>No longer do we buy software, it’s for rent.<p>Which is why I use FreeBSD.\n\n  Most of it isn&#x27;t even made to improve human life, it was just a matter of time until people wake up they&#x27;re getting a downgraded experience to please shareholders and business owners.\n\n    I&#x27;m not that cynical, and I do think that a lot of tech has done good things for people. Even something like Facebook was <i>useful</i> at the beginning, even if that is obviously no longer the case.\n\n      Facebook can still be useful. I&#x27;m using it as a centralized portal for all local events (concerts, festivals...). Smaller events are very hard or impossible to discover or track any other way. But you have to train fb a bit, and ignore irrelevant stuff you&#x27;ll still see. But there is a value in it, at least for me.\n\n        Yeah I meant more that when it started, it was simply useful in a straightforward sense, whereas today it&#x27;s been optimized for extracting ad revenue and engagement.\n\n  I think crypto is when the wheels really fell off.\n\n  &gt; I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly when it happened, but in the last decade or so,<p>It&#x27;s not really the last decade or so. You can go back 20 years or more and find people really quite dissatisfied with tech companies like IBM and Oracle and Microsoft.<p>What really happened is that &quot;you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain&quot; came for Google and Apple and what we need is to recognize that they&#x27;re now IBM and Microsoft and we need a new Google and Apple.\n\n    Google leaned into it by removing their motto &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; when they realized it was holding them back from heretofore unseen levels of extraction^h^h^h profit.\n\n      Removing &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; was an unforced PR blunder but things like that have only symbolic effect. Nobody would care if they weren&#x27;t doing actually evil things like putting their DRM in web standards and pretending that Android is open while doing whatever they can to thwart competing services from becoming popular.<p>Notice how Apple never had a &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; to begin with. Does that mean they were always evil or that they aren&#x27;t now?\n\n  One of the other things is that all the automation appears to be extracting all the joy out of life.<p>Why paint a picture or take a photograph when AI will do it for you?<p>Why design and build an application that will solve creative problems when an AI will do it? You should just review automated PRs.<p>Rather than, why go into the asbestos removal business and destroy your lungs when we have AI to do it and you can spend your time learning the guitar?\n\n    &gt; One of the other things is that all the automation appears to be extracting all the joy out of life.<p>&gt; Why paint a picture or take a photograph when AI will do it for you?<p>Yeah the tech fetishists think everyone should be awed and happy with the &quot;beautiful&quot; pictures the &quot;AI&quot; they made can generate, and reward them with copious back-pats (nevermind the output is crap and the tech boosters like them because they have no taste), but all they actually accomplish is to turn once-enjoyable things to ash.  It&#x27;s like how you can&#x27;t even buy good quality basic clothes anymore, even if you want to, because everything is either flimsy cost-reduced crap or a Veblen good.<p>For instance, I&#x27;m starting to actively loathe header images, because they&#x27;re getting replaced with &quot;AI&quot; generated garbage that (if it grabs my attention) <i>always</i> disappoints. People used to either not not have one or at least search around for a good photo or art image or something, but now many just throw up &quot;AI&quot; generated botshit to check a box one some &quot;increase engagement&quot; guide.\n\n      &gt; I&#x27;m starting to actively loathe header images<p>Header or “hero” images were always a bad idea. With or without AI.\n\n    I&#x27;ll break out one of my favorite Douglas Adams excerpts:<p>&quot;The Electric Monk was a labour-saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder. Dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you, thus saving you the bother of washing them yourself, video recorders watched tedious television for you, thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself; Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.&quot;<p>You&#x27;ve articulated a subtle point that few (so far) are amplifying -- many of these &quot;creative things&quot; that we&#x27;re having &quot;GenAI&quot; generate for us are the sort of things <i>we want to do, for our own pleasure, even (especially?) when nobody pays us to do it</i>. Supplanting those activities via &quot;GenAI&quot; is not a &quot;win&quot;.\n\n  &gt; <i>the message coming from the tech industry</i><p>This is not the tech industries fault, but the media&#x27;s: &quot;There was a top-down decision that tech could not be covered positively, even when there was a true, newsworthy and positive story.&quot; [0]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;KelseyTuoc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1588231892792328192\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;KelseyTuoc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1588231892792328192</a>\n\n  There is a french expression that kind of describes the feeling: &quot;une fuite en avant&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;a headlong flight forward&quot;, to describe an escape from the problem by blindly rushing ever forward.<p>It seems like the fear of missing out on a possible profit has every tech-related company and their dog rush into the latest trends, without thinking about the mid to long term consequences of their choices.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is about subscription models for everything, abusive private data gathering, or, more worryingly, unrestricted AI-everything.  Their competitors might be doing it, so they have to do it preemptively.  Very  much similar to the Cold-War arms race.<p>All in all, it goes nicely hand in hand with an other expression: &quot;Après moi, le déluge&quot;, literally translating to &quot;After me, the floods&quot;, or, as we say in English:<p><pre><code>    Consequences be damned.</code></pre>\n\n  The term ludite indicates that is nothing new.<p>IMHO this is not about tech being too good tho: it&#x27;s about new tech being worse.\n\n&gt; &quot;I actually think that AI fundamentally makes us more human&quot;<p>Whether you are excited by AI or not that phase is just cringe BS and deserves all the booing, so maybe the crowd wasn&#x27;t &quot;booing ai&quot; but just booing the crappy presentation full of corp speak.\n\n  Not only is it ‘cringe BS’, it’s what we here in the UK call <i>bollocks</i>.\n\n  SXSW is full of exactly the demographic of creatives that has been against AI for innumerable reasons, not the least of which is the tendency (if not intent) of the AI industry to commoditize their work and dehumanize their craft as a means of putting as much of them out of work as possible.. they were probably booing all of it.\n\nYup. Over the last 10-15 years the innovation in tech has gone from cool tech that serves users, that improves lives, to instead legal engineering, user hostile tech and behaviour that milks users for every last drop of revenue.<p>AI might be a cool tech that can serve to make the lives of actual humans better, but it might require breaking up big tech and fostering customer centric competition to realise any benefits to society at large.\n\n&gt; Not even Apple is like Apple anymore. A similar backlash happened a few weeks ago, when Apple launched its super-high-tech virtual reality headset. The early response on social media was mockery and ridicule—something Steve Jobs never experienced.<p>I definitely remember a huge viral wave of mockery about the iPad in 2010. It was everything from stretching things and calling it &quot;innovation&quot; (as in, just a big phone), comparisons to women&#x27;s sanitary pads, you name it. Mockery of Apple and Apple fanboys was one of the peak internet memes of the time. Mocking AI is tame in comparison.\n\n  The AirPods were also roundly mocked and described as so weird looking no one would want to be seen dead wearing them when first announced.<p>A few years later, it seems like we all have them (or a very similar-looking competitor) in our ears.\n\n    What makes one mocked product succede while another fails?<p>Google Glass and its users were mocked and it was a complete failure.<p>The iPad was mocked and ended up as an underperforming division, yet still the market leader because everyone else dropped the ball really badly.<p>AirPods were mocked but they are a wild success helped of course by the removal of the 3.5 jack.\n\n      Well, Google Glass probably failed either because it didn’t work sufficiently well (the technology just wasn’t there yet) or because the purported utility it provided wasn’t actually that desirable.<p>AirPods probably succeeded because (despite the at-first weird aesthetic decisions) they turn out to be far more convenient than wired earphones and nice to use. If the battery life and the rate of charging, for example, had not been as good, I don’t think they would have taken off.<p>So I think mockery doesn’t really have anything to say about the potential success of a product; it fades rapidly anyway whether it succeeds or not. Humans get used to things <i>incredibly</i> quickly and are very adaptable. It’s both a virtue and a curse (because the other side of the coin is that we get bored quickly).<p>If I were (even) more of an Apple fanboy I might argue that AirPods succeeded because Apple knows how to make fun, decidedly non-clunky products and Google doesn’t because it’s not in that business — it sells eyeballs to advertisers whereas Apple sells beautifully crafted hardware&#x2F;software combinations to creative individuals. If Google had been first to try wireless earphones, they might have flopped and put everyone off the idea.\n\n        &gt; Well, Google Glass probably failed either because it didn’t work sufficiently well (the technology just wasn’t there yet) or because the purported utility it provided wasn’t actually that desirable.<p>&gt; AirPods probably succeeded because (despite the at-first weird aesthetic decisions) they turn out to be far more convenient than wired earphones and nice to use. If the battery life and the rate of charging, for example, had not been as good, I don’t think they would have taken off.<p>You&#x27;re missing the social aspect to the rejection of Google Glass.  IIRC the term &quot;glasshole&quot; was also a reaction to the privacy-invading aspect (little to no indication if the person is recording or not). AirPods had none of that, so if you liked how they worked, you could use them and not really bother anyone.<p>I think the Apple Vision Pro will fail for similar reasons, at least as something that people take out and about except in <i>very</i> limited circumstances. I had the additional downside over Google Glass that obscures the wearers facial expression (even despite their overwrought attempts at a technical solution).\n\n      The same thing that makes any successful product succeed. The mockery is independent of the success.\n\n        This just shows how people live in their bubbles. Are you frequently hating on products like that? It&#x27;s very likely your social bubble does too, and that&#x27;s all you hear.<p>My own social media bubble proclaimed awe and interest in the new possibilities, presented their new startup ideas and hopes.\n\n    If you&#x27;re arguing that initial criticism doesn&#x27;t meaningfully predict future potential, then I fully agree. We&#x27;ve seen this in everything from EVs to streaming services to a megacorp like Amazon : plenty of rocky if not outright lampooned beginnings.<p>However if you&#x27;re attributing widespread product adoption to the erosion of cultural conservatism towards [new thing], then I think that underplays the role of product iteration. AirPods shrank their form factor and eliminated the cigarette-butt aesthetic, EVs became highly quality competitive, Amazon expanded from being a bookstore, etc.\n\n      I wasn’t arguing that (though I agree); I was just adding a further data point to support the claim that mockery of Apple products is nothing new.<p>Sure — products evolve and potentially assume a less controversial (mockable) form, but I think most of the change is in perception. Almost all of the products we use daily would probably look completely weird if we could somehow see them for the first time out of context. I’m currently typing on a tiny little touchscreen QWERTY keyboard on a device that is ostensibly a mobile telephone; none of this makes sense when first presented but we’ve all come to accept it as being as normal as breathing air.\n\nI mean if the tech industry wanted people to like it, maybe it should treat them better?<p>We live in the smoking ruins of the world of our grandparents, and that is because, unambiguously, of industry and policy shaped by industry. Wages have stagnated. Cities have become places that are great if you have lots of money to spend and pretty hostile otherwise. Medicine has increasingly become a luxury, as has healthy food and a roof over your head. Meanwhile, in tech, the goodwill of the userbase has very rapidly and repeatedly been betrayed because capital wanted constant growth. News and media have been subsumed into a slog of ad-suffused &quot;content&quot; optimized to hook your attention. You are spied on in everything you do, supposedly to target more ads. Many new horrendous ways of abusing the labor force have been invented and then legalized by this industry<p>Now I hate telling people I study AI because SV people made a really interesting methodology into an apocalyptic cult whose adherents are often smugly dismissive of most recognizable human values in favor of a vague future that sounds like living in a video game made of vibes, and the main use case the optimization-obsessed finance-twiddlers that run the show can imagine is replacing workers in every domain, starting with artists. Why should they like this? Technology for technology&#x27;s sake is not what most people care about, and why should they when the last ten years of &quot;innovation&quot; has on balance mostly been against their interests?\n\n  &gt; and that is because, unambiguously<p>Monopoly empires driven by tax revenues.<p>&gt; new horrendous ways of abusing the labor force<p>It&#x27;s a labor market.  Monopolization destroys this too.  Judges never include this market in their rulings.<p>&gt; and why should they when the last ten years of &quot;innovation&quot; has on balance mostly been against their interests?<p>What innovation?  The last ten years have been incredibly stagnant.  GPT itself is the product of &quot;what if we just throw stupid resources at this old algorithm?&quot;<p>The desire for AI,  is to me,  a supply and demand problem,  and represents a state of extreme artificial inefficiency in the system.  Perhaps that&#x27;s what AI should really stand for.\n\n    Man I never seen someone do agreegument better. We basically are in accord on most matters of substance here<p>I find nitpicking silly, but it is traditional in the agreegument format. I will only nitpick two things:<p>1. While I did put scarequotes on &quot;innovation&quot; for a reason (it is SV&#x27;s favorite euphemism of course), it is worth noting that things like funneling money into a ridesharing app to create an entire fiefdom of &quot;gig workers&quot; to misclassify and then try to codify anti-labor policies into law by pretending to go to bat for them, or selling massive troves of data to a british analytics firm in order to steer elections toward &quot;business-friendly&quot; fascist demagogues, or creating a &quot;non-profit&quot; to make &quot;safe and open&quot; AI then partnering up with one of the most consumer-hostile and closed-source companies to ever walk the earth once a good opportunity to make bank popped up are certainly uh... creative<p>2. While a lot of progress in AI recently can definitely be summarized at a high level as throwing massive datasets and parallel processors at neural networks, if you zoom in there are definitely different algorithms coming through the noise, new kinds of network layers, training protocols, and objectives that we didn&#x27;t have when ANNs first showed up. Like most actual real world science, it was a world of incremental progress that occasionally spawned a really useful application. I still think some advances in machine learning that have come out of all this nonsense have been meaningful and potentially useful, but it&#x27;s difficult to separate signal from noise when the industry brain-drains academia to do research behind closed doors on whatever sci-fi shows up in the molochian wet dreams of the capitalist investor class\n\n  &gt; We live in the smoking ruins of the world of our grandparents<p>Wait, what?<p>My grandparents lived through a war and a famine, and came of age when over half the world lived in extreme poverty.<p>I don&#x27;t think you fully appreciate how little of the world population could poo into a toilet not that many decades ago.\n\n    Many commenters here are older than me and have older parents. I forget because many are also younger than me and my parents are now grandparents. I&#x27;ll be more specific: The post-WW2 economic boom (That is, roughly 75-80 years ago) was full of promise and prosperity for a growing middle class. We got a lot of technological progress and even political will toward egalitarian attitudes out of that, but the economic situation has taken a turn toward oligarchy since about the 70s (That is, 50ish years ago), and this has essentially destroyed this middle-class prosperity, while also capturing technological progress and grinding a lot of it to a crawl, focusing mostly on dystopian applications. That&#x27;s why the crowd at sxsw boos at tech people talking about AI\n\n      You said “smoking ruins” and you said “world”. Actually you meant “in my super rich country, the middle class used to have better future prospects than now”. Meanwhile, most of the world has substantially better prospects now than in the 60s. And, depending on where you live, the same may well hold for a large lower class as well (eg black people in the US, who now get to pick any bus seat they want).<p>Things only got worse if you exclude everybody who didn’t already have it super good.\n\n        Yea, &quot;world&quot; is often used in pretty drastically different senses, like we might mean an everett branch, the continuity of a fictional universe, or, as here, the experiential reality of a person or group of people. Their context.<p>I have little granular information about the economic and political policies of most of the world, and will not claim to. I can mostly only talk about the US, where I live, though to be fair, this article is about a US festival wherein US industries got booed. Also, while it&#x27;s great that we have ended the most obvious forms of nominal discrimination against racial minorities, there are a lot of thinly-veiled ways in which discrimination is still rampant, and trends like the decline of labor power and the automation of various decisions actually exacerbate these\n\nSure, people hate tech. And tech clearly hates its own customers. So why hasn&#x27;t something that doesn&#x27;t hate its own customers disrupted tech? If anything, the enshittification is just getting worse. Prime video&#x27;s random ads alone should have led to mass cancellations but it&#x27;s not happening, is it? So what exactly will lead to people walking away as opposed to grumbling as things keep getting worse and worse?<p>Reminds me a lot of politics in the United States at this point: stuck with two disappointing parties with almost no chance of a third party really shaking things up because the one thing they can agree on is that a third party should never arise.\n\n  If tech and the customers hate each other, they wouldn&#x27;t be making revenue. Of course, there&#x27;s a couple of exceptions (e.g. monopolies, addictions) but that doesn&#x27;t really describe AI for example.<p>I think the answer is that people simply do like the tech. We voluntarily use social media platforms (nosurfing is possible), and the average person clearly finds great use in ChatGPT, MidJourney, Character and AI in general.<p>Essentially -- the complaining doesn&#x27;t represent what the market (the people) actually want. It&#x27;s controversial for sure but the willing customer base is large enough.\n\n<i>&gt; the audience booed louder when the word disrupted was used as a term of praise</i><p>Yeah, it is often goes like &quot;lets disrupt and see if we will be able to rip some benefits from the chaos after the disruption&quot;. And the fun thing that potential disrupters seem to believe that it is good for all, not only for them and only conditionally.\n\n  The original use of &quot;disrupt&quot; was in the sense of, we&#x27;re going to disrupt these porky record labels and rotten taxi medallion cartels. This got a bad reputation for two reasons.<p>The first is that the industries being disrupted were the bad guys, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they liked it. And because they were the bad guys, they couldn&#x27;t just come out and say &quot;Uber sucks because we don&#x27;t like having competition&quot;. So what they do instead is turn over every rock looking for something to blame them for in the hopes they can get the government to thrash them hard enough to make the market uncompetitive again. Which, of course, damages those companies&#x27; reputations, as was the intention.<p>The second is that a lot of the companies that used to go on about disrupting things are now the incumbents in need of being disrupted, e.g. mobile app stores and big social networks. People look at them as the bad guys because they are, but the problem there is not that disruption is bad, it&#x27;s that the gander should get what came to the goose.\n\nPeople are fed up with grift.<p>There are two types of grift - pure cynical (crypto, vr, ai influencing &amp; fake products)<p>- make me a medical system that I know can never get approved<p>- make me a business that will never ship a thing but get daddies tax bill halved<p>- make me code assistants that don&#x27;t actually help<p>and pure mean: products that are exploitative or knowingly unethical.<p>- make me a mental health chatbot without giving a shit that it tells people to kill themselves<p>- make me camera that records other people and tells me their weaknesses<p>- make me kill bots that will stop protestors from saying stuff my boss doesn&#x27;t want to hear<p>I think that people are really sick of grifters. I know I am.\n\n  Nailed it.<p>The benefits are overstated and the negatives are sold as benefits.\n\n  Definitely. I wish there was a stronger and more efficient way to call out scammers of global caliber. A system which bans Elon Musk from ever speaking about self-driving cars sounds somewhat oppressive, but I would be inclined to give it a try since what we have now seems harmful and exploitative.\n\nOne has to wonder wether those same people also boo when pundits praise advanced automation in factories. Feels like they suddenly discover luddism when the automation is coming into their own backyard.\n\n  &gt; Feels like they suddenly discover luddism when the automation is coming into their own backyard.<p>Sounds to me like you&#x27;re describing a broadly universal human trait. I for one certainly can&#x27;t claim with a straight face to always place the concerns of others on a fully level footing with my own. Can you?\n\n    Nope. Guilty as charged guv. Admittedly one of the drivers that got my naive 15 yo interested in AI in the early 80&#x27;s was the hope of eliminating the need for &#x27;work&#x27;  and tbh, especially my own future work (not AI, as that would be my hobby). :)\n\nTo anyone interested, I deeply (no pun intended) recommend reading this essay which goes back in time in order to pinpoint the reasons we are all stranded.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arturoduran.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-era-of-the-tyrant-individual-the-end-of-our-common-world&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arturoduran.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-era-of-the-tyrant-ind...</a>\n\n  Thanks so much for sharing this resource!

I hope you this can be of any value.\n\n      Sorry about the delayed ack, but Many Thanks for sharing those pointers!\n\nCan someone please elaborate upon this:<p>&gt; If the current tech leaders can’t figure this out, they will be wiped away by history—that’s happened before, and will happen again.<p>When has this happened in history, to who, and what was the context? The examples I can think of were mostly related to technological advancements (mainframe to minicomputer, for example), and not related to general public anger.\n\n  Vive la révolution française!\n\nI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that people fear that AI will make everyone live in luxury while the machines do all of the hard work, it&#x27;s that people realize that LLM&#x27;s and ML models have enough limitation and caveats to be of limited value outside of a few niche&#x27;s where they are treated as statistical models and not &quot;The AI Revolution&quot;.<p>The last 2 decades have seen a stagnation at the front end of technology and while this have led to a commodification it&#x27;s also demonstrated that web 2.0 and crypto was mostly grifts by companies and organizations that don&#x27;t really have an usefull vision. so as the web 2.0 revolution that originally inspired people at conferences like SXSW turned into an dystopia in the hands of companies like Twitter, Facebook and google, new grifts are going to get a whole lot more scrutiny going forwards.\n\nI think the author might be mixing the tech with the capitalist model that governs tech nowadays. All new innovations eventually get corrupted by the need of making the shareholders happy and that’s the danger here with AI.<p>Not saying we should go full socialism here but there might be a smarter way of giving incentives (and punishments) to companies so that we can reach an equilibrium of all stakeholders interests (including the shareholders of course).<p>Otherwise there is no good intentioned (don’t be evil) tech&#x2F;AI that will resist the ruthless capital markets.\n\nMuch tech _is_ getting worse. Particularly AI, much is about cheaply making a bot that works x% of the time, it&#x27;s cheaper to piss off a few customers and pay no-one, than to do a good job.<p>No one likes that, it&#x27;s cheap and nasty hackery.<p>People like tech that works 100% of the time, and keeps doing it.\nStuff that could not be done before that can now.<p>People don&#x27;t like churn.\nConstant upgrades.\nBuilt in obscelecense.\nAI that work 95% at best.\nMaps that make different decisions each time.\nUI fads.\nFramework wars. \nGoogle buying and killing services. \nClis that are not automatable.<p>&quot;The only thing that is constant is the rate of chane&quot; is an observation that tech is not providing what was promised: automation.<p>Cheaper nastier flakey versions of what worked fine should get a boo.\n\nGo back and watch the old MCI amd AT&amp;T ads from the early 90s at the dawn of the web. They had an optimism that feels false coming from Apple &amp; Google &amp; all the others now. We know better now that they&#x27;re interested in money and market share more than benefits to people&#x27;s lives. The latter is an incidental reason to achieve the former. It was that way back then too, but it feels more blatant now.\n\nI urge everyone to take some time out to read some of the comments on this post.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.honest-broker.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;they-praised-ai-at-sxswand-the-audience&#x2F;comments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.honest-broker.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;they-praised-ai-at-sxswand-t...</a><p>Some really interesting perspectives in the comments."

There&#x27;s speculation that Nintendo had the goods on them, and that discovery would expose them to more than the civil penalties they were facing.<p>Nintendo has never been friendly to emulation, or most fan content in general, but there are protections for fair-use and this team appears to be building their work behind those, rather than playing fast and loose with them.\n\n    Yeahw if they used leaked games to optimize the emulator for release day, they would have much more to fear.\n\n    My understanding was that they were offering a specially-patched version of Yuzu to their Patreon supporters, that included improvements for games that _weren&#x27;t released yet_.<p>*Making money* by helping people run Zelda _before it came out_ was begging for trouble.<p>Nintendo&#x27;s approach to fan projects and emulators is ridiculous, don&#x27;t get me wrong — but Yuzu authors were definitely playing with fire and overstepping what&#x27;s generally accepted in the community.\n\n      This was a widely spread myth, now generally considered incorrect.<p>Yuzu did not offer improvements before launch day. There were badly patched unofficial versions that were trying. Nintendo does allege though that Yuzu was doing research to develop the patches before launch day.\n\n        Thank you for the correction!\n\n    There are fair-use protections, but it costs money to defend. Part of why so many Smash tournaments folded in 2022 was because of Nintendo telling people they weren&#x27;t allowed to host tourneys using their IP. Granted I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but people gathering to play a multiplayer game and then streaming the matches doesn&#x27;t inherently constitute any infringement on Nintendo&#x27;s rights or ability to make money. Many TOs (tournament organizers) left the scene or stopped featuring Smash as a title over the C&amp;D notice. No one wanted to take on Nintendo in court.<p>Kind of. Some TOs are calling Nintendo&#x27;s bluff. Nintendo released a set of guidelines[0] on what kinds of tournaments can be hosted. However, Collision 2024 just happened with attendees and a prize pool surpassing the guidelines.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-americas-support.nintendo.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;answers&#x2F;detail&#x2F;a_id&#x2F;63433&#x2F;~&#x2F;community-tournament-guidelines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-americas-support.nintendo.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;answers&#x2F;detail&#x2F;...</a>\n\n      Not really. Fair use does not really legally exist. It exists primarily as a defense after you’ve already been sued - which is also why there is no official codification of what fair use actually is.<p>Also, as Nintendo can argue, imagine this was a movie. Imagine it was a movie being shown on screen for two hours. That would be case closed. Now imagine it was a movie recutting competition. Again, case closed. So what makes a tourney special? In the eyes of the law, a judge might say, absolutely nothing.<p>You might argue, “well, there’s skill being applied, whereas a movie is passive.” No dice there - just because you put effort into your copyright violation is meaningless. You might argue a movie is a full work when a video game only displays a subset - but do you think you could publicly perform 30 minutes of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and be OK? Of course not.\n\n        Interesting way to put it, but I&#x27;m still not sure that quite applies. The game is a multiplayer game intended to be played with other people. Commercial endeavors change with movie viewing. It&#x27;s implied that single entity can own a single copy while charging admission to profit from their single copy of the movie. Meanwhile, movie companies (mostly) don&#x27;t care if I play _The Lord of the Rings_ in a private setting to a small audience of known people.<p>I would argue that the competitive nature of tournaments implies that the entrants all have a copy of the game along with hardware to run the game (emulation withstanding). The only thing is streaming the event. Even then, what would be the difference between streaming a tournament and streaming myself or a small group of friends playing? It doesn&#x27;t seem like that would infringe upon the core purpose of the game.\n\n          The law is fairly immune to mental gymnastics and mind games, regardless of what the dramas indicate.<p>For movies, it’s fairly simple and widely understood you are buying a license for private viewing. While there’s some room for interpretation, it goes without saying that if you are inviting strangers <i>and&#x2F;or</i> charging admission <i>and&#x2F;or</i> running advertising, you’re inviting scrutiny.<p>Also, let’s just be honest, the moment you run advertising for anything, it’s almost impossible to argue this is not a publicly available event. Public is also fairly broad - collages have to license every movie they want to show to a classroom, for example. My college paid over $2000 to Netflix for a single showing to Math Club of one movie for about 7 viewers.<p>&gt; The game is a multiplayer game intended to be played with other people<p>The law only cares about copyright. What it is, is irrelevant.<p>As for your point about how the participants must have bought the game - I don’t think that would work either. Imagine you ran your unapproved <i>Lord of the Rings</i> convention. You also had the movies playing on repeat the whole time. I don’t think arguing that “only people who have bought the movies have any interest in being here” would protect you.\n\n        &gt; Fair use does not really legally exist<p>literally in the text of the DMCA itself\n\n          No, it simply clarifies that the DMCA cannot be used to say that fair use does not exist anymore, solely in a potential copyright lawsuit, but that DMCA provision does not apply in a DMCA circumvention lawsuit.<p>This is also why this carve-out is practically useless and also does not define guidelines for fair use.\n\n      &gt; people gathering to play a multiplayer game and then streaming the matches doesn&#x27;t inherently constitute any infringement on Nintendo&#x27;s rights or ability to make money.<p>Esports and tourneys in general generate a decent amount of money, are recurring and control a decent chunk of the narrative around games affecting their marketing.<p>Not trying to defend Nintendo or any other company, but their objective as a profit-driven organisation is to generate maximum profits.\n\n      These are just easy pickings for Nintendo to bully.  When they go after Twitch is when the real case law will be made.<p>I honestly think game streaming is a grey area that could easily be made illegal by the wrong company getting sued for it.\n\n    Beyond speculation. Nintendo is known to not fuck around, thanks to its leaks.<p>In one of the various Nintendo leaks in the past few years was a bunch of documentation of &quot;Operation Belgian Waffle&quot;, their attempt to &quot;Knock and Talk&quot; with a private investigator, law enforcement, and Nintendo Legal visiting a fairly well-known hacker in the scene. All of this was being spearheaded and commanded by Nintendo of Japan towards the subsidiaries in other countries.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torrentfreak.com&#x2F;nintendo-conducted-invasive-surveillance-operation-against-homebrew-hacker-201223&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torrentfreak.com&#x2F;nintendo-conducted-invasive-surveil...</a><p>Nintendo was already operating inside the Discord as per screenshots of evidence in the case, so they really had some leverage here.\n\n    Notably, Japan has no fair use laws.\n\n    How come Satoshi Nakamoto can remain anonymous in spite of his worth in the billions of dollars, but emulator developers, worth almost nothing, can&#x27;t hide from Nintendo?  Opsec mistakes, or just no opsec at all?\n\n      There are tons of people involved in piracy that stay anonymous. It seems like they chose not to.\n\n      .. because emulator developers are real?\n\n    My impression of the Yuzu team is that they didn&#x27;t keep a very clean house. While the project didn&#x27;t officially condone piracy, some members of the team were absolutely willing to help people run pirated games. Add to that the fact that they were emulating a current system, and that they ran a very successful Patreon to pay their team, and I think they eroded their plausible deniability down to nothing.<p>Consider that Nintendo leaves Dolphin more-or-less alone. I think Nintendo understands where emulation sits legally, and they went after Yuzu because of what was happening around the emulator, and not because of the emulator itself.\n\n  I might be wrong, but buy a game, dump the keys, sell game?\n\n    The keys are in the console, not the games.\n\n      Also, every single switch related thing has a unique ID associated with it that&#x27;s sent back to nintendo when you access the internet. e.g. consoles, controllers, docks, game carts, etc...<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of them banning a game cart yet, but it&#x27;s entirely possible.\n\n  I&#x27;m having 50,- on the fact they won&#x27;t get to May before Nintendo Legal starts cutting up their loved ones.\n\n    Yea, I wish them the best, but I would not take the other side of that bet. It’s sad that we all know it will happen and have relatively no political power to change it, despite most of us living under democratically representative governments.\n\n  Note that emulators for all(?) other Nintendo consoles remain available, and were available while the consoles were relevant. There is little Nintendo can do as long as the authors actively steer clear of guiding&#x2F;condoning piracy or guiding&#x2F;condoning certain types of DRM-bypass.<p>It was to my knowledge Yuzu&#x27;s stance on this particular matter that cost them the project, with Nintendo lawyers striking once they saw the hole in the homebrew armor.\n\n    Legally, there&#x27;s actually quite a bit Nintendo can do, there&#x27;s just always the risk of setting an undesirable precedent due to how few cases there are.<p>Yuzu&#x27;s actions just elevated the likelihood of success to near 100% instead of 80-90%.\n\n  &gt; Suyu will also require you to dump your title.keys and firmware from a hacked Switch to run games<p>It seems misleading to imply that you NEED to dump them from a real device? Can&#x27;t you just provide the files found on the internet?\n\n    Well, that would be piracy. The Suyu team condemns that behavior.<p>Edited: condones -&gt; condemns\n\n      &gt; The Suyu team condones that behavior.<p>You mean it does not?\n\n      I assume you mean <i>condemns</i> that behavior.\n\n      They <i>don&#x27;t</i> condone piracy, you mean.\n\n        Wink wink nudge nudge.\n\n      Must be nice for some people to legally hide behind words.<p>&quot;Yes, your honor. We did build this thing that some may define as a bomb capable of destroying the entire planet, but our intention was just to build a big power source. We are very much against illegal use.&quot;\n\n        Well, looks like that&#x27;s based on a true story ;)\n\n        I&#x27;m not sure we can draw a fair analogy between the nuclear arms race and software piracy. Not unless we&#x27;re starting from a premise that every law is equally just and righteous.<p>Cui bono in Nintendo having the right to tell the world that nobody is allowed to build machines that interoperate with theirs, even after they&#x27;ve sold their machine?\n\n          &quot;I&#x27;m not sure we can draw a fair analogy between the nuclear arms race and software piracy.&quot;<p>Of course not. It was just a joke. :)\n\n        If society wants to prosecute people for making emulators without any infringing content in them, then they need to make laws to make it illegal. You can&#x27;t hold people accountable to laws that don&#x27;t exist, especially when laws are amazingly over-reaching as it is\n\n        Yet, many feel that they should be permitted to take hardware the purchased and tinker with it legally. If I were to write some code that allowed me to interact with a cartridge that I bought, why shouldn&#x27;t I be able to share that code with others that might also wish to tinker with their cartridges in the same manner?<p>If you make emulation of hardware that doesn&#x27;t infringe on copyright illegal, you stamp out a lot of legal and useful tinkering.\n\n  Has the team explained their reasoning anywhere? Yuzu ostensibly already &quot;required&quot; dumping keys from a Switch console, and I don&#x27;t understand how <i>more</i> involvement of Nintendo firmware and keys lowers the risk. If anything I&#x27;d have expected a &quot;safe&quot; fork to go the other direction, position itself as a homebrew development tool, and remove explicit support for commercial games altogether (requiring e.g. a third-party tool to decrypt and unpack commercial game formats into some quasi-homebrew format).\n\n“Sue You,” as in Nintendo will…\n\n  &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Sosumi&amp;oldid=1208436801\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Sosumi&amp;oldid=1208...</a>&gt;\n\n3 things in life are certain. Death, taxes, and Nintendo emulators.\n\n  There is no 3rd without the legal problems with Nintendo.\n\n    Not sure what you mean, there are a ton of Nintendo emulators out there, some decades old.\n\n      Just a bad joke.\n\n    It only became a problem when emulator performance overtook their current-gen hardware<p>(Especially if enhanced versions of big titles like the Zelda games are intended to be a significant selling point for their next console)\n\n    I mean, Higan&#x2F;BSnes, SNES9X, Project64, Mupen64, FCEUX, mGBA, and probably dozens of others that I&#x27;m missing have been around for a very long time, and as far as I&#x27;m aware haven&#x27;t had any legal issues from Nintendo, though that might be because all of them don&#x27;t require any kind of BIOS.\n\nWhy don&#x27;t any of these major emulator teams build and release anonymously?\n\n  You can still be sued. At that point, you either:\na) defend yourself as normal, while attempting to maintain anonymity (difficult &amp; doesn&#x27;t solve anything)\nb) let the case go to default judgement (for likely an enormous amount of money) at which point Nintendo has every reason to try to track you down in real life, and can use the courts to help them do so. Hope you were really, <i>really</i> thorough about your anonymity.\n\n    How do you sue someone that is anonymous?\n\n      OpSec is hard. The Silk Road guy was anonymous, up until he wasn&#x27;t.\n\n      File a lawsuit against a John&#x2F;Jane Doe defendant(s) and describe who the defendants are, e.g., the people who code and maintain the emulator. Maybe a little harder than if you had the names but not by a lot.\n\n        I should say: the real difficulty is service, but if there&#x27;s any way to get in contact with you, there&#x27;s at least a chance it will be accepted as good service. There was famously a recent case where a defendant known only by a Bitcoin address was served by sending a transaction with an attached message to that address.\n\n  Because making an emulator takes a lot of work. And emulator devs want some compensation for this work - be it money (in form of donations) or a status that could help them gather followers or even land a job.\n\n  It can be a resume piece. Having been in these communities (server emulation instead of console) you find some insanely bright developers in them. A lot of them don&#x27;t have a formal education background, but are willing to build out well thought out pieces of software. You just have to do the research on them if they tell you this is who they are, a lot of the times you can find out plenty about how they code and design things out in the open. I&#x27;d probably almost always hire such a dev if their code seemed good, and I knew they cared about the quality of their code. Having been involved in those communities though I do know there are awful devs who don&#x27;t care about what anyone says &quot;my code aint broken&quot; types who never give credit when you help them either (reputation &#x2F; respect matters more when you&#x27;re coding for free in some of these communities).\n\n    Not making sense.<p>These anon devs can still have socials.<p>Their resume is public, and you can reach them without revealing their identity.\n\n      Do they expect a company to believe them when they say &quot;Yes, that anonymous social profile is actually me, John Emu maker. Really.&quot; Then if they proove it, by logging in and posting a known sentinel for example, do they expect everyone on that interview loop to keep their secret?<p>Companies generally don&#x27;t take anonymous credentials.\n\n        Even if the anonymous developer submitted the resume, they are giving the employer the power to dox them.  There is a lot of trust there.\n\n        You&#x27;re arguing with the parent, not me.<p>&quot;How does someone break the circularity of building a resume and staying anonymous for legal employment?&quot;\n\n      This is a little too risky since it could wind up with someone revealing their identity inadvertently or otherwise. If you truly want to be anonymous you should not be leaving so many breadcrumbs. All it takes is for a former employer to have a security breach and someone to point out that they found your real identity.\n\n        You said &quot;resume piece.&quot;<p>Now, you say any posting can reveal their identity and is too risky.<p>These are mutually exclusive.\n\n          If you&#x27;re trying to be anonymous yes, if you&#x27;re not, then it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Sometimes the reverse engineering community leans somewhere between gray and blackhat. You may not want to expose your actual identity.\n\n            We&#x27;re talking about building and releasing anonymously.<p>Your responses are talking past this.\n\n    I&#x27;ll double down on personality that parent comment pointed out.  If you see someone submit a project they worked on instead of formal education then you need to see what their exact contribution is and how they interact with other devs.  Look at past github comments, issues, etc.  Lurk in their chat server or pull logs.  Expect to see a more casual attitude than what will show up at work, but pay attention to how contributions are handled, how credit is handled, and how disagreements are handled. It&#x27;s not a universal problem, but I&#x27;ve seen some of the worst developer drama around volunteer open source video game projects.\n\n  If you want Patreonbux for your work it has to be tied to a real person (or a real legal entity which is tied to real people)\n\nIs the name intentionally a pun on sue you?\n\n  You just made it so.\n\n  The readme used to contain the text:<p>&gt; suyu, pronounced &quot;sue-you&quot; (wink wink) is the continuation of the world&#x27;s most popular, open-source, Nintendo Switch emulator, yuzu.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lineCode&#x2F;suyu-\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lineCode&#x2F;suyu-</a>\n\n    Here is a link to the commit where they changed it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;suyu-emu&#x2F;suyu&#x2F;-&#x2F;commit&#x2F;bc4f5c38fee23b8e8b7b999887cb5ebb04e8f975\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;suyu-emu&#x2F;suyu&#x2F;-&#x2F;commit&#x2F;bc4f5c38fee23b8e8b...</a>\n\n  It is. This was removed from the GitLab page 5 days ago: &quot;Removed sue-you wink wink&quot;\n\n  Reminds me of the Mac OS 7 sound “Sosumi” (so sue me!)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sosumi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sosumi</a>\n\nOn my Mac, the .dmg mounts but the executable says &quot;“suyu” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Bin.&quot;\n\n  You can usually circumvent that by right clicking (or control clicking) and pressing open. There will now be a button that says “open anyway”.\n\n  If it&#x27;s apple silicon you  need to run `xattr -cr` on the .app to get it to be executable.\n\nIf Nintendo sued Yuzu because they were indirectly causing damage, then I can sue car makers for making air polution.\n\n  You can, but to win ridiculous cases you need massively out-lawyer the defendant. It&#x27;s a lot easier for a big company to out-lawyer a handful of individuals than the other way around.\n\n    Land of the Free\n\n  That&#x27;s literally what happens though: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;sustainable-business&#x2F;german-farmers-lawsuit-against-volkswagen-demanding-tighter-carbon-emissions-2023-02-24&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;sustainable-business&#x2F;german...</a>\n\n  VW got fined for that, not enough though and many others got out scot-free for similar rigging. A handful of cars (within regulations) don&#x27;t pollute enough to cause harm but throw in thousands and thousand on narrow city roads and then do we blame the city planners?\n\nWhat&#x27;s the big fuss when we still have Ryujinx ?\n\n  I think the fear is that this is only the beginning.  Nintendo successfully killed one emulator, why would they stop there?<p>Nintendo certainly knows about Ryujinx and is patiently waiting for them to screw up <i>anything</i> legally so they can bring them down next.\n\n    Yeah I still think Ryujinx should be safe for a bit since they don&#x27;t monetize the emulator as much as Suzu did, who knows, Nintendo Lawyers are ready for anything\n\n      I suspect Ryujinx does a better job outright condemning piracy in their discourse, so there&#x27;s less for Nintendo to pounce on.\n\n  I&#x27;m sure nobody mentions it because of the fear that the mighty Nintendo might discover us Ryujinx rebels.\n\n    If 5 minutes of online research yields Ryujinx, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fairly safe bet that Nintendo are already very aware of its presence.\n\n      Yeah I think with 31k stars on github, youtube videos reaching hundreds of views..<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to assume Nintendo knows about Ryujinx haha\n\nIn some ways Nintendo suing the original project was a good thing. It brought the project to the attention of a lot more people. Now there is a new version with a bunch of bugs fixed. Who knows how many new developers will be working on it now.<p>I have to think Nintendo knew this. They had to defend what they could and did so because the original project actually seemed to be doing some sketchy stuff. They know they can&#x27;t stop everything though.\n\n  I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that if they felt that they had a case against emulation as a whole, they would have brought down the Dolphin project.  As it stands, the worst they&#x27;ve done is gotten it booted off Steam, but I can happily still download it from their website.  The Dolphin project has been around in some capacity since 2003, while the GameCube was still relevant, and had more-or-less decent Wii Emulation in 2009 as well; by all accounts in 2010 Dolphin was directly competing with &quot;real&quot; Wiis (while offering proper HD output no less).<p>I&#x27;m sure Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers were perfectly aware of Dolphin pretty early on, and if they felt that there was <i>any</i> case against them then they would have done something.\n\nIs there a definitive fork of Citra as well? That was the actual tragedy of the Yuzu aftermath.<p>I do know there are forks for Citra VR, Mac, and Android that were unaffected which is great however.\n\n  At least Citra is a mature emulator, almost 100% of\nthe games work.<p>The disaster is actually the online lobbies. Citra had a multiplayer network and it’s not\navailable anymore\n\nI would pay Nintendo the price of a physical switch console - and then each game individually - for the ability to play their games legally in top graphical fidelity using my supercomputer. I&#x27;d even be open to the idea of paying a subscription fee to do it, instead of buying individual titles, and includes back catalogue"

No clue where Ahrefs gets those numbers from.\n\n    We need high quality data to train foundational models. Many of us thought textbooks, encyclopedias, etc were a great way to start. I have a list of names of every type of encyclopedia set on eBay for that exact reason. One was Britannica.\n\nI like the idea of an encyclopaedia company being so profitable and&#x2F;or valuable\n\nI hope this funds contracting top authors for the Encyclopaedia. If you check an article&#x27;s authors, you&#x27;ll see that many are written by experts in their field (professors, high-level practicioners, etc.) and some by leading people in their field. In the past they were written by people like Einstein and Freud. And often articles by leading experts can be very engaging, written with a personality and point of view (though they seem to cover all sides).<p>But it seems like many of those authors are long retired, maybe dead, and I wonder how old their contribution is (Britannica seems to update it). And many articles say they are written by the &#x27;Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica&#x27;, though maybe that always was the case.<p>I have nothing against the editors, but an expert in that domain will have perspective, insight and current knowledge (i.e., not yet in textbooks) that is impossible to match, imho. I&#x27;d love to see them again hiring leading people to write.\n\n  Luminaries like that also have their hobby horses and grievances that may color their writing. The editors are people doing a lifelong work of curating all kinds of information, including through primary sources such as papers in peer reviewed scholarly journals, such as those written by the contributors you mention. So it stands to reason that there is a core contributed by a leader in their field at the time, which is subsequently maintained by the editors and contributors.\n\n    It would be nice to have contributions from multiple luminaries on the same topic, sometimes as collaborations\n\n      Yes, that would be great. A debate even, though that would be an odd format in an encyclopedia.<p>In Britannica the way it is now, I&#x27;ve noticed that related topics are sometimes written by experts with different viewpoints, and where they overlap you can see the contours of the terrain, so to speak.\n\n    &gt; Luminaries like that also have their hobby horses and grievances that may color their writing<p>If you look at specialist academic encyclopaedias (e.g. the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy), very often the article on theory X is written by one of the major proponents of theory X – because only they feel sufficiently motivated to write it, and because the editors think it is charitable to grant the proponent of a theory the opportunity to produce their best defence of it. But, they&#x27;ll make sure to include coverage of the criticisms of the theory, because that&#x27;s what an academic is expected to do. And the editors will make sure the article overall, and the coverage of the criticisms in particular, is fair rather than overly slanted – e.g. by recruiting one of those critics as a reviewer.\n\n    I think articles having a voice can be a desirable property. I think this makes SEP good, for example.\n\n      SEP?\n\n        Yes. I also want to know.<p>Edit. Ah!<p>Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. I read back a couple of comments and it clicked\n\n          <i>Encylopedia</i>.

Imagine an expert in CPU manufacturing having written something 15-20 years ago; the editor would have trouble making sure it was now correct and complete.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;HrwTp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;HrwTp</a>\n\nHmmm, an AI that only uses factual encyclopaedia data for its training set.<p>If they can also completely eliminate hallucinations, they could be onto something useful.\n\n  If you train a language model on a factual dataset, it will still hallucinate.\n\n    That&#x27;s why I specifically said &quot;if they can also eliminate that...&quot;.<p>Sure it won&#x27;t come from just having a good data set... they&#x27;ll need to do other stuff as well.  Hopefully not impossible. :)\n\n      One technique which reduces hallucinations, is to augment the LLM with a database of facts (such as the text of an encyclopaedia). You take the prompt, and you do a semantic search on the fact database (RAG, retrieval augmented generation) to find sentences&#x2F;paragraphs&#x2F;documents which relate to the prompt, and you add them to the prompt. Another related approach is function-calling, where instead of just doing a query based on the text of the prompt, you let the LLM analyse the prompt and come up with search terms, and then allow the LLM to do a search for the terms it has chosen. You can prompt and fine-tune the LLM to cite all its claims to the fact database.<p>Another approach that can help, is after you generate the response, you then submit the response to an LLM (even the same LLM), with a prompt to check it for errors (errors of reasoning, misrepresentation of citations, etc). Often, LLMs can do a decent job on catching their own errors, including hallucinations.<p>The more advanced an LLM is, the less likely it is to hallucinate, and the more likely it is to pick up on its own mistakes. Llama-7b hallucinates a lot more than GPT-4, and is far less likely to detect itself doing so.<p>You can&#x27;t make an LLM foolproof, but you can&#x27;t make humans foolproof either. Humans &quot;hallucinate&quot; too – e.g. students write essays with erroneous claims, cited to sources which never actually make those claims.\n\n        &gt; You can&#x27;t make an LLM foolproof ...<p>Heh, we need &quot;post-LLM&quot; AI&#x27;s then that don&#x27;t hallucinate at all. ;)\n\n        &gt; One technique which reduces hallucinations, is to augment the LLM with a database of facts (such as the text of an encyclopaedia).

You can prompt and fine-tune the LLM to cite all its claims to the fact database.<p>Note that these are really very closely related, almost to the point of being slight variations on a single technique: both are “do a search on a database and include the results in a prompt to the LLM”; they differ in one uses something outside of the LLM to calculate the search query (typically, just an embedding of the user prompt used to search a vector DB), the other prompts the LLM so that it produces an appropriate search query.\n\n          &gt; Note that these are really very closely related, almost to the point of being slight variations on a single technique: both are “do a search on a database and include the results in a prompt to the LLM”; they differ in one uses something outside of the LLM to calculate the search query (typically, just an embedding of the user prompt used to search a vector DB), the other prompts the LLM so that it produces an appropriate search query.<p>They can produce rather different results – the LLM can do a better job than just an embedding at picking out what&#x27;s truly important in the prompt, which can increase the relevance of the returned documents. I&#x27;ve seen before where a vector search returns documents which contain some similar language to the prompt but which are actually talking about something completely unrelated. LLMs are less likely to do that sort of thing, because they have a much better understanding of what&#x27;s important in the prompt and what&#x27;s just fluff&#x2F;waffle\n\n  Do you think the reason hallucinations occur in LLMs is because the training data includes the hallucination? You are very wrong. Hallucinations are not a training data problem, at least in the way you are implying.\n\n    &gt; Do you think the reason hallucinations occur in LLMs is because the training data includes the hallucination?<p>No.  What a bizarre take.  Why would anyone think that?<p>Having a training data set that&#x27;s not based on fiction sounds like it could be a useful thing.<p>If they can somehow get rid of the hallucinations too it could be good.\n\n      &gt; Why would anyone think that?<p>Sorry (not sorry) for assuming that the second sentence in your comment was related to the first.\n\n        Hmmm, I&#x27;ve just added the word &quot;also&quot; in there as it seems you&#x27;re not the only person to misunderstand what I meant.<p>Hopefully it&#x27;s clearer now. ;)\n\n  Are hallucinations really only a problem with &quot;non factual&quot; training data? Looking at all the made up library methods that ChatGPT uses in the code it produces, it made me think this is a general LLM&#x2F;GPT problem.\n\n    Yes, weirdly, often the hallucination is how I would have liked them to expose the API.\n\n      There&#x27;s a AI powered devtool in this idea somewhere\n\n    It is a fundamental problem with how gpt works.\n\n  Just because it&#x27;s printed in a book doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s any more factual than any other source of information. Many studies and reviews have found Wikipedia to be more accurate overall than Encyclopedia Britannica. In fact, because it&#x27;s in a book, it&#x27;s harder to correct, and more insidious because of opinions like the one you just expressed.<p>In both cases, you should not treat the information as canonically or authoritatively accurate or factual. Biases, gaps, outright lies and fabrication exist in any large collection of human writing.\n\n    &gt; Many studies and reviews have found Wikipedia to be more accurate overall than Encyclopedia Britannica<p>I&#x27;m not doubting this, but do you have citations?\n\n      I realize this isn&#x27;t the most unbiased source, but it does have lots of citations with studies comparing Wikipedia and Britannica.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reliability_of_Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reliability_of_Wikipedia</a>\n\n        That comment is an amazing demonstration of the intellectual failure of Internet users (as you somewhat acknowledge) and the reason Wikipedia is so popular.<p>If you know it&#x27;s heavily biased, maybe find something else?\n\n          The post I&#x27;m replying to was asking for a list of citations where Wikipedia was equally accurate to Encyclopedia Britannica. That wiki article has several of those citations (as well as Britannica&#x27;s attempted refutations).<p>I understand that you can&#x27;t read every link in a comment, but you certainly don&#x27;t have to post a comment like this if you haven&#x27;t at least looked into what I posted.\n\n            I&#x27;m not sure how that addresses the bias issue, which was what I was talking about.\n\n              I don&#x27;t think the wikipedia article is heavily biased.\n\n      <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reliability_of_Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reliability_of_Wikipedia</a>\n\n    It&#x27;s not a book; Britannica is a website now. They might sell you some books if you try, but that&#x27;s not what they are editing for or producing.<p>Britannica&#x27;s advantage is that it&#x27;s written by experts and edited by professionals. If I want knowledge - for business, for my health, for legal, accounting, car repair, IT - I ask experts.<p>There are downsides - it&#x27;s not nearly as large as Wikipedia, and it doesn&#x27;t engage the crowd. But I know someone with expertise verified the facts, and the completeness, correctness, and consistency (the three C&#x27;s of accuracy) of each article.\n\n  That will be interesting. I suspect that the hallucinations come from combining unrelated data in ways that stretch reality. However, using the general Internet as a source of Truth seems like it was never a good idea.\n\n  I took a brief look at their online article about the British empire. While it does briefly mention Jamaica requiring &quot;conquest&quot; in the origins section, it seems mostly oblivious to the consequences of the empire&#x27;s &quot;commercial ambitions&quot; for the local populations. Not sure that would form a great &quot;factual&quot; source of truth to train an AI on.\n\n  I&#x27;ve got a 20 year old set of their books in the basement. It&#x27;s got facts which were wrong at the time of writing.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s just a single centralised source\n\n  An LLM that <i>only</i> used “factual encyclopedia data” as its training set would probably be very good at producing content that looked like encyclopedia articles, but bad at anything else.<p>Probably wouldn’t be any less prone to confabulation than any other LLM, and given how limited in coverage the sum of any factual encyclopedia is compared to typical LLM training sets, would have even a spottier base of factual information that most LLM’s have to work from.<p>&gt; If they can completely eliminate hallucinations<p>Yes, but that’s orthogonal to the training set.\n\n    &gt; Yes, but that’s orthogonal to the training set.<p>Of course.  I didn&#x27;t say otherwise.<p>&gt; An LLM that  ...<p>Note that I also wrote &quot;AI&quot; rather than &quot;LLM&quot;. ;)<p>Hopefully there will be better alternatives (to LLMs) at some point that don&#x27;t hallucinate.<p>My point is that having one of those (something that doesn&#x27;t hallucinate) trained on factual data sounds like it&#x27;d be useful. :)\n\n      &gt; Hopefully there will be better alternatives (to LLMs) at some point that don’t hallucinate.<p>There are AIs that don’t “hallucinate” (a bad metaphor), e.g., most of the technologies developed in the previous rounds of AI – like expert systems.<p>I doubt that we will find <i>more advanced, equally-or-more general</i> AI techniques than LLMs that don’t “hallucinate”, what we’ll probably do is find better ways to build systems around LLMs (or more future AI architectures) that allow them to resolve “hallucination” better before presenting results.<p>It’s not as if natural intelligences don’t both literally hallucinate and, more relevant to what is described as “hallucination” in AIs, confabulate when pressed to answer without access to facts, and we know with them that grounding in physical reality via sensory data and having access to factual references doesn’t mitigate those effects (and we’ve also been able to demonstrate the latter with LLMs.)\n\n    You’re missing that you can reinforce information by repeating specific, data sets. They could use some repetitions of it to drill in the knowledge, put in a lot of content that’s less reliable in a different style, and re-run high-quality content afterwards to reinforce it.<p>The AI’s already accidentally do that for topics people repeat a lot on the Internet, esp political. ChatGPT used to fight with me over some of those. That it would not relent or stop redirecting me showed that they can be trained to follow authoritative sources, too.\n\nStrange to learn that this is a private company, I&#x27;d always assumed that the Encyclopedia Britannica was produced by the UK government, in the same vein as the CIA World Factbook.\n\n  And like Federal Moving and Storage, and National Tree Service?\n\n  Oh that&#x27;s wild. That never crossed my mind, but given the name it seems like it should have.\n\nGiven how long it&#x27;s been since EB was at the peak of its commercial and cultural import, it&#x27;s hard not to worry that this isn&#x27;t just another example of Vampire Capitalism looking for a way to enrich itself while sucking a once great company dry.\n\nIt&#x27;s a great resources almost never on SERP page 1.  I hope they invest money in good SEO b&#x2F;c there&#x27;s some much garbage out there that EB deserves more love.  And many things you look up don&#x27;t change and the article written in 1980 is better than the LLM version written in 2024.\n\n  It&#x27;s often in the top 5 or 10 at DuckDuckGo.\n\n&gt; Founded more than 250 years ago<p>I wonder what the oldest company to go public is. This isn&#x27;t easy to Google, because search engines want to give you the public company which is the oldest, even though that&#x27;s not the same thing. I see this article about Birkenstocks, which company is apparently almost 250 years old. Surprising! But it does not mention Birkenstock being the oldest company at the time of IPO, so there must be an older one.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;13&#x2F;1198324691&#x2F;birkenstock-ipo-stock-clogs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;13&#x2F;1198324691&#x2F;birkenstock-ipo-st...</a>\n\n  I&#x27;d look for a business in a trade that goes back to ancient times, is in demand today, and needs capital. Maybe something more institutional, like a academic institution? A hospital?<p>Also, I&#x27;d look in a country with both large securities markets and a long history (i.e., not the US). Maybe Japan, Italy, or France?\n\n  Hudson Bay Company was ~340 years old when it IPOd.\n\n  I don&#x27;t know if this is the answer but Fiskars is an old company, founded 1649, which is publicly listed\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fiskars\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fiskars</a>\n\n  I believe the record is 613 years, by Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB, a Swedish mining company.<p>It was founded in the 13th century as Stora Kopparberg (first record is a private stock sale in 1288). It went public on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1901.<p>Today it&#x27;s known as Stora Enso Oyi, following a merger with the Finnish company Enso in 1998.\n\nCompletely off-topic but this post made me think about those Encarta discs growing up.\n\n  I remember\n\nI fail to see how becoming beholden to stakeholders will make an encyclopaedia a better publication. A real shame. Feels like nothing is sacred anymore.\n\n  This might surprise you, but encyclopedias aren&#x27;t the most lucrative game in town.\n\n    Well, exactly?"

The non-risky way is to update the canary $date every $timeperiod and then stop updating $date after an attack. That way nothing is changed to indicate but it still becomes obvious by lack of update after $timeperiod.\n\n    Yeah, that kind of irked me with the commit. Currently (769b306) it says:<p>&gt;  this commit removes a section of the footer as we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality<p>Which... is just saying what happened? Point is to remove it without saying anything, as if you do, you&#x27;d break the &quot;requirement for confidentiality&quot; and put yourself at risk.\n\n      Imagine complying with a gag order. That&#x27;s one of the most blatant abuses of human rights.\n\n        It is. But when you&#x27;re on the receiving end and the federal agents bust down <i>your</i> door and point firearms at <i>you</i> you see things a bit differently in the moment.\n\n          Agreed, but that&#x27;s all the more reason to be louder and more defiant.\n\n            Not everyone wants to be a hero.\n\n              An hero\n\n        somehow it is hard to believe that this statement is made .. confidentiality and &quot;gag orders&quot; have ruled the business world for more than twenty years in the USA. Any executive of any public company (stocks) must demonstrate iron-clad compliance with these orders, every week of their employment.  Asvmuch as anyone might agree with the aspirational poetry of this statement, it is literally ABCs of US dollar business that this is no joke. surely that is clear?\n\n          This isn&#x27;t business. This is the government using secret violent force to keep you from telling others you&#x27;ve been (legally) robbed. It does not involve a voluntary contract that one enters into willingly in the open. These are very different things. Surely that is clear?\n\n            Exactly. This isn&#x27;t a voluntary contract\n\n            One extreme (no demand on me is fair) or the other (every action by government must be obeyed) .. neither of those..<p>I agree that it is not a contract between equals, it is an action of law in government; like it or not it is the price of civilization.  In the USA the basis of law has been worked out very well, in some cases. Of course there are abuses and no one is defending an abuse of the law.  Humans are social and difficult. The answer lies in a system of review and an ability to change over time.\n\n      A voluntary enquiry with a gag order? I mean, I suppose in principle there&#x27;s no reason such a thing wouldn&#x27;t be possible, but it feels like a bit of an edge case.\n\n        I&#x27;m trying to think to myself if I was running a project and had a canary, what would be the threshold to kill the canary on a voluntary enquiry.<p>If it was CIA and they sent me: &quot;Please give us all information on XYZ so that we can organize an assassination on them. This is voluntary and you don&#x27;t have to give us that information. This is just pretty please.&quot;<p>I think I would kill my canary even if the request is technically voluntary and I wasn&#x27;t compelled to give out any information. But that was a joke scenario because I couldn&#x27;t come up with more realistic scenarios.<p>And then I guess if your threshold is too low, you&#x27;ll kill your canary on something that might be a nothingburger.\n\n          I don&#x27;t think the CIA exactly sends you a note asking for data to be dropped off at their Google Drive. It is more likely you receive an offer to license data you have from a company that is relatively obscure with a financial incentive.\n\n  The idea behind a canary is while they can tell you to keep it confidential, they can&#x27;t compel your speech to lie and say you&#x27;ve never cooperated.  Adding a <i>wink wink nod nod</i> code word defeats the idea.\n\n    Isn&#x27;t saying &quot;You can&#x27;t talk about this&quot; compelling speech? Why can the courts say &quot;You can&#x27;t talk about this&quot; legally, but can&#x27;t say &quot;You can&#x27;t update your warrant canary&quot;?\n\n      Because, in the United States, you have a constitutional right not to be compelled to say something you don&#x27;t want to, but you don&#x27;t have the constitutional right to say whatever you want to, especially in the case of a gag order regarding an active investigation or trial.<p>So if you go ahead and say &quot;I haven&#x27;t be served a warrant by X group&quot; on your website, the government can stop you from saying the contrary, but they can&#x27;t force you to lie about it, so you are free to remove the canary since it is no longer true.<p>If the courts ever tried to retaliate against that, they&#x27;d run into a mountain of precedent that forbids compelled speech. They would have to argue that you are required to lie, rather than be allowed to retract a non-truth. That&#x27;s not something the Constitution is going to allow.\n\n        So, it goes like this? If I have been served a warrant with a gag order:<p>If someone asks me &quot;Have you been served a warrant with a gag order?&quot; - I&#x27;m allowed to say &quot;No&quot;, and lie about it if I want to. I am <i>not</i> allowed to say &quot;Yes&quot;, per the gag order.<p>Now, if someone asks me: &quot;have you been served a warrant with a gag order? Say no if the answer is no, but say nothing is the answer is yes&quot;. Now, I am allowed to say no, and allowed to say nothing, even though by saying nothing it directly contradicts the point of the gag order? Is it really the case that these gag orders are meaningless if someone just asks the question in the right manner?<p>I can&#x27;t really buy that. I suspect canary warrants only &quot;work&quot; because they have never been tested in court yet.\n\n          Expiring signatures... No one can force you (legally) to renew the signature.\n\n            I suspect a judge could compel you to do so, in the same sense that they can compel you to not divulge that you received a warrant.<p>But, I guess we won&#x27;t really know until a warrant canary event makes its way to the courts.\n\n              a judge can compel you to do cryptographic math in your head after you have forgotten the private key? the entirety of reaching into peoples minds with law is nonsense\n\n                Well, a judge kept Tommy Thompson in jail for 7+ years on contempt of court charges after the court asked Tommy to product some gold ingots and he &quot;forgot&quot; where they were.\n\n          &gt;If someone asks me &quot;Have you been served a warrant with a gag order?&quot; - I&#x27;m allowed to say &quot;No&quot;, and lie about it if I want to. I am not allowed to say &quot;Yes&quot;, per the gag order.<p>&gt;Now, if someone asks me: &quot;have you been served a warrant with a gag order? Say no if the answer is no, but say nothing is the answer is yes&quot;. Now, I am allowed to say no, and allowed to say nothing, even though by saying nothing it directly contradicts the point of the gag order? Is it really the case that these gag orders are meaningless if someone just asks the question in the right manner?<p>It isn&#x27;t about asking or answering questions.  Let&#x27;s say I light a fire in my firepit each morning that I haven&#x27;t been served with a secret warrant.  The day after I&#x27;m served, I simply don&#x27;t light it.  Anyone watching the firepit then knows that I&#x27;ve been served.  Nobody is asking me anything, and I&#x27;m not saying anything.  The government can compel you to stay silent due to a gag order, but they cannot compel you to trudge out every morning to light the firepit.\n\n        The other half is that the canary is broad, and doesn&#x27;t specify which government or agency made the request &#x2F; gag order.<p>The &quot;I didn&#x27;t really talk about it, I just didn&#x27;t NOT say I WASN&#x27;T talking about it&quot; thing feels like a flimsy technicality. I think what&#x27;s really protecting these canaries is that they&#x27;re non-specific and one-time-only.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to see many &quot;I have not been gagged by the CIA on April 25, 2024&quot; canaries going around, even though that technically uses the same loophole.\n\n      As I understand it warrant canaries are controversial in the legal community or at least were last I looked.  Some of the questions you are exactly what they&#x27;ve asked.  I don&#x27;t know if any of the theories have been properly tested in courts yet.<p>I&#x27;d be extremely skeptical of anything you read in this thread about contentious signing, dates or whateever. There are a lot of amateur lawyers with amateur opinions in here.  If you are interested in ever using one, find a lawyer and check with them first.<p>But whatever the legal consensus is, I doubt a git commit that says &quot;NSA wuz here&quot; fits in with it.\n\nIf you can just say in a commit message &quot;we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality&quot; surely the whole song and dance about canaries is pointless, right? Or did the committer fuck up and ruin their plausible deniability?\n\n  I was really surprised to see that commit message.  I wonder if they had that cleared?  I&#x27;m guessing the committer didn&#x27;t fully understand the concept.\n\n  I guess they figure they can say they&#x27;ve received the inquiry, but can&#x27;t say what the inquiry is about.\n\n    But then as the parent poster mentioned, what&#x27;s the point of the whole canary concept\n\n      My cynical side wonders if they were just looking for an excuse to get rid of it so they can continue their process of sheding off the final remaining shreds of the original cypherpunk culture of crypto.\n\n      They might have anticipated receiving a more restrictive gag order when they originally put the canary in place.<p>I wonder if the NSA should have a team that just goes around organisations that have warrant canaries and sends them baseless confidential messages, just enough to trigger the canary. The fact that they don&#x27;t do this suggests they don&#x27;t think canaries are much use.\n\n        Most organizations which post warrant canaries use phrasing that would be less vulnerable to this &quot;attack&quot;, such as making the canary conditional on the <i>compelled disclosure</i> of information.\n\n  I think anyone can still say they they have NOT been contacted by a given agency?<p>That given, they are not going to &quot;waste&quot; their canary if it was a simple request for information. Best guess, this is the beginning of the end for Ethereum and they have been compromised just like Blockstream and BitcoinCore were previously.<p>It is best to assume that from now on Ethereum is no long a decentralized application but its development is being directed by a governmental agency, again, same as BitcoinCore.<p>Most important next step for Cryptocurrency is to make it development resistance. Every notable attack on crypo the last few years has not been hackers but developers like Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd and Adam Back who attack the code base out in the open, acting as useful idiots for three letter organizations. It seems ETH is next on the chopping block.\n\n    Ethereum (the protocol) is not only developed by Ethereum Foundation; and further, the several client implementations are all open source and run by independent organizations.<p>Seems like wild speculation.\n\n    Selectively choosing to not trigger a warrent canary defeats it&#x27;s intended purpose - to communicate when you receive a gag order.\n\n  This losing the whole point of a canary reminds me of Dr. Strangelove&#x27;s quote<p>&gt; Of course, the whole point of a Doomsday Machine is lost, if you <i>keep</i> it a <i>secret</i>! Why didn&#x27;t you tell the world, EH?\n\n    This is an absolutely unbelievable Baader-Meinhoff coincidence. I was, less than 5 minutes ago, searching the script for this line so that I could send it to my father.<p>As proof, this is the only line returned when you search the text for the string &quot;tell the&quot;. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nd.edu&#x2F;~dlindley&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;DrS.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nd.edu&#x2F;~dlindley&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;DrS.htm</a>\n\n  Or they were just giving a finger to The Man.  But yes, to the extent that a &quot;we have never&quot; canary would have protected them (which is a little questionable to be honest), this commit message taken alone absolutely opens them up to whatever penalties exist in whatever jurisdiction sent the demand.\n\nHow weird is it that the ethereum foundation repo (one of) has only 2 stars?\n\n  The &quot;bigger&quot;&#x2F;more extensive website is ethereum.org (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;ethereum-org-website\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;ethereum-org-website</a>), guess people aren&#x27;t as interested in the foundation as they are in the project itself. I think that&#x27;s pretty standard in the cryptocurrency scene.\n\n    Even more relevant would be the Ethereum Improvement Proposal repo (where people submit proposals to change the spec):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;EIPs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;EIPs</a><p>Or the go-ethereum execution client (the most popular execution client):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;go-ethereum\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;go-ethereum</a>\n\n  That partially explains why nobody noticed the change being made 2 weeks ago.\n\nProbably a complete coincidence but it&#x27;s interesting that the commit included lots of irrelevant formatting changes too.\n\nRemember not to mix formatting changes into commits with semantic changes. :)\n\n  It&#x27;s a good rule of thumb, but it also feels like people use that as a tactic to continually change code to get away from having a formatting change come in. That&#x27;s why on any new project, even personal ones, I enforce formatting from day one if the language has a formatter.<p>It&#x27;s pretty annoying to work in a codebase that had no formmatter running so that I then have to make special adjustments to my editor to stop formatting on save for certain files.\n\n    I don&#x27;t understand your point... how would continually changing code avoid formatting changes? If you want to change the formatting, just commit a change to the formatting.\n\n      If you&#x27;re making a big commit that formats a large file or files and those files are constantly getting merged in, then it makes the formatting PR hard to get in as it constantly has to merge or just start over. This might be only a concern for certain scenarios in large companies.\n\n      Because your change and the formatting change are probably dependent, and between the time you submit the change and the time your PRs are accepted there may be multiple other commits to that file which affected lines that your formatting PR addressed.  If changes wait for weeks to be merged (which is actually pretty quick compared to years) you wind up with the formatting change being blocked on needing a rebase.  The thing becomes an annoying PITA of merge conflicts and rebases.<p>So either have code formatting standards to start with which are automatically applied, or else accept PRs that have whitespace fixes and merge them promptly (I can accept splitting up the commits into formatting and non-formatting commits but even that is barrier to entry over people being able to submit changes to your software easily--every bit of fussiness is a tax on the submitter&#x27;s time and will result in less submissions).\n\n        You make it sound like both of these changes have to be entirely separately reviewed, but most of the code review processes I have seen--including mailing lists--have the ability to merge in a sequence of patches in a single go, rather than having to review each one by one.<p>Otherwise, if the problem is that you have patches waiting to be merged for weeks that result in merge conflicts, that isn&#x27;t solved by putting the patches together into a single patch: you just have a process that is going to make formatting changes impossible to clear without tons of extra work.<p>As for submitters, they need not put in this time: the maintainer or review team can trivially split the patch as this is literally close to hunk selection... it is so easy that I routinely do this as part of every single commit I have made even locally and even temporarily for as long as I can remember?<p>Regardless, I still don&#x27;t understand: nothing you are saying makes it sound like the people in your scenario are actively making code changes to <i>avoid</i> having to make a formatting change--&quot;a tactic to continually change code to get away from having a formatting change come in--which is what was claimed and what seemed so utterly confusing... I can&#x27;t imagine someone saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to change this logic few days as I hate formatting patches&quot;.\n\n          You&#x27;re assuming a relatively high degree of competency and available time on the part of maintainers and it sounds like a reasonably short backlog.  That&#x27;s great.  For overworked, understaffed teams like a large backlog of reviews it generally doesn&#x27;t work like that.  And for those teams the work done on fixing the formatting issues across their project pays off in velocity because submitters and reviewers stop needing to care about the issue entirely.<p>This is why when people think about submitting a change and they see their editor auto-formatting changed half the lines in the file with whitespace fixes, they get a bad feeling about how submitting anything to the project is going to go.\n\n      &gt; how would continually changing code avoid formatting changes?<p>It makes every single commit as ugly as this one.  In other words, instead of only some of your commits being full of formatting noise, all of them are, because touching any line causes rewrapping&#x2F;reindentation of all the nearby lines.<p>Running a formatter on <i>every single commit</i> is dumb, unless you&#x27;re an enormous company that doesn&#x27;t release their software (i.e. Google and very few other companies).<p>If you ship your software, make the autoformatter part of the release process.  Commit the reformat (to the trunk) right before each branch-off.  It&#x27;s a great compromise.  Everything is autoformatted &quot;in the limit&quot; but the disruptive commits happen only once per release cycle.  Formatting-only PRs get rejected with &quot;please wait until the next release and&#x2F;or teach the autoformatter to do whatever it is you want here&quot;\n\n  I like to bundle those in a separate commit at least.\n\n  Right! What a mess of a commit\n\n    Look they used prettier on this css file how convenient\n\n  I used to believe this but then I found myself spending way more time on clean single-purpose commits than I saved looking at a clean commit log.<p>Especially if the cleanup touches the same code you are semantically modifying you are basically forced into a bad dilemma of doing them in parallel (leading to a merge conflict with yourself yuck), or doing them in series which leads to the question of whether you should twiddle your thumbs while waiting for the first commit to get through review or whether you should do something else in the meantime risking forgetting the other commit.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely clear cut.\n\nWhat are the implications for a warrent to be served to the ethereum foundation? Unlike the last time[0], this is directed at the foundation rather than individual.<p>[0]: In 2019, Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea. He would later plead guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in 2021.

If the whole point is that you&#x27;re continually posting a &quot;no&quot; and you suddenly stop, that makes sense legally because it seems strange that you could coerce someone to keep doing something and lying, as that is not the same thing as &quot;disclosing&quot; something. Like, if you wore a green shirt every day and suddenly started wearing red, it makes sense to me why legally it would be hard to force someone to keep wearing green shirts.<p>This is nothing like that, the commit message itself is <i>literally</i> disclosing the fact that they have received an enquiry.\n\nI&#x27;m always anti-canary.  Two scenarios:<p>* You&#x27;re suddenly under governmental orders not to disclose X.  You remove a canary that says not-X, effectively disclosing X, and this was obviously your exact and pre-meditated intent.  You then have to find a lawyer who will help you argue to a judge and other officials that you&#x27;re in the clear with this loophole.<p>* You have a canary that says not-X, as an assurance to some other party.  X happens, but you&#x27;re also told at the same time that the folk wisdom you heard on the Internet about canaries will not protect you.  So you don&#x27;t remove the canary.  Now your canary is falsely assuring that other party, betraying whatever trust they put in you, perhaps to their detriment.\n\n  This is why you sign the canary regularly, and then it just expires if you do nothing.<p>Although... I also don&#x27;t see much use in them either, it seems everyone ends up complying with something eventually and so all canaries end up getting removed.\n\n    That doesn’t seem functionally different than removing the canary.\n\n      Things break all the time! Usually they get fixed, but sometimes you&#x27;re just too busy to get around to it.\n\n      Removing the canary requires action. Not resigning a canary requires inaction.\n\n        I strongly doubt a judge will care to distinguish the two.\n\n          that would be compelled speech\n\n          Doubt all you want.  Can you point to case law?\n\n          <i>Why did you do this thing 2 weeks ago?</i><p>vs<p><i>Why didn’t you do this thing 2 weeks ago that you were under no legal obligation to do?</i><p>Seems like a significant and valid distinction even if what they communicate to the intended audience is largely the same.<p>“Largely the same” because in the second case it would be possible that forgetting, or some other obstacle to resigning occurred.\n\n      That sounds like much more of a nuanced law question than a &quot;are these the same&quot;.\nWhile they might be able to stop you telling the world, they might not be able to force you to perform actions that cause you to lie to the public\n\n      Not a lawyer, but I think the government has more ability to prevent you from doing something than forcing you to act. \nThey can tell you to not remove the canary, and not tell anyone your logs are being monitored, but it is trickier for them to say you must re-sign this certificate.\n\n    IANAL, but I&#x27;d think that hurting your possible future defense is what you just said, and what people always say: that the premeditated intent is to violate a potential future gag, and that removing the canary (or not updating a cryptographic signature, or resetting to 0 the &quot;__ days since last served a subpoena&quot; notice) is a mechanism for that violation.<p>IMHO, that&#x27;s kinda a weaselly trick, no matter how good the cause, and it might not stand up, not legally, nor in extra-legal practice.\n\n  Doing it with HTML, CSS, and an SVG icon seems odd. Having it in your privacy policy document or something similar seems more appropriate then you&#x27;re just updating your privacy policy.\n\n  In this case, they mentioned the involvement of a confidential state agency in the commit message, so it does not seem like there is a gag order <i>per se</i>, at least not a very broad one.<p>And to my knowledge, warrant canaries haven&#x27;t been tested in U.S. courts, so the zeroth (and possibly most common) scenario would just be that you remove the canary and nothing happens to you, and the canary works as intended.\n\n  I know a little something about these kind of mechanisms.<p>Neither of your scenarios seem problematic:<p>&quot;You then have to find a lawyer who will help you argue to a judge and other officials that you&#x27;re in the clear with this loophole.&quot;<p>Presumably the same lawyer(s) you&#x27;ve already retained for the purpose of defending the canary (and other things).  Defending the canary in court (under US 1A law regime) <i>is the entire point</i>.<p>Also note that in the <i>de facto standard</i> canary process[1] you don&#x27;t remove the canary (as that would be a positive, intentional act of speech).  You simply stop updating it.<p>&quot;So you don&#x27;t remove the canary.&quot;<p>Again, under no scenario do you remove the canary - you simply stop updating it.<p>[1] &quot;Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page.&quot;\n\n    Something I don&#x27;t understand...<p>I imagine that canary questions sometimes come up in non-publicly-disclosed legal proceedings, as well as in the occasional extra-legal practice.<p>If that actually does happen, and canaries ever failed to stand up in them, then how many lawyers would ever be in a position to hear about those failures, such that the lawyer could competently advise clients how to use canaries successfully?<p>Would the lawyer have to have been the veteran top litigator who handled the situations that reached the ear of the ACLU, or who previously worked on those situations on behalf of some facet of government?<p>Or is there sufficiently binding official assurance from government that canaries done a certain way are OK, no matter what happens in some non-public meeting?<p>(BTW, I really like your company.  Though, as much as its canary looked like probably a signal of principled old-school Internet techie values, it also looked like potentially a bit of a magnet for trouble, in business it might attract, and in who it might antagonize.  The tech choices there seem be heavy on minimizing risk of IT drama, but the canary seemed to flirt with drama.)\n\n      &gt; veteran top litigator who handled the situations that reached the ear of the ACLU<p>I think you assume that getting in contact with lawyers from the ACLU is much much harder than it is, either that or that the ACLU only gets involved in sufficiently high-profile cases but nonetheless false. If you&#x27;re a company that deals with sensitive data and have a legitimate worry about getting NSLs you could probably get a meeting with the relevant legal&#x2F;policy expert just by shooting them a polite email about it.<p>Experts in a particular niche field <i>not</i> wanting to talk about their passion, impossible challenge. &quot;Wait, woah, you also care about this?! You wanna testify in the committee hearing for the bill our team is working on?&quot;\n\n        I agree that getting in contact with the ACLU is easy.  (I did it myself, when I was just a random city committee volunteer, and we were considering an issue that I figured the ACLU could help inform.)<p>My question was where would someone go to get counsel about canaries, from someone who knows how this actually works in practice, not only in the legal precedents that are public info.  (After all, we are talking about situations involving gags.)<p>For example, I was guessing maybe there&#x27;s someone at the ACLU who has heard of enough of the non-public to give good counsel.  But asking.<p>Unstated, I was also wondering whether the folk wisdom that so many people repeat, and which some seem to rely upon, is informed by the expertise of the rare people in a position to know the full reality.<p>Even if it&#x27;s true, it does sound like a stereotypical computer person&#x27;s misunderstanding of how law works: &quot;Aha!  But this Constitutional interpretation says that government can&#x27;t compel speech!  Checkmate!&quot;  Hence, checking that.\n\n  This is fair given what Ethereum just did. But, IMO, that&#x27;s not what I expect if someone says &quot;warrant canary&quot;. Under the &quot;original&quot; sense of canaries, your scenarios wouldn&#x27;t make sense. Unfortunately, this new, wrong interpretation of the original idea seems to have become more common.<p>The original idea was that on some regular cadence (say weekly), you <i>actively</i> post a (hopefully signed) message somewhere saying &quot;I hereby attest that, as of &lt;insert current date&gt;, we have not received any warrants&#x2F;subpeonas&#x2F;etc and are not subject to any gag orders, etc. etc.&quot;. (eg, rsync.net&#x27;s canary: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;notices&#x2F;canary.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;notices&#x2F;canary.txt</a>). You have to set it up so that someone has to actually go and <i>do</i> something for the updated canary to go up, so it&#x27;s like a dead man&#x27;s switch. If you ever stop posting those, that&#x27;s the signal to users that something is up.<p>That approach is extremely robust legally. In the US at least, publicly posting a digitally signed message asserting something presumably important and valuable about your business that&#x27;s knowingly a lie would be considered false advertising, wire fraud, etc. depending on the exact situation. The government has a lot of power to legally compel you to <i>not</i> do things that would otherwise be legal (eg, uttering the speech &quot;we just got a subpeona for all of your data!&quot;). What they absolutely cannot <i>legally</i> do is compel you to do something illegal. Eg, they can&#x27;t make you commit wire fraud by actively lying to your customers about the services you provide. That&#x27;s a <i>very</i> strong legal position and you wouldn&#x27;t have a hard time getting a lawyer to back you up on it.<p>Basically, if your &quot;canary&quot; requires you to &quot;take down&quot; something, it&#x27;s not a proper canary and, yeah, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it to protect you from much.\n\n    That worked well for Joseph Nacchio.\n\n      Joseph Nacchio&#x27;s case has nothing to do with canaries.\n\n  I bet there&#x27;s a great organization that works on defending civil liberties in the digital world. It turns out they have an article on this, from a full decade ago. It also covers who else is using canaries, and existing, highly limited, precedent for compelled speech.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;warrant-canary-faq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;warrant-canary-faq</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;canary-watch-one-year-later\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;canary-watch-one-year-...</a>\n\nI suppose this IS the canary ... the removal of it ?\n\nOn the one hand, Congress&#x27; anti-crypto contingent is raising alarm over Bitcoin&#x27;s energy consumption.<p>On the other hand, they are calling on their allies in the SEC to reject the Ethereum ETF, while the SEC is using Ethereum&#x27;s transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake — which reduced its energy consumption by 99.99% — as the legal justification to designate Ethereum a security and thereby severely reduce the market&#x27;s access to it.<p>&quot;US Congressional Group ‘Disturbed’ by Crypto Mining Energy Usage&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;congressional-group-disturbed-by-crypto-mining-energy-usage&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;congressional-gro...</a><p>&quot;Democrats to SEC: Don&#x27;t approve spot Ethereum ETFs and any other crypto ETPs&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theblock.co&#x2F;post&#x2F;282846&#x2F;democrats-to-sec-just-say-no-to-spot-ethereum-etfs-and-any-other-crypto-etps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theblock.co&#x2F;post&#x2F;282846&#x2F;democrats-to-sec-just-sa...</a><p>&quot;According to a person at a company who received a recent subpoena request, the SEC’s probe of the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation began shortly after the blockchain’s shift to a new governance model known as “proof-of-stake” in September of 2022.&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;sec-gary-gensler-ether...</a>\n\n  Exactly this.

      "conversation_text": "I haven&#x27;t used Linux as a desktop in over 2 years, and I really miss Gnome.\n\nIs it at all possible to convince gnome-styled file pickers to put the &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons on the bottom of the window? It&#x27;s really jarring when working alongside other applications that either implement their own native file pickers or use a different widget toolkit. Gnome seems to be the only DE really pushing this style, and it&#x27;s *really* hard to find the relevant settings. Maybe I don&#x27;t know the implementation-specific keyword to help with the hunt?\n\n  This is why I stick to KDE. I like a lot of the aesthetic elements of GNOME, and some of their apps are pretty good, but I dislike the pseudo-macos simplicity that you mention. It&#x27;s like an attempt to be more like mac, without the good parts of mac.\n\n    Not needing to rely on hacked-together and essentially unsupported extensions for core functionality that breaks every other update is a nice plus too.<p>Besides, the aesthetics and workflow are portable from GNOME to KDE with some configuration (though not the other way around).\n\n    In KDE apps, can you move where the Cancel and Open buttons are in file dialogs?<p>If not, then your comment is a non sequitur.\n\n      They are just in reasonable and intuitive places to begin with. KDE arguably has an obscene amount of customization capabilities, though. I woudln&#x27;t be surprised.\n\nThe improvements seem extensive. Nice to see progress happening.\n\nThere is no section for bugfixes?\n\nGNOME has come a long way, but its stubborn insistence on not having a desktop with a real application launcher remains a huge usability misstep. GNOME&#x27;s marketshare <i>is</i> the desktop, and so the initial value proposition of a hybrid UI seems very much wishful thinking, while the keyboard based workflows it seems to want to enable are better served by tiling WM such as Sway, and do not make sense for the &quot;default&quot; WM that is picked up by casual converts who are used to a point and click system. Overall it&#x27;s just a confusing mess for new users, which Canonical&#x2F;System76 rationally get rid of (which is probably a majority of the GNOME user base).<p>So why does GNOME continue down this path. Is it a fear of being &quot;just like everyone else&quot; by using a tried and true dock&#x2F;application bar? Is it a desire to not be the front running WM and be more &quot;niche&quot; to power users? I still don&#x27;t really understand their decision making process.\n\n  Two things that made me switch to XFCE, JavaScript based extensions affecting performance, complete refusal to add back support for Windows shading (roll up).\n\n    That&#x27;s why System76 is writting extensions in Rust and runs them in seperate processes.\n\n      Whatever compiled language, even with my C related rants, I am happier with C written XFCE extensions than the GNOME JavaScript ones.<p>The separate process is an interesting point, back in the day dynamically loading code into the host process was the way to go, due to hardware resources and how demanding would be to use UNIX IPC for everything.<p>Now a couple of years later, with the existing hardware resources, and the ongoing stability and security issues of loading code into process, turns out separate process is a good idea after all.\n\n    which extensions are js-based?<p>there&#x27;s no gnome extension to do roll-up windows?\n\n      All of them, since they replaced the C API with the JavaScript based one in GNOME 3.0<p>&quot;GNOME Shell and extensions are written in GJS, which is JavaScript bindings for GNOME Platform APIs. For an overview of how extensions fit into GNOME Shell and the platform, see the Architecture page.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gjs.guide&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gjs.guide&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;</a><p>Roll-up was never an extension on UNIX windows managers, having to install one is a joke on us.<p>As for the GNOME developers stance on that, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;gnome-shell&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1028\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;gnome-shell&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1028</a><p>Meanwhile XFCE, KDE, Windowmaker, Afterstep, Enlightment.... do them just fine.\n\n        the shade issue seems to be an issue with wayland and whatnot as far i can tell..\n\n          That is why I wrote &quot;Meanwhile XFCE, KDE, Windowmaker, Afterstep, Enlightment.... do them just fine. &quot; to make the point the others handle it without excuses.\n\n  It took me a while to figure out what you mean by &quot;real application launcher&quot; but I think you mean that hitting the top left corner menu (or the Windows key) launches the fullscreen window overview plus launcher and that&#x27;s not enough for you?  I guess the &quot;Dash to Dock&quot; extension is what you&#x27;re after but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever missed it.  I don&#x27;t really use the keyboard for it, but every time I use a non-GNOME system I <i>badly miss</i> the ability to just click in the corner to manage programs, whether switching between them or launching new ones.  If GNOME got rid of this I would probably stop using GNOME.\n\n    the app launcher really only works on a laptop with gestures. pain in the butt with a mouse, especially on a large display.\n\n      On desktop my hands are 99% of the time already in the right position for the keyboard shortcuts.<p>I generally quite like the out-of-the-box gnome3+ experience, it fits my use cases pretty well (when I don&#x27;t have a highly tweaked custom tiling window manager setup).<p>It&#x27;s nice to actually get choice, rather than 5 &quot;choices&quot; that are all chasing exactly the same style, if you prefer the XFCE or KDE experience, then that&#x27;s what XFCE or KDE are for.\n\n        Proper choice would be the ability to customize that kind of thing in the DE. Having to switch the DE completely over <i>one</i> simple thing like this is, frankly, ridiculous.<p>But GNOME explicitly hates customizability.\n\n          &gt; Having to switch the DE completely over one simple thing like this is, frankly, ridiculous.<p>And who is forcing you to switch DEs over one simple thing? The parent comment is merely suggesting that we use the DE that we like the most (or--I&#x27;ll add--hate the least).\n\n            One simple thing can be such a major productivity blocker as to be a deal-breaker in practice.<p>And the situation where you have to choose between several options that all suck, and use the one that you hate the least, is exactly the one I&#x27;d rather avoid, but also the one that seems to most accurately describe the current state of software - precisely because of increasing lack of customizability and outright hostility to it.\n\n      and yet I have no issue using it with a mouse on a 27&quot; screen.<p>Certainly better than the tiny little window you get on every other OS.\n\n  &gt; remains a huge usability misstep<p>Evidence? The Gnome project has performed UX studies[0] to validate their design, and has continually made changes in response (some of which I disagree with, FWIW).<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Design&#x2F;Studies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Design&#x2F;Studies</a>\n\n    We just deployed RHEL9 and had to quickly revert gnome because users (and me!) had no effing idea how to use it.<p>For instance, no button to minimize and maximize a window, no taskbar to switch between windows, what the actual...\n\n      It took me almost half a year to figure out that Firefox was missing the minimize&#x2F;maximize button because Gnome by default hides them. And I only figured out after having to install Gnome Tweak tool because I moved to Gnome temporarily...\n\n    It is infuriating that they used systematic approaches to UX and still came up with the current thing. I said it before, too many implicit gestures that are not discoverable until you google for it.<p>Last time i tried GNOME was last week and gave up after a day.\n\n      What implicit gestures?  Everything in the Gnome desktop you can get to by clicking the &quot;Activities&quot; menu at the top-left: search bar, dock, applications button, minimized windows, and 2nd desktop all then become visible.<p>Granted, the applications button icon is quite nondescript (9 dots).  But it&#x27;s still just 2 clicks of prominent UI elements away.<p>Same # of clicks as Windows (Start -&gt; Program Files) and MacOS (Finder -&gt; Applications).\n\n        Maximizing a Window. I had to google how to do it.\n\n          What am I missing?.. there is a maximize button in the top-right corner of every window.<p>EDIT: Oh, I guess these are hidden by default?  I don&#x27;t remember enabling them on my setup but I&#x27;ve been using Gnome a few years now.  I agree it would be better if they were visible by default.\n\n            I only had a cross to close the window. Ubuntu 22.04.\n\n      A lot of times, what you should be doing should probably be relatively obvious anyway. [1] Other times, the people you should be trying to understand are already directly and nearly universally <i>telling</i> you how they feel, and all you actually have to do is just listen. [2]<p>I&#x27;m not saying systematic ways of thinking are universally useless, but the appearance of being &quot;systematic&quot; or &quot;objective&quot; certainly seems to attract some people who use complexity as a means of obfuscating, and of reducing other people to a passive object of study or subject of control. In those cases, &quot;research&quot; isn&#x27;t a way of <i>finding</i> what&#x27;s correct. The important thing to them is that <i>they&#x27;re</i> correct; they already know that they are, and the &quot;studies&quot; are meant to make sure you know it too as they do whatever they already wanted to do anyway.<p>Such individuals rarely seem to care about &quot;evidence&quot; at the start of their decisions. Only when they&#x27;re trying to shut down subjective critical opinions, or rationalize the actions they&#x27;ve already taken.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principle_of_least_astonishment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principle_of_least_astonishmen...</a><p>2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Controversy_over_GNOME_3&amp;oldid=635436587\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Controversy_over_...</a>\n\n        I did not know that the GNOME 3 thing was such a big controversy. I dropped GNOME during that time for the same reasons, but i was unaware of how big this was.\n\n          Oh yeah, no. Multiple entire desktop environments with significant popularity (Cinnamon, MATE) owe their existence today to how universally hated GNOME 3 was, and how obstinant and intolerant the GNOME developers were towards differing opinions that challenged their &quot;vision&quot;.<p>In fact, the same thing is sorta playing out even right now with GTK4 and other GNOME stuff, though I think with somewhat less public spectacle but arguably even larger development efforts behind it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuastrobl.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;building-an-alternative-ecosystem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuastrobl.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;building-an-alternative-...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;system76_developing_new_linux_desktop&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;system76_developing_n...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.system76.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;closing-in-on-a-cosmic-alpha\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.system76.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;closing-in-on-a-cosmic-alpha</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BuddiesOfBudgie&#x2F;budgie-desktop&#x2F;issues&#x2F;141\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BuddiesOfBudgie&#x2F;budgie-desktop&#x2F;issues&#x2F;141</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@fulalas&#x2F;gnome-mess-is-not-an-accident-4e301032670c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@fulalas&#x2F;gnome-mess-is-not-an-accident-4e...</a>\n\n    In my career, I witnessed several software UX changes that elicited massively negative user feedback once released - and every single one of those was backed by a UX study. It seems that if you have really strong opinions about what <i>you</i> want your software to look like, engineering UX studies around that is not difficult.\n\n      Most UX studies ignore that users want people to leave things the fuck alone and stop breaking their workflows.\n\n      Or,<p>UX changes always elicit negative opinions and the studies show that once the change is familiar people prefer the new UX.<p>I’m reminded of the MS ribbon which was so heavily derided but a few years in, OpenOffice&#x2F;LibreOffice also had to implement something similar because users significantly preferred it when set side by side.\n\n        I loved the ribbon on first sight. I also miss new features like that coming to products - nowadays it&#x27;s all AI nonsense or the padding and spacing has been changed for the 10th time.\n\n        I don&#x27;t think that this is always, or even more often, the case. I&#x27;ll grant you that Ribbon might be an exception.<p>But the bigger problem is that these days, even when it is the case, by the time you get used to the new UX, it&#x27;s not new anymore - and now <i>it</i> is on the way out, because the new crop of UX designers have yet another drastically different idea in mind (and they have UX studies to prove that it&#x27;s better). But change itself carries a usability cost with it, and that is usually not accounted for at all. When it comes to desktop software specifically, quite frankly, what we had 20 years ago was already &quot;good enough&quot;.\n\n    You just linked to studies that directly support my point:<p>&quot;On the other hand, new users generally got up to speed more quickly with Endless OS, often due to its similarity to Windows. Many of these testers found the bottom panel to be an easy way to switch applications. They also made use of the minimize button. In comparison, both GNOME 3.38 and the prototype generally took more adjustment for these users.<p>“I really liked that it’s similar to the Windows display that I have.”\n—Comment on Endless OS by a non-GNOME user&quot;\n\n    Evidence? No other somewhat popular desktop rejects &quot;core desktop ideas&quot; the way gnome does. Both windows and Mac have desktop icons, tray icons, a task bar&#x2F;dock, minimize and maximize buttons...\n\n  I know it&#x27;s not perfect but I use the &#x27;dash to panel&#x27; extension\n\n  I would assume that it&#x27;s because there are more people like me who use gnome. I kept using gnome 3 from gnome 2 because gnome 3 worked the way I was already using gnome 2.<p>I tried using tiling window managers, but they didn&#x27;t give me the niceties of the out of the box gnome experience.  I do have <i>one</i> extension for topicons. (sometimes I use gsconnect, but not recently)  I don&#x27;t need anything else.\n\n  Gnome is a DE designed to be used by distributions.<p>Gnome doesn’t have an opinion on a desktop application launcher because it expects the distribution to add it.<p>The only distributions which don’t are GnomeOS which is intended for developing Gnome, and Fedora, which is intended to be a bleeding edge distribution to mass release stuff before it’s included in RHEL.<p>Turns out, however, that a lot of people actually like the default Gnome look and so are happy with using Fedora.<p>But in practice this isn’t an issue for anyone because their distribution will come with an application launcher.<p>And even better you can completely change and&#x2F;or add an application launcher because they are implemented through extensions.\n\n    Every DE is designed to be used in a distribution. I think what you are trying to say is that GNOME is designed to be &quot;finished&quot; by the distribution, which is a completely made up idea. Show me where GNOME says you need to finish the DE yourself during integration. GNOME is designed as a complete DE, the reason Canonical&#x2F;System76 change it is because it&#x27;s poorly designed for new users&#x2F;casuals, which is their user base.\n\n    &gt; Gnome is a DE designed to be used by distributions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gnome doesn’t have an opinion on a desktop application launcher because it expects the distribution to add it.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true at all. Where have you read this? If GNOME intended for distributions to customize it, I can&#x27;t imagine why they&#x27;d keep harping on about how custom theming is awful. See: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.gnome.org&#x2F;alatiera&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-truth-they-are-not-telling-you-about-themes&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.gnome.org&#x2F;alatiera&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-truth-they-a...</a>, and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.gnome.org&#x2F;tbernard&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;restyling-apps-at-scale&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.gnome.org&#x2F;tbernard&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;restyling-apps-a...</a><p>I&#x27;m honestly surprised they still support adding extensions via extensions.gnome.org.\n\n      I mean the official position has always been reasonable, if disappointing. GNOME never had any official support for themes, it was just a concept invented by users who patched the CSS. It&#x27;s OSS so you can obviously do what you want but they aren&#x27;t going to support it and reserve the right to make changes that break your themes.\n\n        I&#x27;m not arguing against their position. Rather, I&#x27;m citing their position on theming to argue that it would feel inconsistent for them to hold that position on theming, but then also have a position of encouraging downstream distros to customize the whole UI&#x2F;UX of the DE.\n\n  &gt; So why does GNOME continue down this path.<p>Because it&#x27;s great and everyone apart from a tiny but incredibly vocal minority get on just fine with it.\n\n    Yeah! GNOME is wonderful. I can’t with the neckbeards.\n\n      I&#x27;m a neckbeard and I vastly prefer GNOME Shell to any other DE (including proprietary ones like on Windows and macOS). I still don&#x27;t consider myself a &quot;fan&quot; and I have plenty of complaints about it- I just have way more complaints about all the others... :D\n\n    GNOME seems to be least buggy DE and gets out of my way when doing things. A nice bonus is that it also looks and feels good.<p>I used to use plasma but it was just too buggy for me. Just today a random user realized that installing a theme from the built-in theme selection thingy deleted all his data...<p>I have some hope for cosmic DE as it seems like they try to emulate GNOME&#x27;s workflow with some twists.\n\n      As someone who had only used GNOME or DEs based on &#x2F; inspired by it for 18 years, I had to switch over to KDE on my work laptop because GNOME was giving me endless trouble with the external monitor for some reason (to the point where I could choose between either ridiculously impractical resolutions or mouse flickering).<p>I&#x27;m now actually quite satisfied with KDE (although I continue to use GNOME apps too). I guess every one of these DEs has their own share of bugs.\n\n    All these comments just want Gnome to be like every other DE in existence. MF&#x27;er leave my preferred DE alone, go use KDE if you want a traditional DE.\n\n  Last time I tried gnome it was in an Ubuntu install I think which had a weird launcher that imo didn’t work particularly well.<p>I’m not sure what you are meaning by a launcher here - to me there’s a fairly reasonable ambiguity about what is meant. On windows people still seem to use shortcuts on the desktop as a primary launcher (especially given the current start menu abomination, sheesh talk about destroying one of the most effective bits of UI MS ever produced), on Mac I actually mostly use spotlight (though that usage is subject to the “secret chord” problem), but most normal users use the dock for common apps and the applications folder for everything else.<p>I keep meaning to retry kde at some point but I’m waiting for more asahi work to support my desktop (they are reasonable to focus on the laptops but my laptop is my work machine so less willing to surrender disk space when llvm builds already consume half a TB).<p>It’s weird to me that back when I was a primarily Linux user gnome was The(tm) commercial Linux desktop and kde was the clunky also-ran, I assumed the gnome was destined to win in the long term due to gtk APIs, commercial support, and at the time seemingly more polish and completeness. I guess things can change given a decade or so of development :D\n\n  Because not everyone likes a classic app launcher? I like how reliable gnome&#x27;s search is, it replaces the start menu.<p>I just click super, see my workspaces, all of my running apps and can just directly start typing and find the app I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Why would I ever need a start menu? It&#x27;s soo good that KDE added something similar recently.\n\n  Gnome has a built in extension called “Applications Menu” that is just that.<p>I don’t really use it that much. I find opening search and typing what I want much faster. Or I use the dock\n\n  I’m not sure what you mean by application launcher. Is Super not enough?<p>Super, type 2 or 3 letters of the program I want, enter. Works really well for me.\n\n    Right? Also much faster than, I guess, scrolling with mouse through some menus\n\n    Vocally seconding this.  I wanted to <i>not</i> like Gnome (longtime wmi&#x2F;wmii&#x2F;i3 user) but its application launcher (and actually everything to do with the super&#x2F;three-finger swipe&#x2F;hot corner system) is <i>superb</i>.  I&#x27;m amazed how equally highly usable it is via keyboard, mouse, <i>and</i> touch.\n\n      Yeah, I was a big DWM user for a long time. I finally bit the bullet and gave Gnome a chance on Fedora a few years ago and it has an amazing keyboard workflow out of the box. Plus the extra mouse gesture goodies. People complain a lot about Gnome but if you engage with Gnome on its own terms the workflow is actually fantastic.\n\n    That&#x27;s completely undiscoverable.\n\n      Click on &quot;Activities&quot; in the upper-left corner.  (One of the few desktop UI elements.)  It is exactly the same thing as pushing the Super key.  A search bar pops up, start typing to search (EDIT: no 2nd click needed).\n\n        Which is terrible UI. Let&#x27;s force the user to turn a flow they could do at any time by clicking a single button at the bottom of their desktop into a context switch into another window, followed by the same button click. Or know about the Magic Keyboard short cut, then type in multiple characters, then press enter. So in any case we&#x27;re turning a single input into multiple inputs just to open a commonly used app.\n\n          What are you comparing to?  Windows has worked that way for 30 years (Start menu) and most users seem to figure it out fine.  So do smartphones (home button).  macOS is the only prominent example I can think of which shows icons of closed apps on the screen at all times by default.\n\n          It works identically to macOS Launchpad.\n\n        TIL you can open the activities with the Super key. GP complaint is totally warranted.\n\n          I agree it would be nice if Gnome displayed keyboard shortcuts in tooltips.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even a tweak to enable that unfortunately.\n\n          They recently (late 2022 maybe) released Gnome Tour which explains this stuff to new users. Admittedly it&#x27;s too late for people already on Ubuntu or something, but discoverability of these features is getting better.<p>Even in this article they mention adding a widget that displays shortcuts.\n\n    &gt; Super, type 2 or 3 letters of the program I want, enter. Works really well for me.<p>I don&#x27;t use GNOME and can&#x27;t speak for softirq, but what you&#x27;re describing sounds to me like a command line interface. I can imagine two problems with it:<p>- Ergonomics. People who usually keep a hand on the mouse would have to move to the keyboard whenever they launch an app, and then move back again. Not a showstopper, but definitely a time waster. (And perhaps just as annoying to some people as it is to me when no keyboard shortcuts are available for common actions.)<p>- Discoverability. If someone knows what they want to do but doesn&#x27;t know (or forgot) the names of the apps that can do it, they&#x27;re left to type in guesses until they find something that works out. Also, if they just want to browse the apps that came preinstalled on their system, an application launcher provides, while a command line interface does not.\n\n      Super does the exact same thing as clicking (or just mousing quickly to) &quot;Activities&quot; in the upper-left, which is one of the few UI elements visible on the desktop.<p>Docked apps also show up in this view, along with a button to show all apps.  (Similar workflow as Start -&gt; Program Files.)  Keyboard is unnecessary.<p>It&#x27;s somehow faster than every hardcore keyboard-based WM I&#x27;ve used (I was a <i>longtime</i> wmi&#x2F;wmii&#x2F;i3 user... all of which needed <i>two</i> keystrokes to open the app launcher, e.g. Super+P) <i>and also</i> every mouse-based WM I&#x27;ve used, <i>and also</i> works fantastically from my touchscreen when I&#x27;m feeling particularly lazy.\n\n      For Mouse ergonomics, there is hot corner which is great. You can open activities overview by flicking the mouse into the top left corner. Then click the app you want. I do that when I&#x27;m primarily using the mouse. I find it faster than the start menu on windows. If you really want a persistent bar at the bottom, then almost every distro includes that extension by default.<p>As far as discoverability, they have Gnome Tour now which opens on first launch that explains all this stuff interactively.\n\n      &gt; &gt; Super, type 2 or 3 letters of the program I want, enter. Works really well for me.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t use GNOME and can&#x27;t speak for softirq, but what you&#x27;re describing sounds to me like a command line interface. I can imagine two problems with it:<p>Don&#x27;t imagine. Get in the lab, see how people are using it and how you are actually using it.<p>It&#x27;s not a command-line. I run awesome and &lt;super&gt; r is a command line, as in &quot;if i don&#x27;t type the exact name of the application it won&#x27;t work, if i don&#x27;t type the exact first letters then tab won&#x27;t work&quot;. Try out gnome and see how it doesn&#x27;t behave the same.\n\n        &gt; Don&#x27;t imagine. Get in the lab, see how people are using it and how you are actually using it.<p>My point was simply that the actions described by the person to whom I replied fail to satisfy some common use cases, and do not refute the original complaint. It doesn&#x27;t take a research project to see that. I wasn&#x27;t commenting on whether there might be some other way to satisfy them.<p>In any case, I have tried GNOME recently, and found that it doesn&#x27;t suit me. Opinionated UI isn&#x27;t always bad, but this one is full of opinions that I find counterproductive.\n\n          &gt; &gt; Don&#x27;t imagine.

It doesn&#x27;t take a research project to see that. I wasn&#x27;t commenting on whether there might be some other way to satisfy them.<p>No, your points are simply not grounded in real usage:<p>&gt; - Discoverability. If someone knows what they want to do but doesn&#x27;t know (or forgot) the names of the apps that can do it, they&#x27;re left to type in guesses until they find something that works out.<p>Absolutely not. The default gnome launcher is still browsable with the mouse. You only have to scroll, which is way easier than clicking back and forth in kicker or tree based default menu where you have to guess which category the app you are looking for falls in. With Gnome, all the icons&#x2F;apps are laid out.<p>They are not left to type in guesses.<p>Guesses ? &quot;Jeez, I wonder which word I should type in to start libreoffice of firefox, let me try Internet navigator and word muncher&quot;. What weird imaginary use case is that.<p>&gt; Also, if they just want to browse the apps that came preinstalled on their system, an application launcher provides, while a command line interface does not.<p>Also... what ? Op wrote &quot;Super, type 2 or 3 letters of the program I want, enter. Works really well for me.&quot;<p>&quot;Program I want&quot;. Why are you bringing up discoverability as a counter-argument when it&#x27;s not what OP is doing ? It&#x27;s like complaining a terminal is problematic to start an app because there isn&#x27;t a list of icons to select. This is just moving the goal post from &quot;starting an app&quot; to discoverability.<p>&gt; I wasn&#x27;t commenting on whether there might be some other way to satisfy them.<p>&gt; In any case, I have tried GNOME recently, and found that it doesn&#x27;t suit me. Opinionated UI isn&#x27;t always bad, but this one is full of opinions that I find counterproductive.<p>Okay, I see, this is just pissing on gnome for the sake of pissing on it then.\n\n            &gt; Okay, I see,<p>You don&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m done with your rudeness. Goodbye.\n\n    No it&#x27;s not, for several reasons:<p>1. Average users primarily use mouse based workflows.<p>2. Super isn&#x27;t discoverable.<p>3. It confused users coming from other DEs.<p>4. It actually takes more keypresses than clicking a favorited app on a dock that is always available.<p>Overall it&#x27;s less discoverable, less efficient, and not baked into the mind of computer users who are coming from almost any other bistro.\n\n      Oh I see, you&#x27;re arguing for a dock-style mouse-based app launcher.  I see no reason there can&#x27;t be both that and keyboard-based Spotlight-like launcher too.  It&#x27;s not like one impedes the functionality of the other.\n\n      &gt; Overall it&#x27;s less discoverable, less efficient, and not baked into the mind of computer users who are coming from almost any other bistro<i>t</i>.<p>I see what you did :).\n\n    Personal opinion but to me this is the best way of moving around a computer - to be point where it’s all I do in macOS as well. Can’t remember the last time I saw a dock there.\n\n    &gt; Super, type 2 or 3 letters of the program I want, enter. Works really well for me.<p>You&#x27;ve just described basically <i>every</i> modern desktop user interface. Windows Start Menu (&quot;Windows Key&quot;), Cinnamon menu, KDE defaults, XFCE (w&#x2F; Whisker Menu), etc. all support the [Super]→[Start typing]→[Enter] launch workflow.\n\n    Same.  Every OS I use always make sure it has this kind of simple app launcher.  Super key -&gt; search field -&gt; autocomplete -&gt; enter -&gt; app starts.  What more do you need?  Most OS&#x27;s have a version built-in nowadays.  Seems like a solved problem.\n\n  I&#x27;ve been enjoying Budgie for this reason. It feels like a &quot;normal&quot; desktop experience with a taskbar at the bottom, something like a start-menu with the search functionality we&#x27;re used to, and without anything really trying to be fancy or transparent. It just feels &quot;regular&quot;.<p>The criticism some people have of Budgie is that it feels like a customized version of GNOME rather than its own thing - but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m not looking for something to ditch the good parts of GNOME. I&#x27;m looking for something that will just give me a regular desktop where things feel like what macOS or Windows have been offering for a couple decades.\n\n    Out of curiosity, why Budgie over XFCE, MATE, or LXDE? All of those are pretty much just a &quot;normal&quot; desktop experience with a taskbar, something like a start menu with search, or anything trying to be fancy or transparent.<p>Nothing against Budgie, I&#x27;m just curious what made it stand out for you.\n\n  Not sure how much this is still true, but as I recall, GNOME used to have a &#x27;start&#x27; launcher like Windows, and removed it because of a lawsuit (gates&#x2F;ballmer era Microsoft). That was the big motivation for gnome 2 to 3, and also why canonical split off unity for a while\n\n  &gt; while the keyboard based workflows it seems to want to enable are better served by tiling WM such as Sway<p>This is where I think your analysis starts to break down. Tiling and keyboard-oriented are <i>almost</i> orthogonal. There&#x27;s no a priori reason that a tiling WM <i>has</i> to be keyboard-oriented, nor that floating WMs are inherently less accommodating to keyboard-oriented workflows. As an anecdote, way back in my youth, I had all kinds of keyboard shortcuts for resizing and moving windows by different amounts in my Openbox WM setups. Likewise, I really <i>tried</i> to like the popular tiling WMs (i3, xmonad, AwesomeWM), but I eventually realized that I can&#x27;t literally be focusing on content from multiple windows simultaneously, and it makes way more sense for me to size and position each window so that I can optimize my interactions with that one when I <i>am</i> focusing on it.<p>&gt; do not make sense for the &quot;default&quot; WM that is picked up by casual converts who are used to a point and click system. Overall it&#x27;s just a confusing mess for new users, which Canonical&#x2F;System76 rationally get rid of (which is probably a majority of the GNOME user base).<p>Let&#x27;s be real, though. The year of Linux On The Desktop is not coming--hell, The Desktop is pretty much dying altogether. So, I really don&#x27;t care if we optimize for the &quot;casual computer user&quot; who just happens to stumble into a chair in front of a Linux desktop, because that person doesn&#x27;t exist. It may sound selfish, but I rather they optimize for users who already exist.<p>&gt; GNOME has come a long way, but its stubborn insistence on not having a desktop with a real application launcher remains a huge usability misstep.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; So why does GNOME continue down this path. Is it a fear of being &quot;just like everyone else&quot; by using a tried and true dock&#x2F;application bar?<p>GNOME is actually fairly close to macOS in this regard. Yes, macOS has a dock with an application launcher, but if I didn&#x27;t already know what the application launcher icon looks like, I&#x27;d have no idea how to get to its application launcher: the icon I&#x27;m looking at right now on my work Mac is a square icon with a 3x3 grid of colored squares inside it--what the hell does that mean? Is it a color picker app? Some kind of Tetris or Candy Crush game?<p>GNOME&#x27;s top-left stupid oval button is equally bad, but not worse, than macOS&#x27;s UX discoverability, IMO.<p>And I have to wonder how truly &quot;intuitive&quot; the Windows situation is, either. The old Windows versions used to have the word &quot;Start&quot; on the button, which at least gives some kind of hint that my computing journey &quot;begins&quot; there. I think since Vista or 7, it&#x27;s basically just been the Windows icon. I <i>suspect</i> it&#x27;s more intuitive than the macOS or GNOME analogs, but probably only a tiny bit if I were to sit someone down who hasn&#x27;t used a Windows PC in their life.\n\nJust an anecdote: I&#x27;m currently patching nautilus to move ellipsisation of long filenames in the list view mode from center to right aligned, because of course there is no option for it, but technical books tend to have several authors, long names, and with Gnome&#x27;s default center ellipsisation I can only see the author list and the year of a book.<p>Another pet peeve of mine is the lack of type ahead. The relatively recent type ahead efforts were blocked (or stalled) by &quot;design considerations&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;Design&#x2F;whiteboards&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;142\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;Design&#x2F;whiteboards&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1...</a> As the result Gnome Files is very unpleasant to use for deep trees with thousands of files in every directory on spinning media (zfs). The standard search feature also destroys context, i.e. being able to see the files filtered out by the query.<p>This release is also consecutively the third time they moved the list of ongoing file operations -- from top right, to top left, to bottom left. With all the obsession about &quot;not confusing users&quot; that the Gnome&#x27;s leading figures declare the constant change in the UX should be one of the primary sources of the actual confusion users experience.\n\n  One of many annoyances I have with GNOME, is that they still insist on forcing their slow search crap, instead of doing the sensible thing (that literally everyone else does) and give type-ahead search.\n\n  I just want Miller Columns like macOS Finder. Either Gnome or KDE, that view always feels &quot;right&quot; to me.\n\n    Pantheon Files has them. Can fit in well enough as a Nautilus replacement.\n\nGnome breaking compatibility of extensions on EVERY single release means I hate relying on extensions for anything important.\n\n  Gnome breaking all of System76 Cosmic extentions resulted in them saying &quot;We rather make our own desktop instead of having to rework everything all the time&quot;.\n\n  Urgh yes! As far as I understand this is all because extensions have to opt in and say &quot;yes this works with the new gnome&quot; or else it won&#x27;t run so even if everything actually <i>dies</i> run fine, it won&#x27;t work until an update is patched.<p>I do understand the gnome team wanting to guarantee a good user experience with extensions, but I can&#x27;t help but think the damage caused by breaking every extension on every release is worse than some of them working unpredictably.\n\n  The &quot;workaround&quot; I have found for this is to use a slow-updating, non-rolling distro; in my case it&#x27;s Debian.\n\nI&#x27;m sure this year is going to be the year of the Linux desktop.\n\n  NixOS finally convinced me to switch, since the declarative config and rollback functionality meant I went from accidentally bricking (or at minimum &quot;mysteriously unstabling&quot;) each previous Linux distro I tried at least once a year (NixOS basically gives you built-in safety belts to counter all the untested possible Linux configurations) to being able to mess with configs to my hearts&#x27; content with aplomb (since backing out is trivial and can be done in GRUB). It really feels like &quot;Linux, unleashed&quot; and like I&#x27;ve made the &quot;final distro hop.&quot; There is a feeling of &quot;Yep, this is it!&quot; I have the same fearless feeling to alter configs that I have in macOS, except with, you know, more open-source and less walled-garden...<p>Plus, I can finally boot off ZFS and a mirrored boot drive with no worries thanks to an excellently written guide and first-class ZFS support (just pick the latest ZFS-compatible kernel via a special config that automatically does this for you!)<p>The negative of course is that Nix&#x2F;NixOS have a learning curve. Once you grok it, though, you will literally want to install it on ALL your machines. It has eliminated so many headaches (assuming you can find the right option to tweak).\n\n  It has been for me for a while now, it comes packaged on a desktop VM like VMWare Workstation, Virtual Box, and now WSL.<p>The only I still bother are classical desktop like towers and NUCs, on laptops I have less headaches with a VM.<p>Then for everything else, my distributions are Android&#x2F;Linux, WebOS&#x2F;Linux and whatever Sony decided to use on their Blue Ray players.\n\nI am seriously considering a look at KDE 6.  I&#x27;ve kind of settled on Gnome plus some extensions (arc menu and dash to panel) over years, but they don&#x27;t really give me exactly the feel I want, and the extensions I use may or may not work the way I expect them to at the time Gnome releases.<p>Every time I look at the release notes for Gnome, I continually find myself either not excited or disappointed in different decisions, additions and removals that were made.<p>I&#x27;ve tried i3&#x2F;sway and hyperland recently.  The problem is they don&#x27;t work well with all the applications I need to support (zoom, slack).  Gnome typically &quot;just works&quot; and is why I wind up continuing to use it.\n\n  You might want to wait a little while, or look at 5 instead, because Plasma 6 was only just released and is still shaking out early bugs.<p>&gt; Every time I look at the release notes for Gnome, I continually find myself either not excited or disappointed in different decisions, additions and removals that were made.<p>This extends into the toolkit as well. I was happily using XFCE until it adopted Gtk 3, at which point it quickly went downhill. The GNOME maintainers&#x27; insistence on designs that I find frustrating, the frequent removal of common desktop features that I use, and the general fragility imposed on applications that surfaces whenever the toolkit gets minor updates, all conspired to drive me away.<p>It took some time and effort to migrate to KDE Plasma, but it was worth it. I&#x27;m pretty happy with my desktop again.\n\n    The KDE 6 Changes are mostly under the hood, so you don&#x27;t lose a lot in terms of user experience either way.\n\n  GNOME is somewhat frustrating to me because there’s a number of things that I feel it gets more “right” than KDE, at least for <i>me</i>, but there’s about as many things that it doesn’t. KDE gets a lot of things “somewhat right” but also gets more less wrong, making it maybe better overall but still not leaving me satisfied.<p>I appreciate that both exist free of charge as the result of a lot of time that people didn’t have to volunteer and shouldn’t be taken for granted. I’m glad both exist and continue to be maintained, but regardless, the situation leaves me much less jazzed about the Linux desktop than I’d like to be.<p>Window manager setups might be a solution, but they take a <i>lot</i> of effort to make as polished as any of the major DEs, requiring the user to hunt down daemons to get tray items and the like. They also have a strong disposition towards hyper-minimal tiling which isn’t my thing, something along the lines of openbox is probably the most minimal I’d want to go but WMs like that don’t see much fanfare.\n\n  If you&#x27;re interested in i3&#x2F;sway but want something that &quot;just works&quot;- have you checked out Regolith?<p>I used to daily drive it and was a big fan- it&#x27;s basically i3 + gnome for stuff like settings etc. So you get a nice simple tiling window manager, but don&#x27;t have to install something new whenever you want to (eg) get Bluetooth working.\n\n  KDE is truly a great DE. I am still on 5.27, have not upgraded to 6 yet (Debian woes, lol) but considering all the praise I have heard - it is probably even better than the experience I have now which is solid. I am running Debian 12 with Wayland on AMD hardware. Everything &quot;just works&quot;. I can record stuff with OBS studio, loom recording works, slack calls&#x2F;screensharing works great, vscode, 1pass, spotify. I have been a macOS user since Tiger (10.4, intel transition) and have dabbled on and off with desktop Linux over the last decade but lately it is truly solid and quite polished.<p>My current setup: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;fnwnmfzvr4pc1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;fnwnmfzvr4pc1.png</a>\n\nAfter spending most of a decade in i3wm, I decided to give Gnome a try again.<p>The most debilitating issue that I kept running into over and over again was extension memory leak.<p>After a restart and within a week, gnome shell process would end up using 10GB. And all guides on how to debug this seem to say: turn off extensions one at a time to see what&#x27;s leaking.<p>Speaking to others I realised that I&#x27;m not the only one facing this.<p>I just threw in the towel and switched to KDE. It has been smooth sailing since.<p>Gnome shell desperately needs a resource monitor for extensions IMO.\n\n  I wonder what percentage of users uses extensions other than distro defaults\n\n    I use a bunch thanks to NixOS&#x27; ease of installing them, such as the one that previews a file by hitting spacebar (which is a knock-off of the same functionality in MacOS).\n\n    Given that GNOME has quite a few stuff that they shift into extensions, even distro defaults make use of them.\n\n    GNOME Tweaks has a lot of settings options that should be in the default software.\n\nA very nice release, especially the new VRR support is awesome.\n\nAs someone who mostly accesses their Linux desktops via RDP, I’m curious to see how good the new integrated RDP support is (all my `xorgxrdp` setups are tweaked to do sound, accelerated graphics, etc.)\n\nMore great work from the University of Bob Seger.\n\n  Sorry, what?\n\n    Sorry, just making low content posts. It&#x27;s a punchline from an entirely unrelated Norm Macdonald joke ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DBs5Al_eudc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DBs5Al_eudc</a> ), but I thought of it because Seger had a famous song called &quot;Kathmandu&quot;.\n\nGnome is the best advertisement for KDE Plasma.\n\nFor the RDP remote login, assuming they refer to the MS RDP protocol, are they using xrdp as a backend or have they developed something themselves?\n\n  I think it&#x27;s implemented by gnome-remote-desktop, which uses FreeRDP for RDP support.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;gnome-remote-desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;gnome-remote-desktop</a>\n\nPlease bring back Miller Columns!<p>NeXTSTEP had them in 1986.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miller_columns\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miller_columns</a><p>Here are two reasons I stick with macOS:<p><pre><code>  1) Miller Columns\n  2) The Magic Mouse\n</code></pre>\nNot the only two, but two seemingly unreproducible features by other desktop OS vendors and makers of peripherals! :-)\n\nLast time I tried Gnome I was struggling with the inability to remap shortcuts to clear a way for using my Emacs bindings without the desktop interfering. The ctrl-shift-f for a global search sounds like a generally bad idea that will conflict with a lot applications. Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t impose itself on applications but only the desktop, I don&#x27;t know.<p>But one thing I know that if I disagree with Gnome developers then I&#x27;ll have a hard time working around and hacking my own way in. I&#x27;ve usually ended up starting to patch Gnome&#x2F;Gtk components at which points I just realize that it is absolutely futile and I give up.<p>Gnome used to be the marvel of configurability. Around Gnome2 time there were gazillion settings and options that you could change, and even more via gsettings&#x2F;gconf. Then the UI was gradually dumbed down but you could still configure most things. &quot;Tweak&quot; tools appeared. Now it seems I bump into an ideological obstacle left and right, and even the tweak tools won&#x27;t let me change anything much besides some cosmetic properties.<p>Mate has some rough edges but it&#x27;s pretty much the only thing that still works for a power user that wants an UI with a traditional window manager of my choice instead of whatever tiling configuration is in hype this year.\n\nIt&#x27;s amazing to see the accessibility improvements listed in an actual release note. I do wish the images on the page were labeled with Alt-text though."

      "conversation_text": "I believe “world models” are the future of the field so I really need better performance in areas like IVP, FFT, special functions (e.g., harmonics), and dynamic programming. The H100 advances (e.g., DPX instructions) are terrific but they feel like a starting point. Hell, improved geometric operations (e.g., triangulation and intersection) would be killer too and surely that expertise exists at NVIDIA! The H100, especially for the price, feels terrible when you’re training a neural network bottlenecked on an operation that flies on a consumer CPU when you know there’s GPU optimizations that have been left on the floor.\n\n  I suspect these can be patched in as well - most of these functions have implementations in CUDA implying they should be able to run on the hardware even without dedicated instructions.\n\n    This was one of the selling points for RISC: to focus on the most frequently used instructions and implement the rest in software would yield smaller and faster designs.<p>I have the feeling that GPUs are on the sweet spot where smaller footprint directly translates into more executions and, therefore, higher throughput for the same chip area.\n\nIt would appear the G in GPU now stands for AI.\n\n  They might re-purpose the G to Generative<p>Generative Processing Unit works for all cases.\n\n  When AI is in everything, G would  become General\n\n    Together with the newly-peripheral PPU (formerly known as CPU)\n\n      CPU is gonna be the coprocessor when most things are inferenced instead of strictly calculated.\n\n  Apu already taken by aviation tho\n\n    Auxiliary Power Unit.<p>Both aviation and computers use them, though the latter more often call them UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply).\n\n      Let&#x27;s be real, nobody cares about their acronyms being unique or not confusing.\n\n        But that&#x27;s not what parent comment was talking about.\n\n    And by AMD (Accelerated Processing Unit, their term for CPUs with good integrated graphics like what Xbox and PlayStation consoles use).\n\n    And The Simpsons\n\n    So is GPU (Ground power unit)\n\n  I think the fact that people sometimes use the letter g to denote generalized intelligence might be useful here.<p>You could call them gPUs.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;G_factor_(psychometrics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;G_factor_(psychometrics)</a>\n\nCrazy that video game graphics business happened to be the secret level portal to AI land\n\n  In hindsight I think it makes good sense - game graphics were always aiming to represent worlds with as high fidelity as possible.\n\n    Good point, but it is interesting that the computations to render visual worlds in high fidelity is the same computation to &quot;ingest&quot; the data to create a model.<p>Reminds me of how a mic is a speaker and speaker is a mic.\n\n      I think it speaks to the generalizability of linear algebra.\n\n  nVidia claims that they went into video games because it provided a way to fund their goal of compute accelerators\n\n    I don&#x27;t believe that claim one bit. That reads like revisionist history if I&#x27;ve ever seen it. If there&#x27;s sources that back it up, fine, but until I see pretty reasonable proof I&#x27;m going to take that as CEO grandstanding while the market is hot.\n\n      What is so hard to believe?  Technology evolves rapidly.  I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone investing big money in compute technology wouldn&#x27;t have expected that.\n\n        You do understand nVidia dates back to fixed pipeline accelerators for essentially some vertices and textures, right?\n\n        Because that happened in a time when there were many players in the 90s each making their own GPUs for gaming purposes specifically. Compute was not even on the picture until things like CUDA and OpenCL came out.\n\n          Back in the late 90s, there was a project at SGI, called Bali, to make all their pipelines work in IEEE 32-bit floating point (they were using Intel i860 chips) so that they could do HW rendering of scenes written in Pixar&#x27;s Renderman language.<p>Sony copied that idea for the 1st Playstation, and then folks like NVidia &amp; 3DLabs quickly followed suit, the idea being they would enable that functionality for games like Final Fantasy.<p>In the early 2000s, the HPC folks realized that you could use a GPU for physics &amp; engineering codes, and here were are 20 yrs later.\n\n      You can find slides from IIRC one of their first GPUs talking about how they can be made into very capable compute accelerators. They&#x27;ve supported CUDA on most of their GPUs since 2007 while the competition is still struggling to put out a truly equivalent solution. Even before that they had Cg.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that they saw the writing on the wall about the value of GPUs for massively parallel computing and actively pushed to be in the right spot for when everything took off.\n\n        And probably they&#x27;d been at least thinking about that since the early 2000s to have it ready by then.  But the claim is that they were thinking about it since their beginning in 1993, and that&#x27;s the part that just seems hard to believe.\n\n          That&#x27;s the claim Jensen has made, and while there isn&#x27;t any particular evidence besides his word to go off for the founding goal, it&#x27;s worth considering that between 1993 and 1998 they only put out 2 chips. The first one was quadratic primitive based (which, sounds more focused towards a future of compute applications, due to the ease of representing equations in such a form), and the second one was a last ditch effort triangle primitive chip to avoid bankruptcy after DirectX settled on triangle primitives. So I don&#x27;t really think those years count for much in terms of determining what their goal was.<p>Their release cadence only really picked up in 1998, and just 2-3 years later they had the first &#x27;programmable&#x27; GPUs with early shaders.<p>As such, saying that NVIDIA wasn&#x27;t always aiming for GPU compute feels kinda like saying that SpaceX wasn&#x27;t always aiming for feasibly reusable rocketry because it took them ~15 years to build up to their current version of it.\n\n            Also a funny &#x27;existential&#x27; point to remember. You have a clean idea (doing math &#x2F; quad-splines) but the market sinks it.. doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be good later. It&#x27;s a game of long and patient grind.\n\n      Nvidia has been peddling compute for decades. They&#x27;ve long been selling enterprise tier cards for industrial purposes that are ill-suited to games. In many ways CUDA has been their long running attempt to break out of gaming.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised here. They invested and invested and invested and now everyone is playing catch up while they nearly corner the market. In industry circles we&#x27;ve been lamenting their dominance in this area for well over a decade.<p>Google and Apple are the only companies I see that have a shot at disrupting their market but they tend to end up navel gazing instead of burning bridges. And Nvidia has bridges with everyone.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely an industrial geopolitics mastercraft scenario. We&#x27;ll be studying them for a century.<p>Everyone has long known that the secret to unlocking the next tier of performance is solving concurrency. Look at all the advances that have made it into production in the last twenty years. But threading models only get you so far on a CPU, and programming GPUs is comparatively very difficult. Nvidia has always aimed to displace the CPU&#x27;s prominence, since day one.<p>It&#x27;s horizontal scaling 101.\n\n        Decades is still long after the first GeForce. Before CUDA we had third parties using graphics primitives to run general purposes computing.<p>So I&#x27;m not buying it.\n\n        They&#x27;ve been peddling compute since mid-2000&#x27;s, however Nvidia has been around for much longer. To the revisionist history point, I&#x27;m unfamiliar seeing any of this prior to that. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, they were very much a graphics only company competing with 3dfx, Matrox, S3, ATi, etc\n\n          They were founded in 1993, but until 1998 had only put out 2 chips, the first was a quadratic surface renderer that didn&#x27;t sell well, and the second was a normal triangle rasterizer that saved them from bankruptcy. Then in 2001 they released the first GPU that could run code, each subsequent generation expanding on that capability until they were able to do general purpose compute with CUDA.\n\n        Nvidia was selling cards with hardware acceleration since 1997. The first one I own is from 1998, and its advantage wasn&#x27;t that it had superior compute, but that it also included the non-3d circuitry of the rest of the video card. So instead of having a 2d card and a Voodoo, which were daisy chained, you could use that a lone Riva TNT that will do both. So they started being less about compute than the competition.<p>Between the first nvidia cards and the first release of CUDA, you have a decade.\n\n          &gt;  So instead of having a 2d card and a Voodoo, which were daisy chained, you could use that a lone Riva TNT that will do both<p>Or get the slightly underpowered Banshee.\n\n      They tried to do physics acceleration at one point. I think they were trying to find a niche for their DSP-style compute.\n\n        &gt; They tried to do physics acceleration at one point<p>Well, there is PhysX which they bought in 2008 and still have; when they bought PhysX they shifted the acceleration implementation from relying on dedicated physics accelerator hardware to GPGPU.<p>There’s APEX which was built on top of PhysX but later discontinued.<p>There’s FleX…<p>“At one point” might be a slight misstatement.\n\n      It&#x27;s not hard to believe.<p>The idea that future of computing is related to parallel numerical computing and linear algebra (HPC, graphics  ,scientific computing,  data science, machine learning) predates current deep learning boom.<p>Already in 2003 and GPGPU (General-purpose computing on graphics processing units) was a thing. OpenVidia came out in 2003.\n\n      I&#x27;m 50&#x2F;50 on this. I don&#x27;t think they ever envisioned (npi) that gaming would grow that much and would allow them to pivot back into GPU based HPC. That said they might always had a dream hinting at this.\n\n    Highly doubt this was the initial idea for nvidia given they were graphics-only for a very long time.  CUDA definitely felt like more of a value-add for the first 5-6 years than a concerted effort to build accelerators and to fund that with graphics demand.  First &quot;tesla&quot; line of GPUs - which had very little compute-only focus - were in 2007.\n\n      &gt;First &quot;tesla&quot; line of GPUs - which had very little compute-only focus - were in 2007.<p>CUDA was first released in ~2006 but started at least in 2004, largely building on top or the momentum of Cg which was released in 2002 and being worked on since 2000. There was at the time in the late 90s about general purpose parallel programming and how it could possible be done on GPUs or doing it on something like PS2 Cell.<p>I dont know if Nvidia was really started with CUDA in mind in 1993. But Nvidia was into CUDA like GPU usage <i>WAY</i> ahead of anyone else in the field.\n\n        Cell was PS3 (2006)\n\n        Wasn&#x27;t there a time when people were hacking shaders to do compute tasks and read the results back instead of displaying to the frame buffer?\n\n          Yes, multiple such attempts, including complete languages. Very thin hardware support as different GPUs varied very much on what could be done.<p>GeForce 8 introduced CUDA because graphics pipeline similarly evolved into position where instead of forcing the use of dedicated cores for specific tasks (vector and fragment shaders) due to simple economies of chip making, the Shader Model 4 introducing yet another stage justified making unified shader cores... which could be just as easily used for other tasks.\n\n    Of course, obviously ever since inception of the company they had the noble goal of uplifting human race. It was just the set of unfortunate circumstances that forced them to make trivial utility devices just to survive long enough\n\n      They did a lot on medical scan visualization pretty early on too.\n\n    &quot;When we were selling shovels to coal miners, we always secretly knew there was gold in those hills.&quot;<p>Yeah, sure.\n\n    Then why does my graphics card have 5 video outputs?\n\n    And tell me what is Nvidia trying to fund with the AI business?\n\n  Does a series of matrix multiplications have a soul?\n\n    Does a series of electrical impulses in a brain?\n\n      Obviously no, because signals take time to move from A to B, while humans live in the now.\n\n    Matrix multiplication is just an effective representation for the dense graph structures. The same graphs could be implemented in other ways (adjacency list, edge list), perform the same overall logic, without doing vector&#x2F;matrix&#x2F;tensor math. It seems like the magic is in the overall idea of neurons and networks of them following increasingly interesting architectures and training mechanisms.<p>But because these graphs are mostly dense and involve numerical operations, matrices&#x2F;tensors are a great implementation.\n\n    Define &quot;soul&quot;.\n\n    Does a bunch of atoms arranged into proteins have a soul?\n\n    does a SQL table provide a stochastic representation of conceptual symbolics?<p>oh, sorry, I thought we were just asking questions\n\n  Nah, Intel said Nvidia just got &quot;lucky&quot;\n\n    So says every loser when they are bested by their own ignorance.\n\n  Ever since GPUs became programable, which goes earlier than many think (see TMS34010 from 1986), there has been many attempts to use the cards for general purpose compute.<p>It turns out that anything related to neural networks, and similar AI approaches, is all about compute.\n\n    I&#x27;d say almost the opposite in practice.<p>GPUs, as they became programmable (and maybe even a little bit before that...), started to take cues from SIMD Supercomputers. So the compute methodologies were researched first, and then GPUs (ie: applications to graphics) were applied afterwards.<p>I&#x27;ve heard rumors that the first programmable GPUs were considered because GPUs already were in SIMD-style compute and running instructions in a programmable way at the hardware&#x2F;firmware level. It just needed to be &quot;revealed&quot; to OpenGL or DirectX programmers.\n\n      TMS34010 used a C like SDK, in 1986, there were hardly any SIMD supercomputers, unless you consider Cray and Connection Machines as model.\n\n        I&#x27;m thinking closer to 90s period, where &quot;graphics cards&quot; developed by Voodoo &#x2F; 3dfx and its Glide API were clearly along the DirectX &#x2F; OpenGL inspiration path. (3d Graphics pipeline &#x2F; transform &amp; lightning &#x2F; etc. etc.). I don&#x27;t know the exact point when these 3d accelerators became programmable with vertex&#x2F;pixel shaders, but Glide is clearly on the path and part of the history here.<p>--------<p>You&#x27;re right in that 80s &#x2F; Arcade chips look to be different. Its a programmable graphics chip alright, but I wouldn&#x27;t call that chip SIMD, not from what I can see from Wikipedia at least.\n\n          I wasn&#x27;t the one bringing SIMD into the picture. :)\n\n  Watch this 90s commercial for 3dfx: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ooLO2xeyJZA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ooLO2xeyJZA</a><p>GPUs always had more compute &#x2F; Gigaflops than traditional computers. GPUs in fact have more to do with 80s-era supercomputer architecture than normal CPUs.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ODIqbTGNee4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ODIqbTGNee4</a>\n\n    I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just nostalgia, but I still like the final 3dfx logo, at least in a video game context.\n\n    That was an unexpected twist.\n\nIf this thing is all about AI why are we calling it a GRAPHICS processing unit still?<p>Don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s because of familiarity with the word GPU. Nvidia could coin a new acronym and write a PR release and the entire world would circulate it and even discuss it in here and every other vendor would scramble to play catch-up.\n\n  Already there&#x27;s the addition of TPUs, tensor processing units\n\n  Presumably they still want something to sell once the bubble pops.\n\n  The improvements focus on AI, but it&#x27;s still a GPGPU oriented chip. Due to how language works, it doesn&#x27;t really matter that graphics isn&#x27;t the main focus anymore, the chip still follows the same basic architectural principles as what is expect of a modern GPU, thus it is a GPU.\n\n  &gt; Don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s because of familiarity with the word GPU<p>It&#x27;s because of familiarity with the word GPU...\n\n  &gt; If this thing is all about AI why are we calling it a GRAPHICS processing unit still?<p>Because names are sticky, and no one wants to start evangelizing a new term (“Matrix Math Processing Unit”) for it, preferring to put energy into things with value.\n\nI&#x27;m just super curious where these chips will be in 10 years - not the state of the chip design - these physical chips.<p>It will be interesting when chips such as this percolate down to single folks using one of these to just run their home AI node.<p>When every building has just one of these in their core building AI system that allows for all the regular talk to your smart home and have it intelligently accommodate your inferred needs&#x2F;intentions.<p>Its possible today - but I mean on a wide scale.\n\n  I am not hopeful at all that it will go that way.<p>Instead, I expect those buildings to invest in having the fastest, most stable internet connection with added redundancy and everything will be fully centralized in datacenters.\n\n    Fair - I guess these will be relegated to &#x27;Evil Lair Under Ground Bunker&#x27;(TM) types - like Zucks Hawaii compound&#x27;s internal datacenter on-prem.<p>EDIT: the 10-year is just a random number.<p>And while these chips will obviously eventually be obsoleted as far as their cutting-edge - that doesnt remove the usefulness of such a chip for as long it can logic electrons.<p>So even by any future standard - as few of these thrown in more a consumer space will be adding of value for a long time, one would think. I&#x27;d be really interested in knowing about fab re-tooling.<p>I recall one night at Intel in 1997 or so - I stepped onto the balcony to have a smoke at about 1am.<p>There was another guy there who was in finance and we had a similar smoke schedule - and we would chat. He was lamenting about the difficulty in his work was to re-work a lot of DB schemas because some of the numbers he had to entire as far as finances, were too large for the fields.<p>I never forgot that - or a common trope that was thrown around intel at the time - I was in my early 20s and was focused on video games when at Intel - so I didnt get to follow along with this: &quot;Its cheaper to just build a new fab than to retool one for the next iteration of processor&quot;<p>-- so I wonder just how much ancillary waste happens these days with each new chip iteration&#x2F;evolution. Meaning - all the amounts of resources that went into the fab to make such a chip - and where these wind up in their lifecycle.<p>The newest machines to make the ultra EUV chips are ~$380 million a piece (which is nothing these days on a scale - but on a unit basis, thats a Fton.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;23&#x2F;inside-asml-the-company-advanced-chipmakers-use-for-euv-lithography.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;23&#x2F;inside-asml-the-company-adva...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;say0bnv.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;say0bnv.png</a>\n\n  They wouldn&#x27;t, because in 10 years time the consumer-grade equivalent will out-power this model, assuming the increase in performance and decrease in cost persists.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a few people that have e.g. an intel itanium from 10 years ago in their home lab, but those don&#x27;t hold a candle to current-day consumer grade CPUs.\n\nIf everyone and their cousin is bullish on compute, then what’s the bear thesis here? Why might compute NOT be the best answer to our challenges as software engineers? Why might a focus on compute scaling ultimately be inferior to something else?<p>I seek all kinds of answers, including ones about fundamental logic, mathematical physics, etc\n\n  I mean the entire tech industry is predicated on a continued exponential growth of computer power. It could be this 70 years and next couple dozen are a blip of what will be millennia of linear returns.\n\n  I mean I could baselessly argue that the second we have AGI, we will very shortly after have ASI, after which I think most computing could very likely be hundreds or thousands of times more efficient. It’s possible there exists far more computing power in the world than we will ever need.\n\n  If we focus on writing better software with performance in mind instead of this insane stack of abstraction disaster, we could easily get massive increases in compute capability with current hardware.<p>The most impressive thing about modern computing is that we&#x27;ve had exponential increase in compute speed, yet everything runs as slow as it did 30 years ago\n\n  These giant GPUs aren’t getting more efficient, they draw even more power to do more work. It’s impressive and will have important use cases.<p>But fundamentally technology gets better when we can do more with less.\n\n    They are getting more efficient. They draw say, 2x the power, but do 4x the work. The H100 is apparently ~5x more efficient than the A100.\n\n      Agreed, I need to describe this more precisely.<p>When it has to draw that much current it \nlimits the contexts in which it can be beneficial.\n\n    Ironically the power per cycle is decreasing - power and thermal dissipation are really the limits NVIDIA is exploring.  It’s what the software does with those cycles that is leaping exponentially.\n\n      The other bottleneck they are studiously exploring and minimizing is beachfront area and networking&#x2F;interconnect bandwidth.<p>Nvidia went all-in on infiniband serDES while AMD chose pcie&#x2F;CXL. But since Pcie signaling requirements are tighter, you need bigger stronger PHYs, which means you get less actual area per beachfront. The penalty is latency&#x2F;power, but who cares when gpus are latency-hiding machines anyway?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semianalysis.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;cxl-is-dead-in-the-ai-era\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semianalysis.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;cxl-is-dead-in-the-ai-era</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semianalysis.com&#x2F;nvidia-b100-b200-gb200-cogs-pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semianalysis.com&#x2F;nvidia-b100-b200-gb200-cogs-pri...</a><p><i>this</i> in turn means that nvidia can implement more links or bigger links in their nvswitch networks, which means they can construct bigger <i>systems</i> and push the TCO down.<p>Two 7900X is still functionally a 7900X, but two 3090s is functionally a 48GB card. Nvidia has got the interconnect bandwidth to a point where it’s a significant enough fraction of the local bandwidth to be functionally one single gpu - this is the same argument as MI300X etc. Doesn’t matter whether the link is on-package or off-package, what matters is that it’s a significant fraction of the speed of your local memory or cache ports. Nvidia did that, with large numbers of gpus, not just a pair of chiplets.<p>Nvidia has been thinking about this one for a long time - nvswitch is on its third generation, and can switch literal terabytes of data per switch, times several switches. The Mellanox purchase too, but it goes back way longer.<p>And unlike AMD they actually have a driver that works and just trivially exposes these capabilities and gets out of the way. If you want to tinker and build the open alternative that’s fine, other people want to work.<p>This is shocking to many AMD fanboys but actually Jensen is a good engineer too, nvidia is mostly on top because they sell products that people want (to such a relentless degree they get furious if they don’t get faster every year etc) and cannot be trivially displaced by “just as good” Radeon drivers etc - just see the latest installment of the geohot saga. Nobody is trapped by nvidia, it is a golden cage - getting actual work done or just going and playing a game instead of spending hours playing with regedit hacks to disable dxnavi to fix DX11 shader compilation stutter is what you’re buying.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;__tinygrad__&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770160392389771305\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;__tinygrad__&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770160392389771305</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;?q=Dxnavi+stutter+&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;?q=Dxnavi+stutter+&amp;include_ove...</a><p>Nvidia is on top because of relentlessly competent engineering and savant-level business direction, and as much as people scoff at the idea… that’s literally the reason you hate him lol.

People are also systematically unable to understand that apple users are not “trapped” or in need of rescuing either. People buy apple because it does what they want it to really well, and they don’t care about installing Linux on their phones. And nerds resent that deeply. It’s not a coincidence there’s this axis of warfare around both Nvidia  and the App Store with the EU etc. Nerds cannot abide someone choosing the “wrong” hardware. They are right and you <i>will</i> buy the same thing as them or they will get the EU to outlaw your product, or change the symbol licensing to prevent you running on Linux, etc.  If you don&#x27;t like the same filesystem as me, obviously that means I get to relicense some symbols that have been there for 20+ years and break your filesystem.  Btrfs is better, the council has spoken.<p>It keeps happening for a reason, folks, lol. Nerds can’t tolerate others making different choices. And those users disproportionately self-select to “nerd” platforms like android and AMD.\n\n  I would normally be tempted to think the S&amp;P500 should look linear or similar-ish to last year, and so on. But I think there&#x27;s a valid thesis where rapid technological advancement does indeed just grow the pie exponentially: where the amount of value that becomes unlocked in a non-zero-sum manner grows tremendously.<p>Just with current AI models, the amount of value that is waiting to be created (take technology X, add AI to it) is incredible. Casual things that used to take years for a team to build, can now be solved by throwing a GPU at it with a generic model that is fine-tuned a bit. Basically, things that were unpractical 2y ago are now on the table.<p>The bear thesis is that compute will stop being scarce. Which is plausible, since in capitalism, the best cure for high prices tends to be high prices.<p>Something crazy to think about is that Accelerando by Charles Stross is starting to look like a prophecy being slowly fulfilled.\n\n    The demand for compute increases dramatically as the functionality and reliability go up.\n\n      Yeah but the margins may go down, and a lot more players may enter the market.\n\n    Examples?\n\n      Oil?\n\n  Going to skip the &quot;fundamental logic, mathematical physics, etc&quot; angle and go with:<p>&quot;That AI isn&#x27;t all that that and won&#x27;t make much money&quot; seems to be by far the biggest one.  So far the applications are impressive and a little scary, but not actually something that anyone is going to pay for.  Apple makes a zillion dollars because people want its phones.  Google makes a zillion dollars because people want to sell junk to folks on the internet.<p>You need to posit a product built out of compute that does more.  Maybe replaces a bunch of existing workers in an existing industry, something like that.  So far the market is still looking.\n\n    &gt; You need to posit a product built out of compute that does more. Maybe replaces a bunch of existing workers in an existing industry, something like that. So far the market is still looking.<p>Although, even if that is the ultimate result, there&#x27;s still going to be plenty of money changing hands on the way to that conclusion. See also all the blockchain&#x2F;web3 companies, when there was (to me at least) clearly a lot less substance&#x2F;potential there.\n\n    At my work, I&#x27;m finding so many incredible things that GPT4 API can do to make my company run much more efficiently.<p>For example, being able to feed a potential customer&#x27;s invoice into GPT and ask it to see what kind of services we can offer to beat its price. Our sales people had to spend hours doing this before. Now it&#x27;s done in 2 minutes through an engineered prompt. And it&#x27;s incredibly accurate.<p>The problem with GPT4 API is context size and price. That&#x27;s it. Both are bottlenecked by faster and cheaper compute.<p>That&#x27;s my bull case for more compute, not bear case like OP asked.\n\n  Not sure about your definition of bearish, but concerned about the geopolitical risk of relying on this one company and their one supplier. In addition to everything else.<p>Also bearish on programmers keeping up on their fundamental algorithms, rather than trying to throw NNs at every problem.\n\n    &gt;Also bearish on programmers keeping up on their fundamental algorithms, rather than trying to throw NNs at every problem.<p>Besides interviews, at least 90% of developers have no need for &#x27;fundamental algorithms&#x27;. The library being used uses them in some way sure, but the vast majority of devs simply need to know how to use the tool, not how the tool itself is developed.\n\n      Eh, I wasn&#x27;t even referring to forgetting how to write bubble sort or hashmaps from scratch. But just being able to reason about different algorithmic solutions to a problem, and intuit something about their complexity and requirements.<p>Thinking back to a recent-ish discussion here about the (very elegant and efficient) algorithm behind Shazam, and some of the comments here being along the lines of &quot;haha, that&#x27;s so quaint, nowadays you could just use a neural net&quot;. Nevermind how that would even work as well.<p>Or programmers excited about neural networks forgoing the much simpler, and in many cases completely sufficient, computer vision algorithms built into OpenCV, in favor of trying to train their own model from scratch.\n\n      This attitude is how we get stuff like the GTA V O(n^2) JSON deserialization bug. I get it, nobody is implementing quicksort on a day-to-day basis, but being taught the ideas behind these algorithms is important for building mental models.\n\n        If the GTA bug was anything but just bad programming, it was a dev trying to implement their own JSON parser. It&#x27;s said as much in the analysis that the JSON parser was simply poor, they could have just used any of the already existing JSON parsers.<p>And the other smaller problem was using a hash array instead of a hash map. You don&#x27;t really need a mental model of multiple algorithms to know o(1) is faster than o(n).<p>The whole thing is more of a sign of how poor coding practices must have been at Rockstar for such a bug to not only make it in, but persist for years.\n\n  I think eventually AMD and other players are going to mive in with force and we will see a surplus of supply in a few years, especially when China starts to spit out a lower end version of...everything.\n\n    Nvidia is too big. China could not easily get away with spinning complete rip offs that even support CUDA without poking a hole in their hull. Nvidia is working very hard to placate China. If China does go down this route, it&#x27;ll be for China-only for a considerable time. Nvidia can afford to placate China and avoid that scenario, should their economics continue to trend upwards, practically forever.\n\n  When we don’t have a model of the problem it takes enormous amounts of power to synthesize one out of neurons or another general function approximating primitive.<p>But once we understand a little bit about the problem we can model 80-90% of its behavior with a handful of parameters. Add in some bias and noise parameters and you have an accurate trainable machine learning model that’s orders of magnitude more efficient.<p>Take for example a spring which can be modeled by 1 or 2 parameters. But its impulse response looks like a sin curve multiple by exponential decay.<p>If you just train neurons to match input&#x2F;outputs from a spring you need a ridiculous number of model parameters to describe that shape.<p>CNNS have seen an enormous amount of success due to this fact: a lot of processes can be modeled by convolution.\n\n  The bear case:<p>1) AGI won&#x27;t happen because we are on the wrong path<p>2) AI being a big part of our lives is still a theory. Aswath Damodaran has some brief thoughts on this.<p>But the biggest bear case has to be that the technology won&#x27;t get better. Essentially, everyone assumes that it will without reservations.\n\n  &gt; what’s the bear thesis here?<p>Nvidia is ceding the low-end GPU market to anyone who wants it.  Not only does it allow a competitor to establish a reliable source of revenue for their R&amp;D department, but it could cut off the sale of the binned chips that are inevitably produced on the expensive, tiny processes that Nvidia uses - which would hurt their margins to some degree.\n\n    <i>Innovators Dilemma</i> seems strong on this one. Except typically the flight upmarket is driven by competition below. In this case Nvidia isn&#x27;t being driven upmarket, the profits are just too tempting focusing on upmarket &amp; there&#x27;s not much competition downmarket.\n\n    &quot;obviously chevy is just ceding the low-end market to anyone willing to make a camaro for the price of a camry, just think of all the profit waiting for anyone willing to establish themselves in this market&quot;<p>bro there is like $10 of margin in your idea for a $200 gpu lol, nobody is &quot;ceding&quot; anything (actually 4060 is a more advanced card than 7600 on literally every front, for ~10% more money) but the cost floor has climbed to the point where $200-300 gpus just don&#x27;t progress that much anymore.<p>There&#x27;s very good reasons for this - shrinks are the least effective on low-tier cards (because memory controllers don&#x27;t shrink), and you simply don&#x27;t gain much actual savings from shrinking a 200mm2 die - congrats it&#x27;s 150mm2 now, on a more expensive node, meaning your $10 chip is now $9.  And meanwhile gamers want more VRAM every year, manufacturing and testing and shipping costs have gone up (and cost the same for a 4090 as a 4060), etc.  The economics of low-end cards is literally terrible and they are simply falling off the edge of profitability.<p>Intel is willing to lose money hand-over-fist just to get into the market, but AMD and NVIDIA are pretty much charging fair-ish prices, and gamers just are too emotionally immature to accept that moore&#x27;s law really really actually is dead for realsies and things aren&#x27;t going to progress 40% perf&#x2F;$ per gen anymore.<p>It&#x27;s so weird, nobody cries about the CPU market like this.  A 1600AF went for $85, a 3600 went for $160, nobody said &quot;boo&quot; when the 5600X increased that to $330 or whatever.  Nowadays you are spending <i>at least</i> 50% more on your CPU than you did 5 years ago, sometimes closer to 2x.  The enthusiast market is buying $250-400 cpus now, not $85-160. And obviously everyone understands that upgrading your CPU every gen is terrible value too, especially when prices have drifted upwards.  But they don&#x27;t have a half-decade of <i>negging</i> from reviewers telling them that this is a <i>market in crisis</i>, and that they should feel bad about buying a CPU, etc.<p>The literal half-decade of warfare from reviewers against the GPU market is so tired at this point.  Bro, things <i>are</i> going to slow down, it just is how it is.  GPUs are the processor that&#x27;s <i>most dependent</i> on moore&#x27;s law providing growth in transistors <i>at the same cost</i>, and wafer price increases hit them the hardest.  Go complain to TSMC instead, or ASML, or the brick wall - it&#x27;s ultimately a physics problem.  But there&#x27;s a hell of a lot of clicks and youtube ad money to be made whining about it in the meantime.<p>At least reviewers are finally coming to jesus on DLSS - mostly because they know AMD will finally have a decent upscaler within a year tops, and that RDNA4&#x2F;5 will be pushing forward on tensor etc.  The writing was on the wall as soon the specs leaked for PS5 Pro, which is basically adopting RTX features wholesale.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CbJYtixMUgI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CbJYtixMUgI</a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BG-7vyw2YRg&amp;t=1625s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BG-7vyw2YRg&amp;t=1625s</a>\n\n  &gt; Why might a focus on compute scaling ultimately be inferior to something else?<p>a) Humans at some point between here and eternity become more efficient easier, than scaling compute is hard. Seems unlikely.<p>b) Compute is overrated, now or will be in the near future. I will be happy to donate to the church of &quot;compute is overrated&quot; if that makes people get off of gpt-4+ and let me cook. Read that as: I doubt it.<p>I don&#x27;t see a c)\n\n  I think we can be certain that AGI will be compute intensive. Something Ilya Sutskever said made that clear. If you only have a small model, there&#x27;s logically not much you can do with it. You can represent a single edge of an object, maybe. But it&#x27;s not enough capacity to represent multiple edges and how they mix together to form an object. And if it can&#x27;t do that, then it has no representations it can use for reasoning.<p>There&#x27;s still the secondary question of <i>how</i> compute heavy it will be, and I don&#x27;t think anyone knows. But Sam Altman, in a recent speech he gave in Korea, expressed confidence that there isn&#x27;t a limit in sight for returns from GPT scaling.\n\n  I&#x27;m absolutely not going to short Nvidia stock, but it&#x27;s plausible that they&#x27;re overvalued.<p>Nvidia GPUs are pretty flexible in terms of computation and extremely power hungry.  It may be that a next generation of more specialized hardware, such as TPUs or something, outperforms Nvidia GPUs on machine learning tasks to such an extent that those GPUs are obsolete for those tasks.  This next generation could come to market sooner than Nvidia anticipates.<p>Another possibility is that ML researchers figure out some ways to radically reduce the amount of compute required for good training and inference on _less_ specialized hardware.  It&#x27;s really impressive what you can do with llama.cpp.  If open source models running on consumer grade hardware ever get to 90% as good as ChatGPT (which, to be clear, is absolutely not the case currently), then those top end GPUs are overkill for most use cases.<p>I don&#x27;t think either of those scenarios is particularly likely, but they&#x27;re at least plausible.\n\n    &gt; Another possibility is that ML researchers figure out some ways to radically reduce the amount of compute required for good training and inference on _less_ specialized hardware<p>just like the creation of radically simpler internal combustion engines led to us spending a lot less on internal combustion engines, right? &#x2F;s\n\nHonestly, idk what that means.\nIs it a 4xxx successor?\nWhat&#x27;s the point? Why, as a consumer who likes playing video games, do I have to buy a &quot;GPU&quot; that isn&#x27;t primarily a GPU?\nMaybe I&#x27;m getting old\n\n  I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. You don&#x27;t have to buy this GPU and it&#x27;s clearly not geared towards gaming any more than the A100 was.\n\nIs Nvidia using AI to help design new GPUs? When that happens we&#x27;re actually off to the singularity. Until then, I can&#x27;t tell if we&#x27;re in a bit of hype mode.\n\n  Explained here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HxyM2Chu9Vc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HxyM2Chu9Vc</a><p>Quite interesting.\n\n    iirc also discussed a bit here as well <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JXb1n0OrdeI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JXb1n0OrdeI</a>\n\nWith an &quot;OS&quot; to go along with it,<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;products&#x2F;ai-enterprise&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;products&#x2F;ai-enterpr...</a><p>It is this kind of delivery that the competition misses out.\n\n  I imagine that Nvidia is trying to build a more sustainable moat. If the only things they have that their competitors don’t are a nice development framework, nice libraries and nice drivers, it’s not <i>that</i> hard for a customer to get their software working on a competing hardware platform and cut out a bunch of Nvidia’s enormous markup. But if Nvidia also strong buy-in with datacenter operators and an entire platform to magically run people’s applications without having them need to think about how they’re deployed, then they can try for an AWS-like moat in which customers want to avoid the ongoing cost of DIYing their stack.\n\n    Assuming that the hardware isn&#x27;t a moat because other people make similar hardware is a mistake.<p>The networking alone is a huge bottleneck at scale. A competitor has to be better at networking AND chips to be competitive.\n\n    Tiny corp&#x2F;tinygrad has been working for a year+ and has raised something like $5 million dollars to try to get AMD chips up to speed to Nvidia, without much success.  Check out twitter where George Hotz has been very vocal about AMD needing to open source their chips to allow someone to help them get up to speed.\n\n      Consumer AMD chips to be precise. AMD is mostly focusing on their datacenter chips (MI300X), and I assume the support for AI workloads there is much better. They might even see their consumer chip undermining sales of datacenter chips.<p>NVIDIA got big because CUDA works on the most crappy notebook GPUs up to their most powerful chips, and AMD should do the same, but focusing their limited number of driver devs on the expensive enterprise hardware makes sense IMHO.\n\n      I’m a bit surprised AMD hasn’t purchased tinygrad. Or funded or supported them.  Or really made any serious move here.\n\n        I think moving geohotz closer to the levers of power and into places where he can see even more sensitive information to squawk on twitter&#x2F;github probably is the exact opposite of how AMD wants to handle the situation.<p>AI&#x2F;ML is a rapidly moving field etc and you know geohot is gonna leak it all on twitter as soon as there&#x27;s anything to announce, which makes it far more difficult for them to pivot later, etc.\n\n      Yes, he was first like, we&#x27;re totally doing this on AMD! A few weeks later he&#x27;s like wtf@#! this is the buggiest thing ever\n\n    &quot;it’s not that hard for a customer to get their software working on a competing hardware platform and cut out a bunch of Nvidia’s enormous markup&quot;<p>Agree and yet none of the contenders were able to work out their software play (Intel, AMD, chip startups) for more than a year which shows how corporates move slow.<p>Google is not selling their TPUs AFAIK and their tooling is completely focused on internal use.<p>So really interesting to see no one else is properly addressing the need even though they have chips (and the chip itself is much simpler than a cpu, a systolic matrix multiplier array).\n\n      I’m not taking about the chip suppliers moving fast.  I’m talking about the <i>users</i>.  For example, here’s Stability pulling it off:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stability.ai&#x2F;news&#x2F;putting-the-ai-supercomputer-to-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stability.ai&#x2F;news&#x2F;putting-the-ai-supercomputer-to-wo...</a><p>I’m sure this was a lot of work, and Intel surely helped a lot, and there are probably plenty of kludges involved. But it <i>worked</i>, and there’s a lot of money on the table to do things like this.\n\n  I&#x27;m very vocal about this to the point where the naive&#x2F;cursory view is that I&#x27;m an &quot;Nvidia fanboy&quot;. It&#x27;s amazing how many times I&#x27;ve had to try to relate this point and how much hate I get for it - Nvidia is lightyears ahead of AMD and the overall ROCm ecosystem in terms of software support. AMD makes fantastic hardware but at the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t do anything without software. This is very obvious and very basic.<p>CUDA will do whatever you want and it more-or-less just works. ROCm (after &gt; six years) is still:<p>- Won&#x27;t work on your hardware<p>- Used to work on your hardware but we removed support within a few years<p>- Burn 10x more time trying to get something to work<p>- Be perpetually behind CUDA in terms of what you want&#x2F;need to do<p>- Sorry, that just won&#x27;t work<p>- Performance is lower than it should be for what is often actually better hardware, to the point where a superior newer generation AMD GPU gets bested by a previous generation Nvidia GPU with inferior (on paper) hardware specs<p>I&#x27;ve been trying ROCm since it was initially released &gt; six years ago. I want AMD to succeed - I&#x27;ve purchased every new generation of AMD GPU in these six years to evaluate the suitability of AMD&#x2F;ROCm for my workloads. Once a quarter or so I check back in to evaluate ROCm.<p>Every. Single. Time. I come away laughing&#x2F;shaking my head at how abysmal it is. Then I go back to CUDA and sit in wonder at how well it actually works and throw even more money at Nvidia because I just need get things done and my concerns about their monopoly, artificial market segmentation, ridiculously high margins, etc are a distant second to my livelihood.<p>AMD (and others) need to understand what Jensen Huang has been saying for years - 30% of their development spend is on software. As the announcements this week show, Nvidia is using their greater and greater financial resources and market share to continue to lap AMD in the only thing people actually care about: here&#x27;s our product and here&#x27;s what you can actually do with it.<p>Many people with a fundamental hate&#x2F;disgust for Nvidia will come back and say &quot;ok bootlicker, it&#x27;s supported in torch you&#x27;re spreading FUD&quot;. Ok, take a look at the Nvidia platform you linked and show me where the ROCm equivalent is. Take a look at inference serving platforms which are one of the things I care most about. Look at flash attention, alibi, and the countless other software components that you actually need beyond torch in many cases. Watch even basic torch crash all over the place with ROCm.<p>Sure, you &#x2F;might&#x2F; be able to train or run local one-off inference with AMD. How do I actually run this thing for my users? Crickets -or- maybe vLLM support for ROCm for LLMs (nothing for other models). Then dig just a little bit deeper and realize even vLLM isn&#x27;t feature complete, requires patches, specific versions all around, and from personal experience a lot of github&#x2F;blog spelunking and pain. With CUDA it&#x27;s `docker run` and flies.<p>With CUDA I can run torchserve, HF TGI, vLLM, Triton, and a number of others to actually serve models up for users so I can make money from my work. ROCm, meanwhile, can barely run local experiments.<p>AMD needs to get it together.\n\nBut Can It Run Crysis?<p>(seriously though, don&#x27;t call it a &quot;GPU&quot; when rendering takes the back seat)\n\nI guess Blackwell is too late in the design cycle to use N3. It would be interesting to see, at these sort of margin and volume. Would it make sense to have GPU on latest node? Next Gen 3nm GPU in 2025 and if they could move aggressively 2nm GPU in 2026.\n\nLots more discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39749646\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39749646</a>\n\nI&#x27;m sure it will be a very impressive part but the performance claims sound too good to be true.<p>&quot;up to 30 times the inference performance, and up to 25 times better energy efficiency&quot;\n\n  Mostly marketing shenanigans.\n\nDoes anyone know the numbers in layman&#x27;s terms regarding the demand for compute and what our systems&#x2F;chips are able to reasonably process with this new tech?<p>I&#x27;m curious if the technology is now vastly out preforming the demand here or if the demand for compute is outpacing the tech.\n\n  Demand is infinite"

It&#x27;s helpful to include relevant error messages to precisely explain what a future developer needs to do.\n\n&gt; The perfect solution to this problem is creating a script that automatically adds a new app to all the relevant places and stuffing it into a Justfile, but that&#x27;s a pretty big piece of work that requires thought and error handling and a whole slew of other stuff. Instead, it&#x27;s comparatively easy to just capture these constraints in a test:<p>Just write the goddamn script. You can put comments in that too. Not saying it shouldn&#x27;t have tests but the solution to bunch of steps that need to be done always, and in same, easy to automate way is not &quot;make sure the checklist is always there so other people waste the optimum amount of time on it&quot;.\n\n  Another thing that came to mind: do-nothing scripting[0].<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29083367\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29083367</a>\n\n  But then no one adds an app for a few months, during which the requirements change but the script isn&#x27;t updated. Then it fails and someone who wasn&#x27;t there when it was written is off in the weeds trying to sherlock the reason this thing exists in the first place and how to update it, making their minor change seem much larger &amp; riskier to reviewers. Or worse it doesn&#x27;t fail, but the incomplete run introduces a defect no one is looking for.<p>You simply can&#x27;t make judgements about what should be done to a codebase from a distance in the abstract like this. Sometimes you should write the script, sometimes you shouldn&#x27;t. You need specific knowledge of the circumstances to exercise good judgement about it which we certainly don&#x27;t have from this comment section.\n\n&gt; pytest.ini, so tests are run;<p>Seems weird to me. I don&#x27;t have to add anything to this file when I add an app to my Django projects. How did you end up there?<p>&gt; pyproject.toml, so files are linted;<p>This too. Same comment as above.<p>&gt; modules.txt, so metrics are exported.<p>I don&#x27;t know what this is. Sounds like something specific to your code base?\n\nIf you&#x27;re able to automate a script for it, or make tests for it, it&#x27;s not tacit knowledge.<p>Also, as someone else has said, why not just automate the prcoess?  Why spend the time to write a test when that time could be spent on the automation and saving everyone&#x27;s time in the future?\n\n  There was a code quality tool (Snyk) which had a blog post [citation needed] about focusing fixes on only recently changed files.  eg: You start adopting Snyk, it starts complaining about a bunch of stuff (&quot;ERR: Too much whitespace in if statement...&quot; or whatever), and you _would_ like to conform to that, but it&#x27;s a massive undertaking to modify your whole codebase to support it.  To be clear: much of the results from Snyk are actual functional issues, I&#x27;m just throwing out an overly simplistic example.<p>Anyway, their blog post mentioned something like &quot;fix the tip of the wave, not the ocean&quot;, and that metaphor has stayed with me ever since.<p>Internally in your codebase, you may have `TheDatabase.GetUsers(...)`, and want to migrate to something like `PerformantShardingV2.GetSomeUsers(...)`.  It&#x27;s a perfect example of where something like this technique would work.<p>You would&#x2F;could&#x2F;should use code to `grep -l TheDatabase.GetUsers` and get a list of filenames _known_ to use the old-and-busted way of doing things.  You would&#x2F;could&#x2F;should have a test that says &quot;ERR: $new_filename uses TheDatabase, but is not pre-approved, use PerformantShardingV2 instead!&quot;.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;d be great if there was a way to say something like: &quot;ERR: Your PR modified files that use `TheDatabase` but you didn&#x27;t migrate to `PerformantShardingV2`, please upgrade!&quot;.<p>Long way of saying: the technique is incredibly useful for gradual (not big-bang) changes&#x2F;rewrites, which is mostly what you should be doing.  Standards, compliance, and best-practices do tend to change and skew over time, and having a technique like this is very valuable.<p>Why you wouldn&#x27;t have `just make-a-new-enum-json` as you&#x27;re suggesting? It isn&#x27;t very discoverable (unless you have a VERY good business vocabulary and constant training) and if you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;d need to use it then you wouldn&#x27;t have used it in the first place.  Additionally, you&#x27;d <i>still</i> want to have this double-checker to prevent errors or standards&#x2F;best-practices violations from getting in to your codebase.<p>This _is_ automation that saves everyone&#x27;s time in the future, and is complementary to some of the automation that you&#x27;re talking about.\n\n  Practically all knowledge was once tacit knowledge. I bet protohumans found fire from a lightning strike long before they figured out how to make it themselves.<p>Even the idea of a city, say London, is just a non-tacit version of the idea of the area where London is."

      "conversation_text": "Stability always seemed like a dark horse thanks to the reputation of their founder and their open source business model. I do get some schadenfreude from seeing them like this considering the damage many feel they&#x27;ve done to the art community.<p>E: -4 in 10 minutes. Stay classy hackernews. I hope this company and OpenAI choke on the algorithmic disgorgement when the law catches up.\n\n  The entire AI industry is powered by piracy at a massive scale. Very little training data is properly licensed or compensated. It&#x27;s just more obvious with open models because we can investigate them. Closed models are sausages and we don&#x27;t know what went in.<p>Download a movie and you can get sued or your Internet connection terminated, but pirate the entire collective output of humanity and sell it back to us from behind a paywall and that&#x27;s fine.<p>I have more sympathy for Stability here because at least they opened the models. IMHO models trained on not-properly-licensed (pirated) data should <i>at the very least</i> not be copyrightable and should be public domain. (These piracy enterprises are aware of this as a possible legal outcome in some jurisdictions, so the whole AI safety bullshit performance is an attempt to scare people about open models to head off the potential of questionably-trained models being declared uncopyrightable and forced to be released.)\n\n    &gt; Very little training data is properly licensed or compensated.<p>Could it ever be the case, I wonder, if we could trust&#x2F;enforce&#x2F;believe that a model had so abstracted what it learned from the training inputs such that the model was not a derived work from them?<p>I&#x27;ve seen the examples where the model is able to reproduce recognizable characters from popular media.  Those look like they might be &quot;just&quot; overfitting?  While I can see that as desirable from the point of view of being able to create a picture of &quot;Robocop shopping for diapers&quot;.  But maybe we could compromise and converge to a point where AI art isn&#x27;t quite so demonized and instead is seen as a useful tool.\n\n      They could at least make an effort to purchase licenses from all non-open content, comply with open licenses, and exclude content otherwise. They aren&#x27;t making anything more than the most lame token effort because they don&#x27;t care.\n\n        But that&#x27;s just it - if we believe that what the model learns from the training material is abstract enough, they <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> license the content at all.  Humans learn from and are inspired by art all the time.  They create new works that are not considered derived works, despite there being obvious influence.  Could we conceive of the same circumstance being possible with machine learning?\n\n          If we go down this road right now, we are allowing superintelligent AI powered corporations to front-run the entire human race and sell everything we think back to us.<p>It&#x27;s not about theory of mind stuff. It&#x27;s about just compensation of living human beings.\n\n            1848 had a publication that might interest you.<p>I think the manifesto is missing some important aspects about game theory and human nature, and for some of that theory of mind is indeed very important, and that&#x27;s why this particular political experiment didn&#x27;t work out in the end despite the good intentions and that several aspects have become globally accepted.\n\n              I’ve read it but I think this case is much more unambiguous. Workers are paid; Marx would argue they are systematically underpaid and disempowered.<p>In this case the workers are not paid at all. Their work is not even acknowledged. It’s closer to cultural appropriation but quite a bit more unambiguous than that as well since this isn’t people learning from people. This is mass uncompensated value harvesting.<p>The number of hands benefiting here are incredibly tiny. In theory you could have one human owning the entire human mind and renting it back. This is the danger of present generation AI, not Skynet scenarios, and it anything the sci-fi stuff distracts us from this.<p>It’s like an information theory equivalent of today’s shoplifting epidemic except there are tiny gangs of only a few shoplifters able to run at Mach 10 and shoplift from every store in the country in days.\n\n            Well, with the status quo, there&#x27;s no license required to train on the greatest works of art from centuries past.<p>I recognize some of the concerns about AI but I don&#x27;t think pinning hopes on copyright law will deliver anything remotely resembling a remedy to the problems you bring up.\n\n              Are you talking about training a human or training an artist?<p>Downloading copyrighted data at huge scales to use in your commercial software product is pretty substantially different than an art student studying a reference.\n\n                &gt; Are you talking about training a human or training an artist?<p>Neither: I am talking about training a machine learning model.  Unless that&#x27;s what you meant by &quot;artist&quot;?<p>&gt; Downloading copyrighted data at huge scales to use in your commercial software product is pretty substantially different than an art student studying a reference.<p>You may have misunderstood my comment.  My comment was stating that there&#x27;s only a portion of human art - the most recent decades of works - which are protected by a copyright.  Models like Stable Diffusion could be re-trained instead on centuries of artworks and not infringe at all.  So the problem described as &quot;AI powered corporations to front-run the entire human race and sell everything we think back to us&quot; - this problem is here regardless of whether licenses were purchased.\n\n                  You&#x27;re right on both counts. Things are a bit fraught in this thread so I apologize for misunderstanding you.\n\n      I think it&#x27;s obviously problematic that these companies are deriving value from millions of people without compensating them, while creating a product that competes with those masses.\n\n        You are describing the original meaning of &quot;cultural appropriation&quot;, like when jazz and rock &amp; roll were copied from Black American culture and sold.\n\n          I am describing &quot;copyright infringement&quot;\n\n        If you are selling something, and no one is buying it, the value you have generated is zero. If you put something online and you did not bother to understand this material can potentially be used by a third-party on account of its loose licensing, then who&#x27;s to blame?\n\n          But the licensing <i>isn&#x27;t</i> loose in many (most?) cases we&#x27;re aware of. Merely making an image publicly available online doesn&#x27;t give the viewers rights to do whatever they want with it under our copyright laws.\n\n            Well, I suppose the keyword here is &quot;most?&quot; because the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, the legal gymnastics of coming up a reasonable argument to this will be interesting.\n\n    &gt;and sell it back to us from behind a paywall and that&#x27;s fine.<p>That&#x27;s the sticking point. If it&#x27;s an open tool for humanity&#x27;s benefit being created given back to us, that&#x27;s one thing... but to sell it back to us...<p>With that said, piracy is close to what&#x27;s happening... but I think we should be careful classifying where&#x2F;what exactly is the matter. I reason I think that matter&#x27;s lies may be down the end of a slippery slope, or it may be straight ahead of us... the future is hard to know. If we classify it poorly we may unintentionally cause human(post&#x2F;trans-human) right&#x27;s issues {if I upload my consciousness to a digital mind, I don&#x27;t want archaic laws to dominate what I can see&#x2F;compute based on the material of which I&#x27;m made}.\n\n      These companies need to make money because they took VC money and training these things take 10s if not 100s of millions of dollars.<p>Also nice to see the complete nonsense of digital mind uploading on hackernews vis a vis this discussion. If that happens we&#x27;d need to change a lot of laws anyway.\n\n        The mind uploading is just one of many potential outcomes.<p>To me the more interesting concern: we can&#x27;t seem to agree on the bare minimum requirements for sentience&#x2F;experience. Maybe the &#x27;bare minimum&#x27; is &#x27;electricity runs through it&#x27;. It may be that these LL&#x2F;SD&#x2F;ML models are having an &#x27;experience&#x27; without the proper memory&#x2F;state&#x2F;internal-control to achieve sentience&#x2F;consciousness.<p>Law&#x27;s need to change, that&#x27;s for sure (look at copyright).<p>And taking VC money to do anything Open seems like a trap. There are government grants... but yeah... there exists a whole host of (related or similar) problems in that.\n\n          Thought crime in 2084: the name given for a crime for which the only evidence is a scan of your brain.<p>e.g. &quot;You imagined someone naked! That&#x27;s a non-consensual deepfake of intimate personal imagery!&quot;\n\n    &gt; IMHO models trained on not-properly-licensed (pirated) data should at the very least not be copyrightable and should be public domain.<p>My understanding is that ML model weights cannot be copyrighted as an original creative work. They are trade-secrets and protected through contracts but once leaked to third parties it’s not a copyright violation to use&#x2F;distribute.<p>Whether the model is actually a derivative work of the training data is another interesting question.<p>Or is my theory off here?\n\n      The main argument I have seen (which is also OpenAI&#x27;s in their legal briefs) is that it is fair use.  The idea of &quot;fair use&quot; is that you are conceding that you are infringing by creating a derivative work, but it&#x27;s still okay.  Implied in the fair use argument is that it is a derivative work.\n\n        &gt; Implied in the fair use argument is that it is a derivative work.<p>You can get all LLMs to spit out almost exact copies of known IP visuals from movies and games. For instance, with Dalle-E and Midjourney, it&#x27;s relatively easy to get similar pictures from film and game studios. Those are copies with minor changes. It would be hard to argue otherwise in court. The same happens with ChatGPT spitting out verbatim passages from New York Times articles.\n\n    &gt; The entire AI industry is powered by piracy at a massive scale.<p>Forget about AI.  Instead it is almost the entire art industry, wholesale!<p>The semi-professional online art commissioning market is almost entirely copyright infringing fan art works, being sold without permission of IP owner.<p>Yes, fan art is infringing.  Especially when it is sold.  And if you go to a convention center, to the artists section, you will see that over half of the booths are straight up selling other people&#x27;s IP without permission.<p>This is the case for conventions, online art commissions, etsy&#x2F;handmade items, all of it.<p>Its all illegal, all infringing, and the only reason why anyone cares now is because someone else can do the same thing that others have been doing for decades, but quicker and cheaper.\n\n      I&#x27;m perfectly fine with getting rid of AI... if all fan artists paid the statutory and actual damages for their infringing activities.\n\n        What actual damages are there for fan art?  Can you prove that work done by a fan artist would otherwise have been done by the original creator and that fan artists are costing sales of the original works they create fan art for?\n\n      I&#x27;m glad someone brought this up. Artists, especially fan artists, will only hurt themselves if they advocate for classifying transformative works as infringing. Fan art has been so normalised that people have forgotten that it used to be considered legally dubious. Better to advocate for reskilling and social safety nets; automation affects everyone, not just them.\n\n        Fair use has 4 factors.  Transformative is one of them.  Recently, courts have gotten <i>much</i> more interested in a different factor, the &quot;commercial intent&quot; factor.  While fan art is less transformative than AI training, it&#x27;s not commercial and it&#x27;s not competing with the original work (if anything, it enhances the market for the original work).  Generative AI models are both commercial products and very successful competitors with the original works they used for training.\n\n          &gt;  it&#x27;s not commercial and it&#x27;s not competing with the original work<p>Yes it is and yes it does.<p>&quot;Fan art&quot; is &quot;fan&quot; in name only.<p>If you read back on my original post, you will see that I am talking about almost the entire online professional art commissions market.<p>From online, to convention centers, and more.<p>All of this is commerical and all of this competed with the IP owners.<p>People just sell other people&#x27;s IP in all of these places.\n\n    &gt; questionably-trained models being declared uncopyrightable and forced to be released<p>I think uncopyrightable is a likely outcome, but where are you coming up with forced to be released?\n\n    &gt; The entire AI industry is powered by piracy<p>Just like all art. When you draw something you don&#x27;t cite every single thing you&#x27;ve seen and experienced in life that inspired your drawing and style. Nor did you own or pay royalties to all that inspiration either.\n\n      &gt;<i>When you draw something you don&#x27;t cite every single thing you&#x27;ve seen and experienced in life that inspired your drawing and style.</i><p>Oh please. There is an astounding degree of nuance and context missed in your example here.\n\n        I&#x27;m kind of down to let people follow this dead end reasoning since it&#x27;s legally irrelevant. Makes it much easier to disregard.\n\n    If there is a model which is, for the sake of the argument, <i>absolutely definitely and unambiguously powered by piracy at a massive scale</i>, then the act of <i>forcing it to be released</i> is going to <i>necessarily</i> entail <i>all of the possible harms from that specific act of IP piracy</i>.<p>IMO, if a model is deemed to be such, all copies of that model should be destroyed. Actual copyright law allows for the destruction of equipment used for copyright infringement, and those laws were written in the days where this meant &quot;a printing press&quot;.<p>&gt; the whole AI safety bullshit performance<p>The people who care about AI safety have been loudly warning about it for so much longer than these companies and models have existed, that they roll their eyes at newspapers using stock photos from <i>Terminator</i> to illustrate the discussion.<p>&gt; The entire AI industry<p>Also includes self-driving cars, spam filters, medical diagnosis tools, …\n\n    &gt;The entire AI industry is powered by piracy at a massive scale.<p>ARRRRR..<p>This is a grey area still for me. It&#x27;s a neural network. It works similar to our brains work, but more consistent. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem like piracy to me. If an artist was really into Salvidor Dali, and happened to imitate his surrealist style, it would not be considered piracy. In fact, this is how art has evolved over the centuries. Each relevant artist in the past has incrementally contributed to what we call art today.<p>I feel like the people unwilling to accept that AI may impact their career are more worried about putting food on the table than anything else, which is very understandable, but it&#x27;s just the cost of progress.<p>The bigger problem we need to deal with is how to retrain and provide job placement who are affected by disruptive technologies. We&#x27;ve really failed the public on this in the past and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth nerfing emerging tech just to keep people employed. This is not the first or last time this has happened, and it&#x27;s going to be more frequent as technology advances.\n\n      &gt; It&#x27;s a neural network. It works similar to our brains work, but more consistent.<p>Irrelevant and incorrect.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem like piracy to me.<p>It&#x27;s pretty indisputably piracy, whether or not it&#x27;s legal&#x2F;fair use&#x2F;whatever. Many of the training sets included material like the books3 corpus which was downloaded to a server somewhere.

It&#x27;s clear this community isn&#x27;t open to critical views on this topic.\n\n      Maybe this community is more open to objective analysis of the articles that are shared, and no so much of passional arguments that benefit no one.\n\n        Okay. Objectively, there are several ongoing lawsuits regarding this technology and its use of unlicensed data. Fair use is not as clear cut a case as many here would have you believe, and that&#x27;s the opinion of many lawyers. Nilay Patel of the verge, who has a law degree, had a conversation about this with another lawyer on his podcast recently and it seems like the legal community is much less hopeful about it than people whose paycheck might rely on this technology.\n\n      1. It’s not just this community<p>2. It’s not just “critical views” it’s any view that deviates from the velocity or acceleration of the norm<p>3. Don’t take it personally, votes aren’t about what you said they’re about how the voter feels after having read it\n\n      Or maybe they are just not sure how making things open to everyone can make someone a &quot;dark horse&quot;.\n\n        Defining dark horse: &quot;a candidate or competitor about whom little is known but who unexpectedly wins or succeeds.&quot;<p>Compared to Altman, Emad Mostaque is a relative nobody and a somewhat controversial figure at the head of what is apparently one of the frontrunners of the AI industry. Additionally, releasing the model, something that was I assume very capital intensive to create, is definitely a bold business strategy, and not one we&#x27;ve seen succeed yet despite the popularity of Stability&#x27;s models and its derivatives within the open source ai community.\n\n  The &quot;art community&quot; did most of the damage to itself.\n\n    To expand upon this, the majority of the complaints I see are coming from the online community where the largest part of the material seems to be based of IP&#x2F;copyright violation by the artists.  I&#x27;ve been part of multiple communities who have decided to ban AI art because of a moral clause against using other&#x27;s peoples works without their permission, but yet which don&#x27;t like having it pointed out that the IP holders have withheld their permission of their characters being used for unlicensed artwork.<p>While some of this are people practicing their artwork and I don&#x27;t see any reason we should care what artwork someone practices on, this is also the general trend for artwork being sold.  Go to any convention where artists sell work and look at how much artwork is sold of characters the artists do not have license to.  While I think one can take a philosophical stance against the current IP laws that outlaw this, such a stance would make it quite hard to oppose the use of content in training an AI.<p>In short, if those making the AI stole IP to train the AI, it was stolen from a community that was fine with IP theft that benefitted them.  And if the claim is that it wasn&#x27;t IP theft because the law was generally tolerating it (as long as no one became so much a target they received a C&amp;D), then unless there are some lawsuits won against the AI it would be equally allowed.<p>(And of course individuals will have their own philosophical stances which might be much more consistent, I&#x27;m speaking of the generalized view I have developed from overall interactions with parts of the community and as such it is not meant to be strongly prescriptive to any specific member of the community).\n\n      &gt; the largest part of the material seems to be based of IP&#x2F;copyright violation by the artists<p>What do you mean by this?  Fan art is pretty well known to be fair use, particularly because it is transformative and it has no <i>commercial intent</i>.  AI training is transformative alright, but the commercial intent part is a huge factor in the analysis.  The fair use analysis is very much not clear at this point.\n\n        &gt;   it has no commercial intent.<p>Under what possible analysis does art sold at a convention, by full time professional artists, not count as being done for a commercial purpose?\n\n          Does this actually happen at large scale without the permission of the owner of the IP?<p>I can see someone making a few hundred bucks with their fan art, but doing tens of thousands of dollars of business is a different story.<p>The main commercial factor (per the courts - see the recent Warhol lawsuit) is whether the derivative work competes in the market with the original work.  I sincerely doubt that even if there is large-scale selling of fan art at conventions, that fan art is meaningfully competing with (ie reducing) the market for the original IP.\n\n            &gt; Does this actually happen at large scale<p>Yes?<p>Go to any convention center.  Go commission a piece of art on the internet.<p>It is almost all infringing &quot;fan art&quot;.<p>&gt; I can see someone making a few hundred bucks with their fan art<p>Its not some rando person doing this stuff for a hobby. Instead, I am talking about the entire industry.<p>All you&#x27;d have to do is go to any gaming&#x2F;media&#x2F;comic convention and this is immediately obvious.<p>&gt; that fan art is meaningfully competing with (ie reducing) the market for the original IP.<p>I mean, ok?  Then if thats your metric, then you can&#x27;t complain about the entire open source industry of people making AI art on their home PCs.<p>If you are giving that gigantic, large hole to slip through, then you have now allowed almost the entire open source AI art industry to exist.\n\n              &gt; All you&#x27;d have to do is go to any gaming&#x2F;media&#x2F;comic convention and this is immediately obvious.<p>Most of the gaming&#x2F;media&#x2F;comic conventions I have been to have involved game&#x2F;media&#x2F;comic artists selling their own work, not people selling fan art.  In fact, the presence of the original artists selling copies of their original works is generally a big draw for the convention.  Maybe we go to different conventions or something (I have never been to an anime convention - so maybe that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re referring to).  The little third-party art I have seen at these conventions is sold with the explicit permission of the original artist&#x2F;IP holder.  So no, it is not &quot;obvious&quot; to me, as someone who has actually gone to a few gaming&#x2F;comic conventions before, that fan art is a huge industry or that it undercuts demand for the original art.<p>The fan art I have seen is generally drawn by (professional&#x2F;high-end amateur) artists for free on deviantart because they like the characters or want to practice their skills.<p>Also, nobody is currently suing (or particularly upset) over people making art on their home PCs.  People are suing over companies selling AI art generators for $billions that directly compete with the artists and stock photo libraries that were used to train these art generators.\n\n                &gt; Also, nobody is currently suing (or particularly upset) over people making art on their home PCs<p>Nobody is suing because few people have the resources to sue anyone, yes, but people are absolutely upset about all the AI art that is now on the internet.<p>Much of which is entirely non commercial, in the same way that any other piece of online fan art is.<p>But hey sure, if your position is that almost all of the online AI art stuff is totally fine (it&#x27;s mostly all non commercial), then great. You support almost all AI art.<p>So I guess that means that both fan art and AI art are basically the same anyway, using that same definition of non commercial, which was my entire point.<p>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if stable diffusion, or 1 or 2 other big companies go out of business at this point.<p>Their models are already available for anyone to use, and other people are training them even now.<p>A couple companies being sued doesn&#x27;t stop any of this technology even a little bit, because lots of amazing models are available.\n\n                  To be very clear: I support the prompters generating AI art under the same terms as fan art - you can do it for non-commercial purposes, but if you want to make money you have to get a license.  I do not support the companies selling AI art models for commercial purposes without compensating the people whose work they used to train.<p>The NYT&#x27;s lawyers and Getty&#x27;s agree with me, by the way - they aren&#x27;t suing users (and there are big users out there who could be worth suing).\n\n                    &gt;  I do not support the companies selling AI art models<p>Then you should be happy to know that the large majority of AI art models that matter are open source, or fine tuned open source models.<p>That&#x27;s most of the space.<p>You support basically all AI art, which is much different than what most artists are complaining about.<p>And even if a few of those big companies go away, those models are still out there and available for users to generate from.\n\n      There is also the fact they have driven themselves mad trying to &quot;detect&quot; or distinguish AI art, and now consistently attempt to tear each other down over claims of AI use.\n\n      Personally I think framing this as some kind of double-standard regarding copyright or even a copyright-specific issue misses the forest for the trees.<p>The problem I see is that the generative AI economy hinges on an injustice: the presumption that all art on the internet - no matter the medium, or means or relative notoriety of the artist - shall be candidate training data, and no burden of attribution whatsoever shall be laid upon those who leverage it.<p>Most graphic artists that I know bemoan copyright. But, it&#x27;s a tool that the law has given them.<p>Also: most graphic artists that I know exist under low economic circumstances - some near poverty - relative to most of the people I know who are building the next great wave of technological innovations with generative AI.<p>I don&#x27;t see a struggle over copyright. Artists, who exist towards the bottom of the economic ladder as it is, are doing what they can to survive.\n\n        &gt;no matter the medium, or means or relative notoriety of the artist - shall be candidate training data<p>Why is this a special case?  When people were viewing it, reposting it, using it to learn... those were all accepted uses.  Passing it off as your own wasn&#x27;t allowed, but outright plagiarism has pretty consistently been unaccepted.<p>The problem seems to stim from using it in a way that directly competes with the artist, and given your other point about their financial position, is a direct financial threat to them.  The morality of the situation seems to be that it is wrong because of the financial harm, but recognizing that such an argument is rarely accepted, it must instead be justified by some other argument, any other argument, that condemns the outcome.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is anything particularly unique.  How often do we find things wrong because of a logical argument as to why it is wrong, and how often do we find a logical argument to justify our felling that something is wrong?<p>There is also a element of helplessness.  No matter what the government does, pandora&#x27;s box has been opened and it can&#x27;t be closed.  While it might slow down the development of better AI, it isn&#x27;t going to stop it and banning existing software isn&#x27;t going to be possible.  The damage has been done, and even if the artists have an overwhelming victory, they are only going to recover a fraction of lost ground only to eventually lose it again.\n\n          The tricky part is that the ongoing training of ever-more-interesting generative AI *depends* on the ongoing labor of artists.<p>Proponents of the current economic model like to frame the artist rejection of AI as an obvious case of Luddism. Of course the artists reject this, it threatens their economic station! And: it&#x27;s not even wrong.<p>But, it is a high modernist foible: at some point the raw resource is fully exploited and the wave of companies that rode high on its vast-but-unrenewable quantity will reckon with reality. Their businesses are unsustainable (who could have foreseen it!).<p>In the mean time, artists won&#x27;t disappear. Most likely what will happen is that they will continue to subsist - they are essential in this economic loop, whether fairly compensated for their labor or not - but with an even lower economic posture than before.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a moral crisis here, but an economic one. Incidentally, an injustice is perpetrated upon an entire class of laborers. I&#x27;ll leave it to others to decide the morality of that, considering all the trade-offs.\n\n            Yeah one thing that&#x27;s often missed in these discussions is that the AI companies still need the artists! When you overexploit the commons, there will be consequences. We&#x27;ll see if the synthetic data is good enough or not for future models I guess.\n\n            &gt;ongoing training of even-more-interesting generative AI <i>depends</i> on the ongoing labor of artists. \nWhat does that mean? That you need artist to produce &quot;even-more-interesting&quot; art to train new iterations of generative AI? Could you point out some of these <i>superfresh</i> new art artist are doing that are completely different than things already done to exhaustion in the 1970s (other than anime)?<p>I don&#x27;t think you need artists for that anymore. Certainly you don&#x27;t need them for commercial purposes. If they are going to survive as an artist professionally, it will be because of the people that refuse to use AI art for whatever reason, but I don&#x27;t see how that won&#x27;t be short lived in the market.<p>Artists will survive, not professionally, but because they are doing it for the arts sake, even if that doesn&#x27;t offer them any financial reward.\n\n            &gt;The tricky part is that the ongoing training of ever-more-interesting generative AI <i>depends</i> on the ongoing labor of artists.<p>I think there is an ongoing issue.  Much like how the privatization of the public domain has led to an ongoing issue of a large percent of our culture being privately owned.  I&#x27;m not sure the fix to this.<p>I am by no means happy with the current situation, but I do find the moral reasoning behind the outrage at AI questionable at best as it doesn&#x27;t seem to be consistent and instead based on what is economically beneficial to those showing outrage.  By that same standard, AI is great because it lets me create things at a much cheaper cost.<p>Artist creating art of popular characters and AI using publicly posted art both seem pretty acceptable to me.  Then again I&#x27;m the weirdo who goes to conventions to buy originals, the ones actually painted on canvas and not just easily reproducible prints, even though that does mean paying far more than the prints cost.\n\n              We are booking our tickets to Comic-Con. We tap through the form, maneuvering past the cumbersome AI-generated takeover promoting a new prestige TV show. The AIs are getting pretty good, and seem to have moved beyond the glassy-eyed doll faces characteristic of the Stable Diffusion era. Nevertheless, the ads are obnoxious and we can&#x27;t wait to submit the form and get off of this website.<p>A memory rises unbidden: we once made comics and posted them to the web, free for all to read. We would even browse the web just to find and read them. Wild.<p>We find ourselves circuiting the convention hall. It is a brightly lit maze, festooned with endless AI-generated promotions for Marvel supers and yesteryear reboots. The cast of Friends is back, youthful as ever, and apparently we&#x27;re getting at least three more seasons. We round a corner and..<p>Here. Yes, here. We remember it now. This whole row was once filled with tables showcasing prints and original works of art. Behind the tables: a spouse, a friend, or the artist in the flesh. Artists, who were remarkable in their day for their contributions to the great pop culture that drew us to the convention. Artists who, despite their labor and their infamy among certain fandoms, never appeared in a legible place on the credit roll. Artists who worked a day job for years, stocking shelves, packing boxes, approving Disney licensee merchandise, so that in the evening they might bend their weary backs, put pen to tablet and spill their imaginations across the screen. Artists who did all that so that we could come to Comic-Con today and appropriate for ourselves an original work of their art.<p>Where once there were artists, now there is Hello Kitty. Sanrio has taken over the whole row. You can walk up to Hello Kitty and ask it for any combination of officially licensed characters, with optional accessories if you have a few more dollars to spend. A 3D printer somewhere behind the booth&#x27;s facade fabricates the bespoke toy on-demand in food-safe ABS. An original work of art.\n\n    Yes, blaming the victim, classic argument.\n\n  &gt; damage many feel they&#x27;ve done to the art community.<p>Boo hoo. This is not the first nor the last democratization of art. First people weren’t starving so many more could afford to become artists, printing presses could mass copy art, world wide shipping lanes moved styles, computer aids then photoshop, now AI. It’s always “been damaging to the art community”.<p>Now… to steelman the argument, it’s never been lower skill or easier to create your own modification or idea and get it in the style of some artist. In my opinion the low barrier to entry is obviously going to seem unfair - but - this is just going to make physical art more valuable.<p>If I were a sad-about-ai artist, I would jump in and see how new tools could improve my game.\n\n  &gt; damage many feel they&#x27;ve done to the art community<p>If the &quot;art community&quot; can&#x27;t understand what an insane gift SD1.5 and SDXL was to them then I don&#x27;t know what to tell them.<p>Without those open models we could have easily ended up in a world where this tech existed but was only in the hands of people who could pay OpenAI or Adobe a month to use it, and I mean with the power of it what should that cost be? I mean to have such an advantage the monthly cost could have easily been in the hundreds a month like high end CAD&#x2F;3D&#x2F;VFX software is and only viable for huge studios leaving normal people in the dirt.<p>Emad&#x27;s decisions mean for the rest of eternity a tool that could have ended up entirely locked behind an Adobe paywall can now be run on any machine you owned and tweaked entirely on your own hardware to work in a way specifically beneficial to your workflow.<p>I&#x27;m an artist and designer too, the fear of how fast these tools can replicate styles and take jobs becomes a lot less scary when I can take advantage of it myself or enhance my workflow with it myself without paying a subscription tax to do so. But if the &quot;art community&quot; can&#x27;t understand or imagine how bad this situation could have been then I don&#x27;t know what to tell them, some people just like being screwed over I guess...\n\n    My understanding is the art community has two problems:<p>1) Brand destruction: when SD was new, lots of people put &quot;Greg Rutkowski, trending on artstation&quot; in their prompts in order to get better images. It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that Greg Rutkowski being the single most popular example of this means he personally lucked out on this (some reporting suggests so), and the exposure really did boost his career. Do you think everyone else this has happened to was so lucky?<p>If I image search for &quot;Greg Rutkowski&quot;, I see some cool things yes, but I also see this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creator.nightcafe.studio&#x2F;creation&#x2F;gt4Z0uOIrrmop13OoUVc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creator.nightcafe.studio&#x2F;creation&#x2F;gt4Z0uOIrrmop13OoU...</a><p>I suspect that many others have suffered from this association.<p>2) Substitution: the exact opposite problem.<p>Now that the image generators are pretty good, why should anyone hire an artist?<p>This image was generated in 267 milliseconds, for free: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BenWheatley&#x2F;AI-art&#x2F;commit&#x2F;d4e0322a30ab50875f140fd0348ab37e9c949e50\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BenWheatley&#x2F;AI-art&#x2F;commit&#x2F;d4e0322a30ab508...</a><p>That image is not perfect, but it&#x27;s <i>good enough</i> for people like me, and that by itself is an economic risk to the future employability of that entire segment of the economy.<p>This really is important and does matter because all the talking heads were all busy confidently saying creative jobs like &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;writer&quot; were safe, and that it was truck drivers and factory workers who needed to re-skill, and thus we as a society have done basically nothing to prepare for or mitigate this economic disruption.<p>--<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s coming, not for me, not for anyone.<p>But I get why they feel scared, and I get why they feel this has taken something from them, even though the specific arguments about copyright and &quot;parroting&quot; that make it into public discussion (Gell-Mann amnesia warning) are often also deeply flawed and unconvincing.<p>To me, this is a trademark issue in the first case, not a copyright one; and in the second, the same disregard for workers that led to the creation of the actual literal Communist Manifesto.\n\n    &gt;I&#x27;m an artist and designer too, the fear of how fast these tools can replicate styles and take jobs becomes a lot less scary when I can take advantage of it myself or enhance my workflow with it myself without paying a subscription tax to do so.<p>Have you tried to train SD on your artwork? Pretty curious about the results an artist can achieve when embracing this tech.\n\n      Yeah I&#x27;ve fine-tuned it on our company product aesthetics and now our product team uses it for rendering and concept work, something that wouldn&#x27;t be possible using this tech via Midjourney, etc.\n\nThe open source community should pitch in.. goFundMe\n\n  If Stability was a nonprofit, sure. Otherwise, lol.\n\n    the models came out of an academic CS lab...can always fall back to those....\n\nEvery Forbes article should have the warning that they are not real publication anymore. Everything they publish is written with an intention that you believe an authors opinion as fact.<p>The model for Stability ends in a likely way, they will be swallowed up in a payday. We have recent examples of this.<p>For now, they’re the most open area in a garden of closing gates. And I wish them all the best.\n\n  Indeed.<p>Articles can be bought outright.\n\n  *Every legacy media article\n\n    No argument from me, but Forbes is special in this regard.<p>It takes $500 to be a “featured contributor” and they will post whatever nonsense you like. The brand is diluted.\n\n      See Wikipedias guidelines for sources.<p>(ctrl-f for forbes)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&#x2F;Perennial_sources#Sources\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&#x2F;Per...</a>\n\n  Yup, that’s why the HN code shows the username after the domain now, same as Twitter users.\n\n    I just noticed. Thanks for this friend. Much appreciated!\n\n  I was contacted by a Forbes writer for a hit piece, and his pitch on why he wanted to talk to me was clearly a lie.<p>They feel that they are entitled to be dishonest while writing articles about how CEOs are dishonest.\n\nArchived non paywall copy of the article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;iRIlp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;iRIlp</a>\n\n  Cheers to you, good citizen.  I wish more people started with such links rather than waiting for someone else to make it easy to have a discussion.\n\n    That&#x27;s a violation of HN guidelines.\n\n      Is it really?  TIL, thanks.<p>edit: Arguable.  I assume your referring to:<p>Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found on another site, submit the latter.<p>...and I might argue that an archive of the original is just as good, judging by the verbiage referring to &quot;If a post reports on...&quot;.  Archive links don&#x27;t change, remove, or add any context, they just make it accessible.<p>I suppose if we wanted to know this in specifics, it&#x27;d be a question for dang.\n\n      Posting paywalled links should be, as well.  It&#x27;s borderline marketing.  If I pay for the source, I don&#x27;t need to find it on HN.\n\n        not true. hn surfaces quality and adds discussion. and the people who wrote the content need acknowledgement&#x2F;attribution, and some conversion to paying, or they&#x27;ll eventually stop. do you think good reporting&#x2F;writing just falls from the sky?\n\n          It comes from imputing the facts into GPT 3.5 and asking it to write an article.\n\n      Sorry, what is? It isn’t to post or ask for archival links. It’s only a contravention if someone complains about paywalls.\n\n        When I try posting archived links, they are auto-dead.\n\n    It makes searching for repeated or similar articles difficult.<p>For example - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;iainmartin\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;iain...</a><p>Linking to archive (which incidentally gets into loops for me with the captcha) means that I can&#x27;t see the original article either (or use other methods to try to find reproductions).<p>Meanwhile, even though I hit the &quot;please get a subscription&quot; for Forbes, I can click the reader mode and read the page in its entirety.\n\nFor my use cases OpenAI&#x27;s DallE is often good enough. No more Discord nonsense.\n\n  You&#x27;re thinking of Midjourney. Stable Diffusion is awesome, you can run it locally on consumer GPUs.\n\n    Parent comment is classic HN: strongly held opinions with 100% confidence, 75% of the information.\n\n      Appropriately for the topic, also classic AI.\n\nThey should consider selling flounder\n\nSD3.0 looks really good and will probably displace a lot of closed image generation models once it&#x27;s out.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why Stability gets so little support from the community. They released the first usable open-source models and their models are the foundation of the most interesting AI-bashing workflows out there - VC funded or otherwise.\n\n  Yeah. It is weird. On one hand, v3 looks really good, the arch is sound, and the work is solid. On the other hand, selling Clipdrop is not a good sign (a growing startup divest is uncommon). Emad likes to talk about how they were able to retain researchers and now this, so it is hard to know what&#x27;s going on.\n\n    The CEO being a fraud could be a possible reason. Just saying.\n\n      You shouldn&#x27;t judge people by what Forbes says, but what people do. So far, Emad delivers on what he promises (with some delays here and there), and Stability.ai is the only one that publish image &#x2F; video generation models at production quality.\n\n        Not just Forbes. Read about him on Wikipedia.\n\n          &gt;However, according to him, he did not attend his graduation ceremony to receive his degrees, and therefore, he does not technically possess a BA or an MA.<p>Oh wow, he&#x27;s probably lying about his education.\n\n            I received them by mail. He didn&#x27;t?\n\n            actually he recently received his BA and MA now.\n\n            Good. I trust people who lie about their education and exceed the expected ability of a BA, vs. the huge amounts of barely articulate and completely disinterested CS graduates entering the workforce as of late\n\n        I mean, you get a nose for people like that after a while. They all have common characteristics like self aggrandizement, making bold claims and then changing tune when caught, a history of burnt out and salty ex co workers. It’s not that hard to spot in this guy’s case.\n\n      Certainly a shady player. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be in good hands.\n\n      Did you read the article?<p>I saw everyone repeating this over and over but then I actually read the article and couldn&#x27;t even understand what the big deal was... hard to find a founder who hasn&#x27;t done all the things he was accused off none of which were really a big deal.<p>Felt completely overblown and honestly like a weird hit piece but where the journo didn&#x27;t actually find any real dirt to smear.\n\n  Stability AI had <i>massive</i> support when Stable Diffusion 1.x and SDXL each hit the scene. But the Gen AI industry has evolved so rapidly that forks and iterations on the models outpaced them, especially commercially.<p>That&#x27;s a feature of open-source development, not a bug. But it&#x27;s a reason (along with the general financial issues which are the company&#x27;s fault alone) why Stability is switching to a &quot;need a membership to use commercially&quot; business model, and IMO it won&#x27;t work.\n\n    its a (minor, not permanent) blow to open source ai that stability, and now mistral, felt the need to switch to closed for their leading models. openwashing is a crowdpleaser but everyone goes closed when things get serious. basically only meta is the leading hope. i hope more players emerge - but i also dont have a ton of ideas on how to fund them. these efforts take serious resources.<p>that said i think its impt to acknowledge how much stability has shared in its research, just the other day they were on HN for Stable Video 3D, not to mention hourglass diffusion and other Stable* models. may not be the overwhelming SOTA but its real open source AI work that pushes the frontiers. you have to give them credit for that.\n\n      &gt; these efforts take serious resources<p>Meta just published their new optimization results [1]. According to them<p><pre><code>  &gt; training a 7B model on 512 GPUs to 2T tokens using this method would take just under two weeks.\n</code></pre>\nIn this context a GPU is an NVIDIA A100, which you can buy, if you can buy, for $10000.<p>And this is after an explosion of ideas that lead to unthinkable optimizations just two years ago.<p>If someone did train such a model 2 years ago, it would have cost hundreds of millions. Now it&#x27;s 5 million. Maybe in 2 years it&#x27;s going to be only $50k. Should you start a startup now and invest $5 million, an risk someone stealing the show for pennies in 2 years? If you do, I really can&#x27;t see if you can afford to open source the results of your training.<p>[1] training a 7B model on 512 GPUs to 2T tokens using this method would take just under two weeks.\n\n    There is nothing you can run on your computer that is even remotely as good as stability products.<p>Which means, there is nothing with even remotely the same fine tuning ecosystem.<p>And for that - stability is way ahead of the competition.\n\n  FWIW, they lost my interest entirely when they launched SD 2.0 and the model was worse,\npresumably (this was what people at the time were coming up with as the core problem) as they went overboard in their attempts at preventing it from generating naked photos (by removing so much from the training set that it no longer seemed to understand as well what a human looked like). The wider community then just got stuck on SD 1.5 and so frankly it isn&#x27;t clear to me if the work Stability was doing was even relevant anymore... even just a few weeks ago I saw some new thing using SD, said to myself &quot;god I hope it is using 1.5&quot;, and it was in fact (thankfully) still using 1.5.\n\n    SDXL is amazing.<p>The community is entrechend in 1.5 because that&#x27;s what everyone is now familiar with, IMO\n\n      Ok, I&#x27;ll try SDXL? But, I continue to believe that it was the botched release and attempts to push people with SD 2.x that led to whatever is being talked about in this thread for why Stability gets &quot;so little support from the community&quot;: I lost interest in what they were working on well before they released SDXL, as I was no longer convinced that their newer stuff would be better than their older stuff due to 2.x.<p>FWIW, &quot;everyone had gotten so used to 1.5 that they just didn&#x27;t want to bother with 2.x&quot; might provide a similar mechanism, if a very different place for the blame: if people aren&#x27;t paying attention to the new stuff you are building, it is going to hurt your &quot;support&quot;.\n\n      &gt;The community is entrechend in 1.5 because that&#x27;s what everyone is now familiar with, IMO<p>That probably has some weight to the community&#x27;s decision to still use 1.5.\nOther reasons (and more important IMO) why we&#x27;re still stuck on 1.5 is due to nerfing 2.0, and the plethora of user trained models based on 1.5.<p>I&#x27;m continued to be amazed by the quality possible with 1.5. While there are pros and cons of each of the different offerings provided by other image generators, I haven&#x27;t seen anything available to the public that can compete with the quality gens a competent SD prompter can produce yet.<p>SDXL seems to have taken off better than 2.0, but nothing so amazing to justify leaving all the 1.5 models behind.\n\n        Well, personally, SDXL just blows 1.5 out of the water for me. I haven&#x27;t had a reason to even touch 1.5 in months.<p>But note that SDXL is really awful in automatic1111 or vanilla HF diffusers for me. You have to use something with proper augmentations (like ComfyUI or Fooocus(which runs on ComfyUI)).\n\n          &gt;You have to use something with proper augmentations (like ComfyUI or Fooocus(which runs on ComfyUI))<p>Yeah, comfy was given a reference design of the sdxl model beforehand so it would be supported when sdxl was released. I should probably switch to comfy, but I don&#x27;t touch the tech very frequently as I don&#x27;t have a practical use case besides the coolness factor.\n\nThis many people leaving and key investors resigning from the board is definitely interesting. I wonder if there&#x27;s some undisclosed scandal that will break because this is pretty wild.\n\nOf course the verb they&#x27;re looking for is <i>founders</i>. A flounder is a fish. <i>Founder</i> (as a verb) means &quot;to fail.&quot;\n\n  No, Stability hasn&#x27;t foundered yet. They&#x27;re floundering: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;flounder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;flounder</a>\n\n  You have floundered in analyzing the headline\n\n  Per wiktionary (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;founder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;founder</a>)\nUsage Notes:\nFrequently confused with flounder. Both may be applied to the same situation, with the difference being the severity of the action: floundering (struggling to maintain position) comes first, followed by foundering (losing it by falling, sinking, or failing).<p>I think “flounder” is fine in this context.\n\n  Confidently incorrect is certainly the worst kind.\n\nI was looking for something about how the company actually made money, but only found this:<p>&gt; It’s a dramatic exodus that comes less than 18 months after Stability’s 2022 fundraise that valued the company at $1 billion. Now, the company is facing a cash crunch, with spending on wages and compute power far outstripping revenue, according to documents seen by Forbes. Bloomberg earlier reported that the company was spending $8 million a month. In November 2023, CEO Emad Mostaque tweeted that the company had generated $1.2 million in revenue in August, and would make $3 million in November. The tweet was later deleted.<p>This sounds a lot like the two-year period leading up to the dot com crash. Insane valuations and no revenue model. Meanwhile those insanely-valued companies bought Sun Microsystems servers like there was no tomorrow. When the games ended, a lot of those insanely-valued companies went to zero and left a massive overhang of Sun hardware in their wake. Sun began its long nosedive not long after that.\n\nHow can we help save Stability AI?"

      "conversation_text": "What the US needs is to fix its rail system. eminent domain the whole thing, pay off the robber barons and just run it like it matters to get shit from here to there.\n\n  <p><pre><code>  &gt;rail\n</code></pre>\nWrong niche. This is in the same market as conventional air freight.\n\n    Air freight is phenomenally inefficient compared to rail.\n\n      Most of the time but some remote locations it is not nor does it require rail volume.<p>Rail is less efficient than water transport most of the time but it does not always apply to the local situation.\n\n        Pareto principle means you should prioritize the 80%+ use case.  Most of the time is what you want to spend all your time&#x2F;money optimizing while making also the other use cases possible.\n\n          I think this is a terrible way to apply the Pareto principle.<p>80% of the time a hammer is a better tool than a screwdriver does not mean you should not use screwdrivers and just get better with a hammer.<p>Different tools for the job is more effective than one universal tool for everything\n\n      Rail is phenomenally inefficient crossing oceans compared to air freight\n\n        Hmm, if we ever built the Alaska-Siberia overland railway connection (bridges + tunnels) it would become a possibility to make efficient from what is now an impossibility.<p>It’s doable.  Tunnels and bridges necessary would not be beyond what we have built elsewhere with current technology.<p>The weather may be challenging in Winter though.\n\n          How is building a rail system for transporting freight to and from the U.S. that runs through Russian territory a good&#x2F;feasible idea?<p>Even if Russia agreed, Putin or whatever strong-man dictator they have next could suddenly decide it was a bad idea, and to block U.S. freight. Then we have no rail transport AND a grounded air fleet that would take time to get operational at the same output it is today.\n\n            I didn&#x27;t mean tomorrow (&quot;if we ever..&quot;), or the day after.  I meant one day when the US and Russia get along as well as China and the US do.  It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ll be at not-war war long into the future.  Building the bridges and tunnels would take probably a decade or two, the way we build things.  But if we did, then much of China&#x27;s trade that goes over airfreight could come over via rail... one day.\n\n            When goods stop crossing borders, soldiers start crossing borders. The easiest way NOT to go to war is to have open trade.\n\n              Best way to avoid war is to have the border be open ocean.<p>Having a railroad bridge with russia is inviting problems\n\n              That&#x27;s a nice little platitude but it&#x27;s not supported by the historical record.\n\n                Eh, the USA’s history seems to confirm it. I’m not really sure about others, but I’d be surprised if countries that are dependent upon one another were at war with one another.\n\n          Where is Mr Wilford when you need him?<p>Sorry couldn’t resist the Snowpiercer Reference - where they connect alaska to russia with a long ass bridge.<p>To be fair it does look like a “technically possible but ruinously expensive” kinda project.\n\n          If there was actually demand for faster high-volume shipping between East Asia and North America then logistics companies would just buy faster ships. The technology for that already exists and is far cheaper than building a railroad tunnel across the Bering Strait. Shipyards are capable of building freighters with more hydrodynamic hulls and powerful turbine engines. So far no one is really asking for those, which indicates the market doesn&#x27;t exist.\n\n            it exists in the form of air freight, which is stupidly more expensive, but also stupidly faster. so there is a market, just apparently not one in-between.\n\n          That’s several thousand miles of additional journey on your way to Shenzen or wherever? Massive amounts of track, tunnel and bridge that has to be maintained in extreme conditions and across multiple nations at odds with each other?<p>Or just put it on a boat?\n\n            I don&#x27;t think it would be as problematic as you suggest.  The Trans-Siberian railway already operates at similar distances.  Also China is building their belt-and-road network.  We could get goods from China, Japan, Korea and Russia all on this rail system.<p>The one sticky point might be gauge.  We&#x27;d want something all agree upon.  We&#x27;d want to avoid variable track gauge bogies.\n\n        Clearly, we need more airship transport.\n\n      Travel time of 8 hours vs 3 weeks... most things being transported by plane are ones where time is of the essence.\n\n        There’s such a huge time gap between our current rail and air that many things that are somewhat time sensitive end up flying which would use a reasonably quick rail network.  NYC to LA is well under 2,800 miles so getting just about anywhere in the continental US on rail in under 48 hours is a completely reasonable standard.<p>Yet, people moving from Texas to Florida don’t just park a U-Haul on a flatbed and fly, because it’s not just slow but also unpredictable. It can take weeks or even months in some cases because the network is optimized for coal and wheat etc which don’t care about delays just cost.\n\n          You think a completely reasonable standard is for a train to average 58 mph all the way across the united states without stopping?<p>What about all the slowdowns due to extremely rough terrain? The fact people have to be swapped out? The fact that not all cars are going all the way across the country and also have to be swapped out?<p>58mph average is insane.\n\n            Train’s don’t need to slow down for rough terrain because they can’t handle rough terrain and either route around it or tunnel through it. What they do need to slow down for is the rail network itself.<p>Poor track conditions, missing block signal systems,  and Trains without an automatic cab signal, automatic train stop or automatic train control system &quot;may not exceed 79 mph.&quot;<p>Freight trains really could travel a mostly Class 6 network at 120MPH in the US, we have regulations all the way to class 9.  They don’t because that’s not rail is optimized for.\n\n              So as you said it&#x27;s not actually reasonable to think a train is going to get across the US in 48 hours.<p>Trains have to slow down a lot when going through rough terrain because there are curves involved. You can&#x27;t go 80mph.\n\n    How much air freight really needs to be transferred by air, though?<p>Air freight makes sense when you need to get something across an ocean in less than a month, or across the continent in less than a day. If the US were to invest in running the railroads efficiently, getting a package from NYC to LA in less than 72 hours <i>should</i> be possible - that&#x27;s fast enough for regular Amazon shipping. If you electrify the railroads you could avoid an awful lot of CO2 emissions.<p>There are currently already container trains running from China to Europe (or at least there used to, before Russia started a war). It&#x27;s a viable midpoint between ocean freight and air freight.\n\n      &gt; <i>If the US were to invest in running the railroads efficiently, getting a package from NYC to LA in less than 72 hours should be possible</i><p>Still need air for every other pair of destinations. And in the meantime, I’d be shocked if that freight leg had enough volume to justify that expense over a couple more planes.\n\n      US freight rail companies have already invested heavily in efficiency and are now pretty much the most efficient in the world. What you seem to be asking for is a reduction in latency. You can&#x27;t have both high efficiency and low latency: those metrics are in direct conflict with each other.<p>Trucks with team driving can already run coast to coast in about 3 days. This works fine for somewhat time sensitive loads.\n\n      I think freight trains in Europe are much faster than in the US, but also much shorter (though there are plans to make them a little longer) and lighter (no double-stacked containers). So they are more costly but you get stuff from A to B faster.<p>Electrified locomotives are better than diesel electric (e.g. an electric locomotive has 2x - 3x the power, ~6MW-9MW compared to ~3MW, so you need less locomotives, less moving parts means less maintenance etc.), but while it works in dense Europe, it&#x27;s too costly to build and maintain cross US.\n\n        it&#x27;s probably too expensive for some of the country (mainly the great plains etc), but on the west coast and east of the Mississippi there&#x27;s definitely the density to support it.\n\n      72 hours is too long.  You need 48 hours or less for e-commerce or you’ll lose business to Amazon.  You could go multiple warehouses but that’s a huge expense with splitting inventory especially if you have lots of low volume skus.\n\n  When it comes to freight rail, the US is in the top handful of countries in the world by pretty much any metric.<p>We’re not great at passenger rail, but we beat all of Europe when it comes to the amount of freight shipped via rail per capita, and all of Europe except Switzerland based on the percentage of total freight transported by rail.\n\n    This is a myth oft-repeated on HN. US freight rail does cheaply transport a lot of tonnage, but it is a shadow of its former self, after a half-century of digesting the investments of the past. It&#x27;s squeezed out efficiency by running longer and slower trains (that exceed the length of the rail sidings!) transporting bulk goods on predictable schedules between fixed points (like grain and coal), while slashing routes and reducing maintenance. It ships <i>a lot</i> of freight, but it does not do so effectively, quickly, nor safely, or flexibly.\n\n      &gt; <i>myth oft-repeated on HN. US freight rail does cheaply transport a lot of tonnage, but it is a shadow of its former self</i><p>What is the myth? It is a shadow of its former self.

None of those stats are incorrect.<p>“ It ships a lot of freight, but it does not do so effectively, quickly, nor safely, or flexibly.”<p>What does effectively even mean? If it weren’t effective people wouldn’t use it to ship.\n\n    This is true, and I&#x27;ve made the point myself previously on HN.<p>But US freight <i>tonnage</i> is dominated by cheap bulk goods, most notoriously coal, though grain and bulk liquids (petroleum, industrial).[0]<p>There&#x27;s <i>also</i> a lot of intermodal &#x2F; containerised freight, but this is almost exclusively long-haul &quot;land bridge&quot; traffic, with very little trade or viability for short-haul freight (&lt; 500 mi) or less-than-truckload (LTL) carriage.[1]<p>Cross-country carriage <i>still</i> takes 10--14 days, despite the fact that a through-routed train travelling at 79 MPH (peak speed on most freight lines) could in theory make the distance in about a day and a half.  For time-sensitive goods, including much fresh produce, this means that truck or air freight is the only viable option.<p>I&#x27;ve gone digging for any recently published research on new innovations in traditional freight technologies and ... there simply isn&#x27;t any to speak of.[2]  Much of the underlying infrastructure is literally a century or more old.  The last major powerplant revolution was the introduction of the diesel-electric locomotive which will have its centennial next year.[3]<p>Given the present obsession with electrified lorry projects, it seems to me to make far more sense to look at optimising rail-based delivery to provide for far more flexible routing, dynamic trainset assembly and disassembly, higher-speed fright,[4] integration of light freight (e.g., document and high-value product delivery) with high-speed rail systems,[5] or rail-trolly systems, in which local delivery occurs via either autonomous or small-trainset convoys which decouple from a through system and reach endpoints or local distribution centres at lower speeds on local rail or dedicated roadbed routes.

I assumed the discussion was about better utilizing the infrastructure we already have for rail.\n\n  We&#x27;re like a couple years away from having the tech to just give all autonomous electric vehicles the leftmost lane on the interstates from 10pm-6am, then raise the speed limit to 90 or 100 mph. Let trucking companies drive these vehicles a few feet apart from each other for aerodynamics. If you could book a sleeper taxi in New York and be in Chicago in the morning, or San Francisco to Seattle, for cheaper than a flight, without destroying the environment, would you do it?\n\n    This is roughly equivalent to flying if the car is ICE\n\n      And if the car is not ICE then you still have the problem of tire particle pollution. Trains are better.\n\n    I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;ve talked to about this, but just because it&#x27;s electric and robo-driven doesn&#x27;t mean they get to skip aerodynamic drag. Air resistance increases at the square of velocity. 4 miles&#x2F;kWh at 55 becomes &lt; 2 mi&#x2F;kWh at 85. 100 mph and you&#x27;re measuring in kWh&#x2F;mile.\n\n      If you double the speed, the air resistance gets quadrupled. Power output needed for constant speed travel is octupled (P=Fv). Now you need a higher-power motor and more expensive batteries that can sustain this kind of power output. The typical electric vehicle available today can&#x27;t sustain a speed of 100 mph without thermal throttling kicking in.<p>Sure making the electric motor more powerful isn&#x27;t that big of a problem: just look at electric trains. But making the batteries more powerful will require significant more research.\n\n    That sounds lovely. Of course, you&#x27;ll never achieve that with automobiles, so we&#x27;ll be needing the trains to make it possible. No tires and significantly less chances of a collision that will kill you.\n\n  Just add a few more gliders and it&#x27;ll be a sky train.\n\n    If you go to their website you&#x27;ll see several members of their senior leadership have railroad experience.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aerolane.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aerolane.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;</a>\n\n  I often advocate this position! The Union Pacific is surprisingly affordable and after you gain a controlling interest it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;ve just torched $80 billion, because you bought a valuable asset.<p>For the state of California to do a hostile takeover of the UPRR, spin off an operating company for the train part, and retain the rights of way while adjusting the attitudes of the executives, would save a large amount of money just by simplifying the High Speed Rail project. It would be well worth it and we can afford it.\n\n  “Just 1 simple fix”<p>Hopefully they bulldoze your neighborhood first. Mine? I know my neighbors would wage war…\n\n    Who said anything about bulldozing neighborhoods? Why would you wish that on someone else?\n\n      That&#x27;s what eminent domain is.\n\n        Oh so the railway infrastructure isnt able to be differentiated from peoples homes around it?\n\n          You wouldn’t need eminent domain in that case\n\n            &gt;Eminent domain (United States, Philippines), land acquisition (India, Malaysia,[1][2] Singapore), compulsory purchase (Ireland, United Kingdom), resumption (Hong Kong, Uganda), resumption&#x2F;compulsory acquisition (Australia, Barbados, New Zealand, Ireland), or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) is the power of a state, provincial, or national government to take private property for public use.\n\nIt sounds interesting…<p>But it’s one thing to try and win an existential war by any means necessary including downgrading safety, but I think it’s another thing when you intend to use this for civilian freight transportation.<p>What’s the contingency for a snapped tow rope? Or electro&#x2F;hydromechanical failure on either aircraft during take off or landing?  One plane involved is plenty to handle; how do you handle two?<p>Light glider planes with one passenger or two is one thing, but an unpiloted freight aircraft, I’d think has greater risk.  I get they might have remote operators for the glider, but some situations need proximate feedback.\n\n  &gt; <i>What’s the contingency for a snapped tow rope?</i><p>Same as with a dead engine: fuck off to the nearest airstrip or improvise an air strip.\n\nIANAAE (...not an aerospace engineer), but I smell a metric boatload of utterly delusional thinking here.<p>&gt; ...remarkably simple way to slash air cargo costs as much as 65% – by having planes tow autonomous, cargo-carrying gliders behind them, big enough to double, or potentially triple their payload capacity.<p>A 65% cost reduction via tripling the payload would require that <i>costs</i> not increase, no?  Are these huge cargo gliders <i>free</i> to purchase&#x2F;operate&#x2F;maintain?  And hauling them around puts zero additional load on the engines of the air freighter that&#x27;s towing them, to increase maintenance or fuel costs?<p>&gt; ...payload-carrying gliders were towed toward combat zones in World War 2, full of troops and&#x2F;or equipment, then released to attempt unpowered landings in the thick of things – with widely variable results, particularly where stone-walled farms were a factor.<p>True, but glider losses due to mishaps (starting with broken tow ropes) were damned high even before they got to the target area.  What % of cargo being lost in transit do these folks figure is acceptable, in the modern air freight business?<p>&gt; These &quot;Aerocarts&quot; will be pulled down the runway by the lead plane just like a recreational glider. They&#x27;ll lift off more or less together...<p>Ask anyone with a pilot&#x27;s license about this.  Especially if he has experience with taxiways at large &amp; busy airports, or with taking off in anything less than picture-perfect weather, or with airplanes that lack &quot;sporty&quot; thrust&#x2F;weight ratios.<p>&gt; With no propulsion systems, you save all the weight of engines, motors, fuel, ...<p>Even if your towing airplane magically does not need larger engines or more fuel to haul 2x or 3x the weight around - what happens when you land, and the tow plane engages its thrust reversers?\n\n  I am barely smarter than a five year old and also think this is a disaster of an idea.\n\n  &gt; <i>A 65% cost reduction via tripling the payload would require that costs not increase, no?</i><p>I think it&#x27;s a cost reduction vs. shipping that 2x (or 3x) cargo using 2 (or 3) conventional planes, not somehow making it cheaper than a single plane with its normal amount of cargo (or a magic plane with 2x the capacity).<p>&gt; <i>Are these huge cargo gliders free to purchase&#x2F;operate&#x2F;maintain?</i><p>No, but they&#x27;re presumably cheaper in those metrics than running a conventional plane.  If it costs $50k to run a single conventional plane, but you can tack on one of these towed gliders and it only costs $15k more, that&#x27;s cheaper than running 2 conventional planes at $100k.<p>&gt; <i>And hauling them around puts zero additional load on the engines of the air freighter that&#x27;s towing them, to increase maintenance or fuel costs?</i><p>Certainly this will add a cost, but if the towed glider has essentially zero fuel cost, presumably you still come out ahead.  And presumably the glider will have lower maintenance costs, since it lacks engines and presumably other stuff a powered, crewed conventional cargo plane would need.<p>Totally agree with you on the skepticism around safety and reliability, though.\n\n  Rube Goldberg is looking down kindly upon this scheme.\n\nThe cargo a plane can carry isn&#x27;t limited only by the volume of the interior, but also by the amount of weight that can be carried safely in the plane. Airlines try to balance the amount of dense and non-dense (a.k.a. volumetric) cargo to solve for the joint constraint by charging different prices for cargo depending on the greater of its weight cost vs. its volume cost.<p>Even if it turned out to be practical to double the volume of cargo you could carry, it seems unlikely that it would allow you to double the weight of the cargo, since the engines and the airframe have all been designed around the same set of engineering requirements. The best case scenario would be a decrease in the cost of volumetric cargo, with dense cargo staying the same.\n\n  The article is about having a completely separate plane (glider, really) that is towed by a conventional plane.  The glider gets to ride in the powered plane&#x27;s wake, and presumably the fuel cost to tow the cargo plane is less than the cost of flying two independent planes.<p>This isn&#x27;t about making a larger conventional plane that has more volume to put cargo in.\n\n    Right, but if a plane has a maximum takeoff weight of 600k lb, I doubt if it can safely takeoff while being 600k lb AND towing another x00k lb in a glider, which is what would be required to reduce cargo costs by 65%.\n\nIf you&#x27;re happy for your gliders to travel at 100 mph instead of 500 mph, you can glide almost fuel free, making use of thermals and winds most of the way.<p>However, the finances for such a business are hard to make work since, while you save on fuel, your very expensive aircraft does fewer flights per year.<p>The only way to make it work would be very cheap airframes, probably without humans aboard (meaning factors of safety and maintenance costs can be dropped).<p>But developing new airframes is awfully hard.\n\n  Only sport gliders carrying a maximum of 2 people achieve those speeds fuel free. A large, heavy cargo glider carrying a full load is just going to crash without a tow rope, regardless of winds or thermals.\n\n    You probably wouldn&#x27;t go totally fuel free - you&#x27;d go mostly fuel free.<p>And yes, the craft would have to be absolutely huge for a decent  payload - and it might make sense to use different construction techniques considering that - for example an inflatable fully pressurised craft.\n\n      Could probably add relatively inexpensive drone systems to the gliders with some solar and a battery to enable it to assist in landing and taxiing, as well as dealing with weather and the inevitable crashes.<p>I am aware that flying is the safest form of mass transportation but crashes do still happen and should be accounted for, after all, and it would be nice if the autonomous glider drone systems had a touch of brains in it to try to not land on a house or into a highway or something.\n\nReminds me of the Me 321 [0]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Messerschmitt_Me_321_Gigant\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Messerschmitt_Me_321_Gigant</a>\n\nAnd artillery if you make the glider from gun cotton.\n\nCouldn&#x27;t you also just get fuel saving benefits from multiple aircraft flying in formation? <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;api&#x2F;citations&#x2F;20205006743&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;AIAA20124802.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;api&#x2F;citations&#x2F;20205006743&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;AI...</a><p>I&#x27;m surprised that companies like fedex don&#x27;t do this."

      "conversation_text": "People&#x27;s aversion to change, even when the change is for something that is objectively better in every way, is really really annoying.\n\n  Obviously people are the problem. That&#x27;s why cities which are people free are the best cities.\n\n  It&#x27;s a lot of work and money to convert a NA city to a car free one. It&#x27;s probably impossible TBH.<p>My city has the best public transit system in NA but still I can&#x27;t imagine it be car free. It&#x27;s going to literally kill people.\n\n    I don&#x27;t know where this sentiment comes from, you think NA cities didn&#x27;t exist before the Ford Model-T? Many of these cities existed and worked even without everyone having a private horse&#x2F;carriage they just had trolleys.\n\n      I&#x27;m fine if you want to go back to the 19th century. I don&#x27;t.\n\n      &gt;&gt; you think NA cities didn&#x27;t exist before the Ford Model-T?<p>They existed but they were incredibly shitty, literally.\n\n  People mock the soviet way of building neighborhoods but it was miles better.<p>Instead of extensive pointless suburbs where everybody has his house, they built huge 8&#x2F;10 story buildings.<p>The buildings were surrounded by parks, benches, places for kids to play.<p>People aggregated a lot and everything was relatively close (building taller means you can build a lot closer to downtown).<p>I have lived 6 months in Ohio, Columbus, and I can&#x27;t but say you live much worse. One thing I noticed is that lack of good public transport is one of the major causes for neighborhoods to become ghettos and poor. You&#x27;re a guy that lives some 15&#x2F;20 miles off Columbus and there&#x27;s a job in the city? Well, if you&#x27;re <i>that poor</i> that you don&#x27;t have a car you can&#x27;t work there either. And nowadays you need at least 2&#x2F;3k year for insurance alone. This lack of public transport is one of the major reasons why so many areas around big cities become slowly poor and ruined and people have tougher chances to start making a living.<p>In 2024 with everybody owning a car Polish neighborhoods have transformed. Cars fill every single space. Kids are constrained to small often remote areas. Benches get removed to get more parking spaces. People don&#x27;t aggregate anymore, there&#x27;s a much smaller sense of a community.<p>In many ways, the progress I have seen in Poland made the country just unhappier and lonelier. I would even bluntly say that my parents and my parents parents had it much better. They would party and dance every week, always on some trip or vacation.<p>Sure, the party would have people bringing their own glasses, salami and something to drink, but people really enjoyed the times.<p>Cars are just one of the major factors that transformed our cities for worse.\n\n    Why did people buy cars if they didn&#x27;t need them?\n\n      Status symbol, larger shopping (cargo bikes weren&#x27;t ever a thing due to lack of bike paths), vacation, business.\n\n        Everything other than status symbol seems legitimate\n\n          All reasons are legitimate. But with proper action all can be addressed and diminished. They weren&#x27;t in Poland. So now we are drowning in traffic and parking issues just like everybody else despite superior dwelling style.<p>You asked why Polish people bought cars if they didn&#x27;t need them.<p>The answer is that they started needing them. Large shopping malls popped up on the outskirts of cities not easily accessible without a car.<p>Trains and other mass transit didn&#x27;t really improve to meet the demand for travel from richer populace. Often it deteriorated. People were forced to substitute public offering that didn&#x27;t keep up with private car ownership. Public enterprises are hard and when the government fails people invest in personal facilities to get by.<p>People buing cars is a sign of the community dropping the ball on the mobility needs of the people.\n\n    This sounds very like some of the high-rise estates built in the UK in the past.<p>The experience here was... not good.<p>I think what Barcelona has done is a much better model.\n\n    That idea was a fork of the &quot;seperated&quot; areas for everything idea - and it failed spectacularly. No shops in the blocks, no thirds places. Commie blocks have done the idea of a liveable city a disservice.\n\n    As a fellow (ex-)soviet from up north...<p>Soviet way of building sucked. You guys had it a tad easier, but in USSR-proper the standardisation sucked big time. It&#x27;s damn fantastic now that building a custom private house in a legal way is doable, even without being a party elite. And soviet style of building wouldn&#x27;t have happened without totalitarian control.<p>People aggregating and community is ripped away by interwebs. Although in USSR-proper it was iffy in any case. Yes, people spent a tad more time outside. But community building was very superficial and it was easy to get in trouble with KGB.<p>Some parts of society did enjoy the times. Other parts just enjoyed drinking their days away. And for many it was quite shitty.<p>Nowadays there&#x27;re many more opportunities to enjoy the times. And I&#x27;m not talking about spending €€€ for fancy stuff. But the problem is there&#x27;re too many modern distractions. Which would have been a thing wether soviet union survived or not. Just like soviets couldn&#x27;t solve alcoholism which was the distraction #1 at the time.\n\n      &gt; And soviet style of building wouldn&#x27;t have happened without totalitarian control.<p>Todays new developments are done in roughly the soviet style. Blocks of flats. With minor adjustments like parking (also underground), lifts that go to ground level for accesibility and border fences to increase the sense of security, top level huge flats with huge terraces for the rich, thicker walls for acustic and thermal comfort.<p>I think at least 90% of newly created housing in post-commie city in central Europe is built this way. It just makes sense.\n\n        It&#x27;s nowhere near soviet era planning. Soviet era planning was factory-made identical blocks of blocks of flats. Typically with apartment blocks surrounding kindergarten, school and a supermarket with a cafeteria. 3 minutes city if you will.<p>Which works nicely if people have no choice and no needs beyond what is available in the block. And as long as whole city is just a repetition of identical blocks with identical facilities - it sorta does work.<p>Modern development here throws away all of that. Custom buildings with highly customised apartments. Multiple identical buildings is rare, let alone identical copy-pasta neighbourhoods. From high-raises to low-raises to townhouses to detached houses.<p>On top of that, many soviet planning ideas were based on idea that you work in same place your whole life and possibly get an apartment close to your workplace. That assumption does not work anymore (for better or worse). And let&#x27;s not talk about running small businesses targeting niche demographics.\n\n    &gt; they built huge 8&#x2F;10 story buildings.  The buildings were surrounded by parks, benches, places for kids to play.<p>This is exactly what they did for &quot;the projects&quot; in big American cities and these were almost universally viewed as failures.\n\n      Projects in US instead catered to house the poorest part of society thus they became fertile ground to breed criminality and further ghetto-ization. Giving people houses in areas where there&#x27;s no real jobs or connection downtown makes things even worse.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that a country with a better public transport, such as the UK, made its projects a largely successful experiment. In Eastern Europe this kind of housing too was aimed at the masses, not the poor.<p>I would not say that the issue was the city planning per se. The US is filled by poor neighborhoods&#x2F;open space ghettos too.\n\n    I grew up in a similar bloc of flats in România, it was fine. It has indeed only gotten worse as the number of cars grew.\n\n  It seems to me that your &quot;objectively better in every way&quot; is subjective.<p>If it were objectively better in every way, I&#x27;d give my car up obviously.\nBut there&#x27;s the _small_ matter of major inconvenience with places inaccessible by public transport, erratic public transport, bad last-mile solutions with private transportation waiting to fleece us for all we&#x27;re worth, leaving me questioning my life choices when the last mile costs 10x what 90% of the journey cost me in public transport, not to mention the overall experience of having to switch between multiple modes of transport each way.<p>Climate change...yes, but I&#x27;m not altruistic enough to go through this everyday.\n\n    &gt; But there&#x27;s the _small_ matter of major inconvenience with places inaccessible by public transport, erratic public transport, bad last-mile solutions with private transportation waiting to fleece us for all we&#x27;re worth,<p>Where do you live? I see places becoming inaccessible by car due to missing parking places and traffic jams and just love to take a bike &#x2F; scooter &#x2F; public transport (which could be much better even if we&#x27;d put more focus there, and would also help the poorer people) or by feet. The very few occasions I need a car could be handled by car sharing or delivery services.. I regret having bought one (:\n\n      I think it depends on, as you suggested, the location one lives. I think it is safe to say that if one has a family and live in the North America, there are few places, if there is any, that you can live a comfortable life without cars.<p>I live in a city with advanced public transit system (of course, comparing to other NA apparently, not other continents). Theoretically, I can go around without much driving. But there are always moments that driving a car helps a lot. One example is going to Costco. A second example is to lay one&#x27;s feet 50+ kms away from home. A third one is to go to a clinic whenever I would like.<p>Cars enable flexibility. I think it&#x27;s pretty hard to convince people to drop it, UNLESS the culture completely changes. Culture change would bring economical and political changes as well -- but that&#x27;s a multi-decade process. This is why, may I say, that a car free policy is practically impossible for most, if not every NA city.\n\n  People&#x27;s tendency to describe a change they like as &quot;objectively better&quot; for <i>everyone</i> is really really annoying.\n\n  &gt;&gt; People&#x27;s aversion to change...<p>When cars first became affordable in the US in the 1910&#x27;s, due to mass production and financing, they were very quickly adopted in massive numbers. So I don&#x27;t think it is fair to say that people have an aversion to change.<p>Are you sure the annoyance isn&#x27;t that they just don&#x27;t want the changes you want them to want?\n\n  &quot;Objectively better&quot; according to my personal subjective values and beliefs.<p>&quot;Aversion to change&quot; that I would like to force onto others.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;2024.03.20-044756&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;car-free-cities-opposition&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;2024.03.20-044756&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;s...</a>\n\nI know I hate driving in Pro-Car Cities.\n\n  And that&#x27;s the irony of cars. The more people love to drive, the less lovely the drive becomes.\n\nI was back in Taiwan last year after an extended absence.<p>It&#x27;s pretty amazing how easy it is to get around with a combination of the mass rapid transit (MRT) system and high speed rail (HSR).<p>When I was last there, you still needed to take a bus or taxi from TPE to the city center.  Now right from TPE airport, you can be in either Taipei city center in 30 minutes (MRT) or on the other end of the island in short order (HSR).  Which is kind of fun because the southern end of the island has a totally different vibe.<p>Within Taipei, you can get to where you need to using the MRT and walk (fun because there&#x27;s so many interesting nooks and back alleys anyways) or use bike rentals.  There&#x27;s also abundant buses as well connecting from the MRT stations.<p>Taichung has a single MRT line that connects east to west right off of the HSR line.<p>Kaohsiung has a few MRT lines and surface light rail that connect the major attractions.<p>All of it quite cheap to get around, incredibly clean and well maintained, and just all around made it much more enjoyable wandering the city.<p>The only time we felt the need for a car was visiting the more remote north&#x2F;east coasts and only because we wanted to save time versus waiting for the slower trains that run those routes.<p>Whenever I land in SFO, I wonder who&#x27;s bright idea it was to not have an easy connector to CalTrain at Milbrae (or I&#x27;m doing something wrong -- I feel like I don&#x27;t fully understand the right way to get to Milbrae from SFO).  Then on weekends, there&#x27;s barely any service so if you land on a Sunday for a business trip, you&#x27;ll waste so much time waiting for the train.<p>Indeed, it is jarring when we returned to the US.\n\n  The way Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea fund trains is a big difference with the US (though ironically is similar to how the US used to fund trains in the 1800s). The companies (usually in some kind of private-public partnership from my understanding) who build and run the trains in East Asia typically get land around the train stop to develop into malls, shops, apartments, etc. These sales and rents then fund the train lines. This incentive to keep everything nice on the trains and around the stops to help the other sides funding is important I think.\n\n    This is sort of the model that Brightline (Fortress Investment) is using. They are spending money on the train service in hopes of increasing the values of their real estate investments.\n\n      Its a smart investment strategy. If you can offer someone a walkable little neighborhood where they can live, walk to a a gym, grocery store, and a couple bars or restaurants, AND also walk to a train that can take them to work and a few more areas. That is an attractive offer. Even if the person still has a car, people seem to enjoy not driving everywhere.\n\n        Yes. I actually think this should apply to publicly run systems as well.<p>It seems like in the US we often lament that government run systems run at a loss instead of a profit, but also tend to hamstring them from doing things (like building shopping, dining, offices, housing on top of transit stations) that a private enterprise would do to make its investment profitable.\n\n    A strange thing about South Korea is that even the most expensive condos in Gangnam derive a significant part of their value from being close to a subway station (<i>yeoksekwon</i>). The millionaires who live there are riding the subway right beside the pleebs! No wonder they want to keep the trains nice and clean.\n\n      It&#x27;s the same in Taipei.\n\n      This is incorrect.<p>Yes, people appreciate the subways but not in the way you just described. It&#x27;s the &quot;wealthy&quot; that use the subway as well as a car, but the expensive condos in Gangnam are not using or caring about the subway. The subway is just a plus.<p>People living in the expensive parts of Gangnam(-gu) are not riding the subway. People living in the affordable parts of Gangnam(-gu) are.<p>In fact, if you look on a map in Gangnam, you will find the apartments at the doorsteps to subway stations are huge complexes for generic wealthy people. But the expensive apartments are as far as possible between the subway stops, but still in walking distance:<p>- 서초그랑자이<p>- 래미안 리더스원<p>- 서초푸르지오써밋<p>- 신반포 area services insanely expensive apt blocks but is just 1 lame station.\n\n        One can always find counterexamples in a large city.<p>Meanwhile, the one lame station you mentioned that serves the 신반포 area is directly connected to the financial district and the airport. And just a couple of blocks away is 고속터미널 station where three subway lines intersect.\n\n          Well yeah.. all subway stations connect in Korea and are very useful?<p>The rich in expensive apartments don&#x27;t use them. In fact in order to appear rich, people prefer to take taxis and their car. That&#x27;s why the entire city is filled with cars even when they&#x27;re incredibly slow.\n\n  I had the same experience when I first moved out to the Bay Area. You&#x27;d think with all the marketing that they would have solved something as simple as mass transit, maybe Jetson&#x27;s style with personal pneumatic tubes.<p>Nope, there&#x27;s barely any transit. Maybe it&#x27;s okay if you live near a BART station. The best my employer could do was offer a shuttle that also had to sit in traffic for at least 45 minutes each way. I bike to work now and it takes 15 minutes here in Amsterdam.\n\n  I&#x27;ve lived in a number of cities across three continents and I tend to think that the idea of a &quot;car-free&quot; city is a quintessentially North American overreaction to a quintessentially North American problem.<p>Like yes Wired we know that the suburb and the American commute have some serious downsides and the US leaned way too much into this model during a period of high population growth.<p>However it&#x27;s not like other approaches to urban planning have no downsides. I personally like the Asian model of high density and mixed use zoning but here are some realities that come with it: noise, more pollution, more construction, less space, commercial usage pushing up land values etc.<p>There is no one size fits all so I tend to think most US cities would benefit from just dialing back the size of some of the suburban wastelands out there, keeping density low to medium and re-zoning to allow certain less intrusive types of businesses. One compact urban core, a low to medium density mixed use ring and a suburban fringe perhaps. Yes people are still going to need to cars in this city but a lot of commutes, shopping trips etc. are likely to get shorter.<p>For somewhere like San Francisco there&#x27;s probably a great argument for the type of development you see in Taipei or Tokyo where you lean heavily into commuter rail and the train stations become big multi-use complexes and the center(s) of your city. But this is a huge reorganization of people&#x27;s lives and existing property development that there&#x27;s going to be a lot of pushback against and it&#x27;s not all going to be nimbyism.\n\n    <p><pre><code>    &gt; But this is a huge reorganization of people&#x27;s lives and existing property development that there&#x27;s going to be a lot of pushback against and it&#x27;s not all going to be nimbyism\n</code></pre>\nIf anything, I feel like Taiwan&#x27;s model should prove that you can do it <i>anywhere</i> precisely because it was already so dense and built up on top of being in an area with very high seismic activity.  It&#x27;s not like they could find a lot of room to build massive stations on the surface.  You barely notice the underground MRT stations at all aside from stair arches that pop out of the ground[0].  If they can make it work in a city as dense and populated as Taipei, it feels like it ought to be possible anywhere.<p>And on the contrary, being close to an MRT line tends to drive up the price of housing in the area given it seems a strong selling point for the folks that live and work in the city.  I think the real root cause is that US society is not egalitarian enough to make this work.<p>[0] Examples: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;JS8WEKhKmiVMGWCF6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;JS8WEKhKmiVMGWCF6</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;mXFjKiAQ8Vf47SAG8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;mXFjKiAQ8Vf47SAG8</a>\n\n      I can&#x27;t speak to the history of Taipei specifically, I did visit for a month (loved it) and I currently live in the center of a different Asian megalopolis.<p>I can say a lot of these places became what they are by bulldozing a lot of medium-density shophouses and destroying a lot of local businesses and tightly knit communities that most people including myself would consider really charming places to live.<p>They replaced them with places where far fewer people can afford a space large enough to raise kids comfortably and where everyone around you is a stranger.<p>Now I enjoy the big dense city lifestyle, I like the awesome public transit, I like the massive selection of businesses and services and basically everything, but it&#x27;s not for everyone and I couldn&#x27;t see myself raising a family in the middle of it, which eventually if you want your country&#x27;s population to not collapse, you need people to do somewhere.<p>I think also considering some of the massive redevelopments that have happened in Asia over the years, you would see massive pushback in the US from essentially an individual rights point of view if you were to try to do that.\n\n        It feels like it needs to have the right mix of transit to make it work.<p>Wife and I both agreed that we preferred Kaohsiung to Taipei if we were to live in Taiwan.  With the HSR, it would be about the equivalent of my commute from Princeton to NYC.\n\n      But that&#x27;s precisely the problem, isn&#x27;t it? It doesn&#x27;t pay to build a subway when you don&#x27;t have enough density. Most other forms of transit also get stuck in traffic.\n\n    It&#x27;s tricky too, because a lot of &quot;low density suburban wastelands&quot; was already significantly phased out over a decade ago, in a lot of the US anyway.<p>People hear &quot;suburbs&quot; and imagine a single-family home on 1 to 2+ acre lots -- something that looks like this -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;st2.depositphotos.com&#x2F;1658611&#x2F;5485&#x2F;i&#x2F;950&#x2F;depositphotos_54852017-stock-photo-large-suburban-house.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;st2.depositphotos.com&#x2F;1658611&#x2F;5485&#x2F;i&#x2F;950&#x2F;depositphot...</a> . And while that definitely still happens, it&#x27;s really limited to the exurbs in the US these days, it&#x27;s not representative of newer suburbs anymore.<p>The primary style of suburban development built since say 2010 in the US, has really been more like 5 single-family homes on 1 acre, or 10 townhouses on 1 acre, or equivalent. Something that looks like this -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thumbs.dreamstime.com&#x2F;z&#x2F;modern-suburbs-17207940.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thumbs.dreamstime.com&#x2F;z&#x2F;modern-suburbs-17207940.jpg</a> or this -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.seattletimes.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;02152023_3-townhomes-kevin_165753.jpg?d=2040x1323\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.seattletimes.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;0...</a> -- which is anywhere from 5x to 20x higher density per acre.\n\n      This is true, but that model of suburban development still tends to push necessities out of walking or even biking distance. I visited my folks in the Des Moines suburbs while they were out there and it was an hour&#x27;s walk to almost anything bigger than a corner store. Of which I found, I think, one that was closer than that.\n\n        If we go by your parent&#x27;s photos, my main beef with these neighborhoods is there&#x27;s no commercial development. There should be (light) commercial development.<p>I am a big fan of the Asian shophouse. You can open a restaurant or a convenience store or a small clinic or whatever class of local service business isn&#x27;t going to be too disruptive on the bottom floor of your residential property. You need to own and operate it, it can&#x27;t be someone from outside the community. People eat, shop and live together and spend more locally. Small businesses get easier to create. Everyone has neighbors again. People walk two blocks down instead of driving 30 minutes to Walmart. Yes I&#x27;m stacking multiple social agendas here.<p>You probably do have to go towards medium density for this to be viable but maybe if you don&#x27;t you still end up with people taking a lot of 10 minute car rides instead of 30-40 minute ones and then it&#x27;s still a win in my book.\n\n          You described pretty well my almost-suburban New England spot. I walk everywhere, because there&#x27;s stuff everywhere. There&#x27;s a guy down the street who built an add-on to his house and his wife runs a convenience store out of it. It&#x27;s great. The problem is that there are (particularly American? I don&#x27;t know) pathologies around <i>ejecting</i> from the idea of a community that you see in even those relatively tight-packed suburbs, and what you describe, while great, flies against that.<p>My parents (who are themselves not really the sort of folks you&#x27;d expect in an urban core, ha) didn&#x27;t last in Iowa very long. They moved back to New England and while they live on like three acres now, they&#x27;re friendly with all their neighbors in a way even I&#x27;m not in my relatively approachable community.\n\n          &gt;  There should be (light) commercial development.<p>There is. (both example pictures above have a commercial development less than 10 minutes walk away).<p>The problem is that there isn&#x27;t enough commercial need for every single development to have it&#x27;s own commercial block -- we already have a large overabundance of commercial space in the US as it is, adding even more of it inside each residential development doesn&#x27;t magically spring forth a business to fill it.<p>(this is true even at city-level densities -- as lots of urban 5-over-1 developments are struggling to keep their ground-level commercial&#x2F;retail units sustainably filled)<p>And since we <i>do</i> need more housing, pressure builds to just convert the commercial back into residential anyway...\n\n          Some new developments in the US are &quot;mixed use&quot; which emulates what you described.\n\n      My first thought looking at that first &quot;new suburb&quot; photo was: where&#x27;s the sidewalk? And the second photo has sidewalks but no visible amenities.<p>Sure they&#x27;re denser, and townhouses are at least less materials-intensive to build, but I&#x27;m curious how this is otherwise an improvement on the old planning model of swathes of detached homes?\n\n        &gt; I&#x27;m curious how this is otherwise an improvement on the old planning model of swathes of detached homes?<p>It&#x27;s not. (Or at least, I&#x27;m not arguing it&#x27;s better). My only point is that &quot;more density&quot; isn&#x27;t the magic bullet fix people sometimes think it is -- because the US <i>is</i> doing a <i>lot</i> more density than we historically have in the past 60-ish years, and it&#x27;s not meaningfully different in terms of lifestyle or planning.<p>If you want good alternative public transit, you have to just decide to build it <i>first</i>, and you kind-of have to do it almost everywhere nearby. (not just Division St, not just Woodward Ave, not just Hiawatha Ave, etc).<p>&quot;Crank up density&quot; doesn&#x27;t magically result in a &quot;car-free&quot; city. You can&#x27;t townhouse your way into having the Chicago Elevated, you have to actually decide to build the L. (similar to, say, Seattle SoundTransit)\n\n          This is what is happening in the US city I reside in. Developers are gobbling up land and putting in “high density” housing, but without building any additional amenities or restructuring roads that make the area more enjoyable to live in. And this is in a city with very libertine zoning rules, so mixed use is not restricted. The price&#x2F;foot is about the same for the higher density housing as it is for a house and a yard just a 10-20 min drive further out, so given the choice between high density&#x2F;no amenities&#x2F;no parking&#x2F;not walkable&#x2F;surrounded by high speed roads vs a house with a yard and a garage (will have to drive in either scenario)…I’ll take the bigger house and the yard.\n\n      Those new suburbs are just as bad. They squeeze more people into less space while retaining all the issues of the original suburbs and adding a mass of people on top.<p>A proper suburb should be a mixed-zone small town with proper public transport and amenities you can walk to like European suburbs are.<p>Here&#x27;s Farsta (10 km from Stockholm): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;oAgBhNkvQFw5BVS16?g_st=ic\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;oAgBhNkvQFw5BVS16?g_st=ic</a><p>Here&#x27;s Västerhaninge (30 km from Stockholm) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;iGkzuzPC8y188teh8?g_st=ic\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;iGkzuzPC8y188teh8?g_st=ic</a>\n\n        I think I have see a lot of places like this in US. The difference is most housing is apartments and rents usually are higher than mortgage payment for twice the size of house.\n\n    &gt; quintessentially North American overreaction to a quintessentially North American problem.<p>The article is mostly about London.\n\n  Do you have any children? I can&#x27;t imagine car free city is good when you have two or more young children. For one, groceries are a problem as you likely need to stock more food to cook. Sure you can go to the store every other day but that takes a lot of time and is more expensive. Plus you are on a lot tighter schedule. Most people with kids race home to pick up children and don&#x27;t want to stop by the store and schlep back groceries.<p>Then you have just the stress of taking kids on public transport. You have to carry around a lot of things (snacks, drinks, diapers or change of clothes, toys and books, etc). You normally put that in a stroller but that&#x27;s a huge pain to manage on a bus or subway.\n\n    Japan seemed to have invented the mamachari [1] for that sort of thing.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nippon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;features&#x2F;jg00091&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nippon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;features&#x2F;jg00091&#x2F;</a>\n\n    I live in a city with two young kids. We do <i>very</i> little driving. We live an easy walk to the grocery store and school. A bus stop is on the corner, with buses every few minutes. A car really isn&#x27;t necessary, and the kids <i>like</i> taking the bus, though we don&#x27;t do it often. For longer trips, a backpack gets stuffed with snacks and stuff, and we&#x27;re good to go. The only thing we use a car for regularly is to get to swimming lessons, which is a bit off the beaten path.  None of the things you bring up are a problem for us at all.\n\n      That&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m happy for you.<p>For me, getting to my parents would take me 2 hours vs 30m and I&#x27;d have to adhere to a strict schedule. inlaws would take maybe 4 hours versus 1.5, since there is much better transit to them. So basically my kids would see them a lot less often at a much greater expense.<p>Shopping locally would cost me an extra few hundred a month and take me maybe 20 hours extra a month.<p>If the kid is sick I&#x27;d have to schlep him to the doctor which would take 30m each way as opposed to a ten min car ride. Hope it&#x27;s not raining.<p>I can also drive to more restaurants so I have more choices<p>Having a car is a convenience that makes my life considerably easier. I gladly trade money for time and convenience. And I can often even get both with more options form shopping\n\n        The experience of going car-free in a place designed around cars doesn&#x27;t tell you much about what it would be like to live in a car-free city.\n\n    &gt; Do you have any children? I can&#x27;t imagine car free city is good when you have two or more young children. For one, groceries are a problem as you likely need to stock more food to cook. Sure you can go to the store every other day but that takes a lot of time and is more expensive. Plus you are on a lot tighter schedule. Most people with kids race home to pick up children and don&#x27;t want to stop by the store and schlep back groceries.<p>Millions of people with children in larger European cities live without requiring a car to buy groceries, bring their kids to activities, etc. Also when kids are old enough the transportation infrastructure is available for them to be independent and go do their things by themselves.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how you cannot imagine that this already happens, in many places, and it&#x27;s not an issue at all.\n\n      On top of that… cars have only been around for about a century. Plenty of people raised kids before then.\n\n        Prove it!\n\n        Well most kids would be productive human resource as soon as they are able to walk without support in that past. They would also keep themselves entertained with other kids on the street and may also get fed in neighbor&#x27;s home plenty of times.\n\n      I grew up in the US in a small city. My parents owned a car periodically, but only one, and the vast majority of my peers were in car-less families.<p>We all did most of everything day-to-day just fine between walking, bikes, and busses. The kids over say 6 mostly transported themselves to wherever they were going without their parents. Of course, we also NEVER took our toys, clothes, or books outside of the house (wtf???) nor snacks (we ate and drank at meals) and only brought clothes somewhere if we were planning on staying the night there. If I needed clothes I&#x27;d carry them myself. I literally couldn&#x27;t imagine my parents carrying around my clothes at a point that I was physically able to carry them myself. The thought makes me laugh. For babies there are diaper bags, my parents never needed more than a single diaper bag even though they had multiple kids in diapers at the same time.<p>Not having a car only was a problem for day trips, like the amusement park 60 miles away. We&#x27;d always make sure to bring friends and family who didn&#x27;t have a car whenever we went to those sorts of places.\n\n    I have children.  12 and 8, but we were also in Taiwan once earlier when they were  5 and 1.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to get around.  The MRT stations are nothing like the ones in the US.  Bathrooms are incredibly well kept and clean at every station.  If anything, I feel like it&#x27;s easier than pulling strollers in and out of a trunk.  That said, the sidewalks are very questionable in many parts of the city once you are off of the main roads so there is some danger for small kids.<p>But Taiwan may also be somewhat unique in that relatively few folks cook in their daily lives due to the low cost of eating out (really amazing place if you love food).  Additionally, markets tend to be quite abundant so you are rarely going very far to get food.  Houses tend to have smaller kitchens and smaller refrigerators as well so you don&#x27;t store as much food as you would here.<p>The US is somewhat unique because of the high friction of getting food.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why we can have businesses like Instacart and we have such large refrigerators because the friction and cost of transport to get food is so high.\n\n      I still think it has to be more efficient to eat out and let economies of scale take over than for each of us to cook. I even say this as an avid home cook. It&#x27;s incredible that in the US it costs orders of magnitudes more to have an efficient machine of humans and logistics produce the food\n\n    I live in Europe and I used to cycle everywhere myself when I was a kid.\n\n      I live in the US and I did the same when I was a kid - cycle, walk, or bus. Not everywhere, but many places. I even took the bus to the mall with my friends when none of us had any money because it was something to do.<p>I couldn&#x27;t imagine being a kid and living in a location where the only way I&#x27;d be able to go anywhere was to have a parent drive me. No thanks, ugh.\n\n    In Manhattan, there was a supermarket on almost every block.  Going to get groceries was only slightly longer than the trip to your refrigerator.  I remember food being more expensive in Manhattan, but on a recent vacation to Paris, food was cheap and extremely high quality.  Similarly in Italian cities a few years ago.<p>Things are structured differently in large cities around the world to accommodate a walking lifestyle.<p>As for schlepping baby stuff around, it&#x27;s inconvenient but a relatively short period of your child&#x27;s life in the scheme of things.  But I do suppose it would be a grind if you have 3 or more children and going through that baby stage for many years on end.\n\n    &gt; You normally put that in a stroller but that&#x27;s a huge pain to manage on a bus or subway.<p>Not in any bus or subway car build in the last 20 years.<p>In every EU city I rode mass transit in the last decade, all transit vehicles are &quot;low side wagons&quot;, meaning you can just roll on from the platform&#x2F;curb, the doors are wide and the area right behind the door is a large space for wheel vehicles.<p>People bring wheelchairs, strollers, bikes, ect. without any problems, without needing help getting on. The platforms have elevators, for the people not comfortable taking a stroller onto an escalator.<p>The only exception I can think of are historic drams, but those are rare.\n\n    I can easily fit a Costco run on my e cargo bike.\n\n  It sounds like you&#x27;re saying it works for tourists. How would I get a massive CostCo shop home in Taipei (or similar large amount of shopping)?\n\n    you must also ask the question why you want to make a huge shopping trip.<p>If you lived in a world where accessing the shop was easy and convenient, <i>and</i> they stocked everything you need, <i>and</i> you didn&#x27;t have oodles of storage at home to store it all: why would you even make such a huge shopping trip?\n\n      It&#x27;s precisely this.<p>The culture and organization of the city means that 1) most folks have relatively small kitchens and small refrigerators, 2) actually, most dwellings are quite small in the first place so there isn&#x27;t so much space to store large stockpiles of goods, 3) markets are abundant and easy to access, 4) the cost of eating out is so low that many folks do not have a habit of cooking at home and often just eat out.\n\n      So your plan is for people to have a longer commute to work, work 8 hours at the job, have a longer commute home, and then have to trudge to a shop in the evening most nights of the week (in all weathers)? Sounds idyllic. Food shopping every night can replace going to the gym or playing with your kids. And if you&#x27;re elderly and would rather drive - tough luck.<p>&gt;&gt;If you lived in a world where accessing the shop was easy and convenient, and they stocked everything you need, and you didn&#x27;t have oodles of storage at home to store it all: why would you even make such a huge shopping trip?<p>Well obviously no-one is going to buy food they can&#x27;t store. If they live in a tiny pod then by all means subsistence shop on a daily basis. However, the groceries will also be far more expensive.\n\n        The MRTs in Taiwan run very tight schedules with high frequency.  Commutes are relatively short.  Most folks go out with their kids and get food together (Taiwan being known for their night markets).<p><pre><code>    &gt; However, the groceries will also be far more expensive\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s counterintuitive, but groceries and food are actually very cheap in Taiwan.<p>Seeing is believing.\n\n        Here, &quot;somewhere in Europe&quot;, you can order groceries online and get them delivered to your door for cheap. This kind of service really took off during COVID and then stuck. I guess people found it convenient.<p>We usually still go to the store, but use this service when we have a large amount of shopping to do as it just is... convenient. Instead of driving to and running around in the store looking for all the stuff we need and then carry it out to the car and into the home, we just gather around the iPad in the comfort of our living room and order what we want. The day after it shows up at the door. It&#x27;s fantastic.\n\n        How is driving to a costco, parking on a giant parking lot, walking through a massive store, loading up a cart, walking the the cart to your car&#x2F;truck, unloading everything, returning the cart, and then driving home at all efficient?<p>People do giant shopping trips exactly because the whole process is so cumbersome.<p>The US has the longest commutes of any country in the world because of urban sprawl and zoning. Car-free cities offer an alternative to that way of life.\n\n          Door-to-door, a Costco trip usually takes me about 90 minutes. I go to Costco probably once every two weeks.<p>Just a data point. I&#x27;d love to hear how often urbanites go to the grocery store and how long each trip typically takes.\n\n            If you go once every 2 weeks, where do you get your fresh fruit and veggies? Do you just live off of frozen food? Do you plan all your meals 2 weeks ahead? What if you have people coming over for dinner on short notice?<p>Urbanites still have the option to go to a big-box grocery store. Mine is an 8-minute drive away, but we just never go there.\n\n              Ah, Costco isn&#x27;t the only grocery store I go to. Roughly, I grocery shop once per week, alternating between Costco and other grocery stores where I buy fresh foods or smaller items that don&#x27;t make sense from Costco.<p>My personal feeling is being able to stock up in bulk is a net timesaving benefit of car-centric living, BUT the tradeoff comes when you only need a few things from the store. On the one hand, it&#x27;s only about once or twice a month that I need to go to the store because I need just 2-3 very specific things. However it&#x27;s a major annoyance, and it&#x27;d definitely be nice to be able to walk a short distance to get them.\n\n            Didn&#x27;t see any replies with specifics, so here&#x27;s mine: Door-to-door, it takes me no more than 30 minutes for a shop, and I usually go 3 times every 2 weeks. So about the same as you. I wouldn&#x27;t consider my location &quot;lucky&quot; either: there&#x27;s 3 supermarkets alone within a 5 minute cycle from my house. Across most of the city, you&#x27;re always going to be close to one.\n\n          &gt; The US has the longest commutes of any country in the world<p>I lived in Mumbai starting 7:30 in morning I reach office by 10AM after changing buses and trains. Leave office at 6:30 -7 in evening and hit home by ~10 pm. And even those days I worked in IT so not exactly among poor who have to live far away.<p>Claiming US commute being longest is just ignoring how billions outside North America&#x2F;Europe lives.\n\n            It turns out you&#x27;re right. Thank you for the correction.\n\n        The issue you&#x27;re having is not understanding how it can be.<p>The lucky truth is that this is not some hypothetical situation, it&#x27;s a lived reality for me and many more people in Europe.<p>I&#x27;m 34 and I don&#x27;t even have a drivers license; that&#x27;s freedom. I never needed one.<p>That said: I&#x27;m not really talking about an <i>absolute</i> reality (IE; no cars at all). <i>Reducing</i> car usage actually helps those that really need to use a car, like the disabled, the elderly, people hauling large things (such as when they move homes) etc;<p>Groceries aren&#x27;t far more expensive, but the inner city stores are, on average 5% more expensive than larger stores of the same brand. 5% on your groceries is vastly under the tax burden of maintaining huge roads, the accidents they cause (which has a healthcare burden) and even disregarding that: fuel cost and mileage on your vehicle (which increases insurance rates and decreases the longevity of your car).\n\n          I live in Europe as well.<p>I can understand not owning a car, but never learning to drive is like never learning to swim. Driving is a life skill, whether you own a car or not.<p>Groceries are a lot more than 5% more expensive in a corner shop vs out of town supermarket.\n\n            Getting your drivers license is also very costly, must be transferred when you move country, in countries like Sweden (where I live) you have to retake your test every 10 years.<p>It also requires a lot of time to do anything with it. It&#x27;s an administrative document, like a passport. You can say &quot;getting a passport is important&quot; and I&#x27;d believe you, but better to get it when you need it rather than pre-emptively, because otherwise you&#x27;re wasting valid years.<p>I find often that when we do things like taking a drivers license we feel like we are incentivised to use it, when we use it we purchase vehicles and register them and then we have sort of a sunk cost feeling. Once you&#x27;ve invested all that time and cost <i>using it</i> feels cheap so you are more likely to use it.<p>On the flip side, because I don&#x27;t have a license I make subtle decisions to avoid using a car, so my life is relatively car-free, on the very rare occasions I do need a car I can hire someone and it works out significantly cheaper in the long run.\n\n              Chacun à son goût. I&#x27;d prefer not to have to rely on other people. Also, if you change your mind learning to drive is a lot harder when you&#x27;re older.\n\n                &gt; I&#x27;d prefer not to have to rely on other people.<p>Same, that’s why I don’t want to depend on the fuel supply chain or the regulation of a car, or the upkeep of the roads.<p>I know that in certain cities in China they have little lotteries on which cars are allowed to drive each day based on how their license plates start as a way to avoid traffic situations. (they still have traffic situations).<p>(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S1361920922003583\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S13619...</a>)\n\n            I never owned a car, never felt the need to. I have learned to drive as a young adult, but unlike swimming, I never found that skill actually useful. If I had to drive a car today I would rather take some lessons first anyway, as there&#x27;s no way I could actually drive safely otherwise. It&#x27;s very easy for me to imagine much better ways to spend the money used to learn how to drive and much more useful &quot;life skills&quot; to acquire.\n\n        Yeah, what a big trudge, walking to the corner grocery for some food for dinner. A ten minute trip.\n\n    In large cities you have many small supermarkets within a short walking distance from your house. It takes 20 minutes to do a quick shopping run to pick up what&#x27;s needed. It&#x27;s true that groceries are more expensive than at Costco...but you also don&#x27;t need a massive deep freeze + pantry to keep all of your extra stuff, or a big car to carry it all in.\n\n  &gt; Indeed, it is jarring when we returned to the US.<p>No place is a panacea. Berlin surely has its issues. But Europe and Berlin in particular is very nice for this expat from the US. I love that I pay basically nothing out of pocket over what’s taken from my taxes for healthcare. The trains are basically ubiquitous and at least near me just refreshed with new cars. We walk basically everywhere and take transit also. I’m far healthier than when I was stateside driving everywhere. The food has far less harmful things in it. Etc etc.<p>My cousin who lives in Japan says similar things about Japan. He’ll never go back to Canada where he’s from. The feeling is similar to me and the US though I’ll be bringing my family home to the US eventually because I miss home and the potential for stupid high salaries and what that might do for my retirement fund. But yeah. Europe for the win for the time being.\n\n  I find cities in Taiwan frustrating to navigate without personal transport, at least a bicycle.<p>Having lived in Kaohsiung for a bit, I observed that very few people use public transport unless they go to&#x2F;from intercity rail or airport. Buses in particular are unreliable (mostly used by older people), and MRT alone is obviously not enough for the sparse city.\n\n    <p><pre><code>    &gt; I find cities in Taiwan frustrating to navigate without personal transport, at least a bicycle.\n</code></pre>\nComplete opposite experience; we found it actually enjoyable to navigate without personal transport.<p>Some days, we walked &gt; 10 miles; goes perfectly with stuffing your face with street food.<p>To be fair, we were there as tourists and only for 12 days, but in any of the major metros, we did not feel like our experience would have been better with a car.  Maybe bikes.\n\n      As tourists, it is likely you didn’t have to get places on schedule. In regular life it becomes a bottleneck.\n\n  In the early 70&#x27;s at the behest of airlines Congress passed a law that prevented Airports and State&#x2F;Local governments from sharing cost of Municipal Rail lines. Which is why in the US if there is a rail connection it&#x27;s always a separate feeder. I only learned of that a few years ago when congress repealed it.<p>There is also an unwritten law in the US that the government isn&#x27;t allowed to make changes that would interfere with an established business charging monopoly rents. Putting a subway stop at an airport would devastate the business of taxi, limo, and parking concessionaires. Also can you imagine if you had a layover at an airport and could get on the subway, go downtown and have dinner, then come back?\n\nCar free cities are great but you have to have a lot of problems solved for them to work . You need high density, lots of public services from libraries to pools all these need to be close. Public transport has to be safe so you have to actually enforce laws and arrest vagrants. Car free needs a lot of things to go right where car full cities can be pretty disfunctional\n\n  &quot;Do you like car free cities?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh yes!&quot;<p>&quot;Cool, Get out then.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=925wmb-4Yr4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=925wmb-4Yr4</a>\n\n  That’s not true. 2&#x2F;3 of Parisians don’t even own a car and Paris is a very average city when it comes safety. Density is also pretty low for one of the biggest European cities.<p>And it’s just a known example, there are a lot of cities way smaller than Paris where it’s easy to live car free.\n\n    The French work week is 7 hours so they get an extra hour to fuck around with public transportation a day. So that might help quite a bit. Still I’d be curious how upper middle class folks with kids survive without cars. Maybe that 33% covers the affluent folks with kids tho.\n\n      Are you saying here that you think traveling by metro in Paris takes an hour longer than driving would?\n\n        Yeah if you have to change transit method it adds a lot of extra time. So metro+ bus adds at least half an hour each way\n\n      I don’t think it’s a class issue because money won’t buy the inexistant parking lots around schools. Also money can actually buy you really nice bikes.<p>It’s just that driving a car in Paris is hard and awful.<p>I lived in a city of &lt;1M inhabitants for the first 5 years of my son’s life without a car (in fact I had one but never used it for day to day life). Public transports and bikes can get you far faster than any car in rush hours. I’ve never had more than 30-40min between my door and my office, including depositing my son. The few times I did it with the car it took me the same time thanks to traffic and it was far more stressful.<p>And it was in France, where public transports are ok-tier but far from top notch in Europe.<p>Also the 7 hour day is pretty false. That’s the minimum time of a full-time job but most people are working 39-40 hours. It’s just that the extra hours are paid or are compensated with off time.<p>In practice you’ll only work 7h&#x2F;day if you are at the minimum wage.\n\n      35 hour work week is for government employees. Obviously, there are a lot of them but there are still more nongovernmental employees who don&#x27;t have the benefit of a government job or unions that work a typical 35-45hr&#x2F;week.<p>&gt; Still I’d be curious how upper middle class folks with kids survive without cars.<p>All my middle class friends the kids walk. Everywhere. There are public restrooms everywhere. There are buses, parks, libraries, supermarkets, stores everywhere.\n\n        I fully believe it’s possible if the density is there and the services are there to go with them. In the USA we  sometimes get the density but not the public services and spaces.\n\n    2&#x2F;3s sounds like a lot but it would be better to count how many households have no car.<p>And the US is covered with cities that can be lived in car-free; but the tradeoffs are too great for most people. (By definition any rural town that’s about a square mile or two is walkable.) Cars are so cheap and so good that most everyone grabs one when they can.\n\n      2&#x2F;3 is very realistic even for households. It is just prohibitive time wise (it takes more times in most cities to go by car than by train) and parking wise (densities is high, parking is on the street, searching a parking slot up to an hour, ...). You do not want to own a car.\n\n        Greater Paris has a 60-65% car ownership rate among households [1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ceicdata.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;france&#x2F;motor-vehicle-ownership-per-household\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ceicdata.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;france&#x2F;motor-vehicle-ownership-p...</a>\n\n          Nailed it on finding the relevant statistic that’s representative of the actual situation\n\n          That&#x27;s pretty good though depending on what &quot;greater Paris&quot; is I suspect it&#x27;s a bowl - trending to 99% ownership the further from the center you get.<p>The goal shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;car free cities&quot; it should be (at least in the USA) &quot;first get it so households feel one car is fine&quot;.\n\n            Totally agree. Mix it is. Car free is only possible in high density, high public transport coverage inner cities.<p>Grande Paris is definitely not the zone I put my 2&#x2F;3 statement on.\n\n      Distances are one thing, existing pavements&#x2F;walkways another.\n\nPlus car travel is dead time since you’re forced to pay attention to the road at least somewhat.<p>I’d rather have a longer journey that is hands free\n\n  I see what you&#x27;re saying, but long road trips are not that way for me. I am easily lost in my own boredom and thoughts on the road. All my good ideas seem to emerge then.<p>(Perhaps, unfortunately, to a lesser degree I &quot;multitask&quot; when city driving as well.)\n\n    I find looking through a window of an S-Bahn to be a superior thought generator.\n\n  I have never been able to make use of the longer transit time on a bus when commuting, because they are always standing room only or shoulder to shoulder with barely enough room to hold a phone\n\nNot even sure how you&#x27;d start off hating the idea. Less noise, less pollution, shorter commute, cheaper infrastructure, more green, more walking, improved health...I mean...just off the top of my head I&#x27;m thinking of tons of advantages. I can&#x27;t think of a single disadvantage. The only reason I need a car is because the city &#x2F; neighbourhood is configured around the expectation that everyone has a car.\n\n  If your entire life is based around your car, it&#x27;s your most important and powerful symbol of autonomy, wealth, and personal liberty. The prospect of someone in government deciding one day that the life you live is no longer welcome and your touchstone is evil is incredibly jarring, at the very least.<p>If you also live in an area where you cannot imagine how you could possibly live without using your car frequently, the prospect of a car-free city sounds a lot like you&#x27;re being hung out to dry by people who don&#x27;t care what happens to you.<p>These reactions are a combination of poor messaging by those affecting change and a failure of a imagination by the car-bound. The first, at least, is avoidable.\n\n    &gt; it&#x27;s your most important and powerful symbol of autonomy, wealth, and personal liberty<p>Cars as virtue signaling? I&#x27;m not quite sympathetic to this case. This person&#x27;s liberty is causing harm to everyone else and I don&#x27;t care for their symbol of wealth. I&#x27;d like to say, &quot;get off my lawn&quot;, were the lawn is actually my city. My liberty of not being polluted by noise and fine particles, and of easily and safely moving on as a pedestrian or biker, and of my earth&#x27;s climate not being harmed is important as well.<p>People could have their cars outside the city, reachable with good public transport, so it&#x27;s not even like they couldn&#x27;t have their symbol of wealth somewhere.<p>It would also make sense that people don&#x27;t have their personal cars in cities. We could have car sharing systems like we have for city bikes, which work great. Most cars sleep most of the times, this doesn&#x27;t make quite sense. We could have fewer cars achieving the same usefulness with better a organization less focused on the individuals.<p>Maybe a solution is that the car stops being seen as a symbol of wealth and liberty, and more like a liability &#x2F; necessary evil, because this also doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Wanting to look wealthy is already a cursed concept. Why should anyone care that anyone looks wealthy? This is not what&#x27;s important in life. What you think and what you do matters much more.<p>Of course, this is a very good point, and this needs to be addressed. To be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing with you, I&#x27;m agreeing.\n\n    &gt; […] <i>and personal liberty.</i><p>Ironic given that driving is not a right—you need a license—and is highly regulated (e.g., insurance), while you can walk and cycle without any of those things.<p>A cop can stop you in an automobile and ask for all sorts of documents, while doing the same walking or on a bus&#x2F;tram&#x2F;subway would probably be against most countries&#x27; constitutions.<p>See the <i>Oh the Urbanity</i> video &#x27;“15-Minute City” Conspiracies Have It Backwards&#x27;:<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DpXqY_j1m1U\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DpXqY_j1m1U</a>\n\n      I&#x27;m pretty sure a cop can stop you and ask for ID in most of the world, even most of the west, for no reason.\n\n        &gt; […] <i>for no reason.</i><p>Not in Canada:<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccla.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;Know-Your-Rights-Booklet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccla.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;Know-Your-Rights...</a><p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffreismanlaw.ca&#x2F;when-do-you-have-to-identify-yourself-to-toronto-police&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffreismanlaw.ca&#x2F;when-do-you-have-to-identify-y...</a><p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collettreadllp.com&#x2F;know-your-rights&#x2F;can-you-refuse-to-show-id-to-the-police&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collettreadllp.com&#x2F;know-your-rights&#x2F;can-you-refuse-t...</a><p>Further, you don&#x27;t have to carry ID and can&#x27;t get into trouble if you don&#x27;t have any if walking.\n\n          Canada is a bit like the US. I would imagine France and Sweden to be the same. But I&#x27;ll be very surprised if cops need a reason to ask for ID in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, ...\n\n      &gt; while you can walk and cycle without any of those things.<p>A few years ago a driver making a right-on-red bumped me in the crosswalk with his car. It was reckless but whatever no harm no foul. But then he got out, incorrectly thinking he had the right of way, and demanded my &quot;papers.&quot; He was incredulous and furious that I didn&#x27;t have insurance papers to show him, or thought I was refusing to. He ended up calling 911 about it, though they didn&#x27;t come.<p>Ever since then I can&#x27;t get some questions out my head. Is that really how he thought it worked or was he just flustered? Do other people think like this? This was a middle-aged guy in a suit in a major city&#x27;s business district, so presumably some sort of professional. Is he good at his job?\n\n        Probably just trying to frighten or intimidate. Someone else could easily have been fooled into thinking they needed papers. The guy could&#x27;ve berated them into tears. Probably just about all he was attempting to do.\n\n          It doesn&#x27;t have to be deliberate. For a lot of people, aggression is their immediate defensive response.\n\n  Because that scenario isn&#x27;t universal, and while you can&#x27;t think of a reason, others can. Perhaps someone would rather shop at Costco because they&#x27;ve got a big family and need to buy items in higher quantities. You can&#x27;t get a Costco in a small city setting, so you need to drive there, and even if you could, shared transit isn&#x27;t amenable to getting home the types of things you buy at Costco. Or perhaps you wish to have a single family home with a yard, but work for a company with an office presence downtown, and need to take your kid to daycare on the way to work. You could do that on mass transit, but would spend less time if you could plot your own course and just go. Your ideal situation may not need a car, but it&#x27;s not a universal situation. As for noise, my suburban neighborhood is pretty quiet, and I live across from a park, so I&#x27;ve got plenty of green. I also happen to love driving, so I don&#x27;t mind that the grocery is 10 minutes away, because I enjoy getting there and back.\n\n    &gt; Because that scenario isn&#x27;t universal, and while you can&#x27;t think of a reason, others can.<p>Thank you very much for this island of sanity inside this topic’s sea of bewilderment. These comment sections always seem to end with someone up asking: “How could anyone like things I don’t like??” and then a bunch of commenters just shake their heads and conclude “Those poor souls, they don’t know how they are suffering.”<p>I’m ambivalent about cars. I could take ‘em or leave ‘em. What I won’t compromise on is I will never voluntarily live in a dense urban environment or really any structure with shared walls on shared property, including apartments, condos, townhomes, anything like that. Since affordable detached single family homes can’t really be found right next to the places I need to go, like work and shopping, I am forced to have a car. Or more accurately, my strong preference in housing type necessitates a car.<p>It’s not that I want my car and like to drive 15 minutes to shopping. My car is a pain in the ass that’s always broken down and driving is dangerous. My car is the price I pay to avoid living in a city.<p>EDIT: And to be perfectly clear: I am not against cities building themselves toward car-freeness. I support citydwellers making their cities bikeable and walkable! I just don’t want to live there.\n\n      I appreciate your comment as well! I feel like I&#x27;m off on Preference Island sometimes, so it&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m not.<p>I particularly appreciate the point you make about prioritization. When I left school and started working, I lived in an apartment downtown, walked to work, hung out afterward at bars and stuff, and loved it. At that point in my life, I didn&#x27;t need a car, and was fine. I&#x27;m older now. I&#x27;ve lived in an apartment, a townhouse with shared walls, and now a single family home. I&#x27;ve loved every place I&#x27;ve lived because, at the time, it was the right place for me. I want a yard for my dog to run in and my kid to play in, and like you, I wish to prioritize my living structure above all else. Unlike you, I do like my car. The beauty is we&#x27;re both adults who know how to prioritize our lives and make choices that let us do what we want, and similarly let others live their lives.\n\n        Not to be a downer, I do sympathize with all you wrote here. But its not a simple as, people have different preferences and we should let everyone do what suits them. Cars have major externalities that harm the environment and affects the well-being of others.\n\n          Also extremely rigid ideologies and a Pol-Pot-like approach to reality (as if in: &quot;If someone does something that I don&#x27;t like, he should not be allowed to do it&quot;)  have huge externalities.\n\n            Well it seems like we’ve hit Godwin’s law already, so this is probably a good point to stop.\n\n      Absolutely, it&#x27;s a trade-off. In many parts of the country, people cannot make this trade-off though. it&#x27;s cars or nothing, even in the more &quot;urban&quot; zones with condos, apartments, etc...\n\n      <i>&gt; EDIT: And to be perfectly clear: I am not against cities building themselves toward car-freeness. I support citydwellers making their cities bikeable and walkable! I just don’t want to live there.</i><p>Are you willing to pay to account for the externalities that your preferences create? If so, I&#x27;m all for it, but let&#x27;s be real: most folks aren&#x27;t.\n\n    <i>&gt; Or perhaps you wish to have a single family home with a yard, but work for a company with an office presence downtown, and need to take your kid to daycare on the way to work. You could do that on mass transit, but would spend less time if you could plot your own course and just go. Your ideal situation may not need a car, but it&#x27;s not a universal situation.</i><p>These are definitely preferences that exist, yeah. How do you propose we account for the externalities created by executing on these preferences?\n\n    Yeah, but if you make large enough buys in a dense city, getting items delivered is a good option. It&#x27;s generally much cheaper than in sprawling areas, since a single small delivery truck can probably make 3-4 stops in the same neighborhood.\n\n  One disadvantage is that many people do travel outside the city to go to an office in the suburbs, to visit friends, and to do weekend activities. I think everyone I know in Boston&#x2F;Cambridge (which has relatively decent--really!--public transit) who isn&#x27;t a very recent college grad owns a car.\n\n    I went to school in Boston&#x2F;Cambridge, without a car, and was absolutely flabbergasted how much more convenient the city was with one when I graduated. It was like I hadn&#x27;t known what I was missing. Places I thought of as &quot;far apart&quot; were really only a 15-minute drive from each other.<p>Getting to the airport really stood out. I thought of it as a two-hour trip, because I had to walk to a bus, then transfer to a train, then another train, then another bus. It took less than half an hour in a car. As a student, the difference in fare between mass transit and a taxi was enough that I couldn&#x27;t swing it (dating myself--this was before Uber&#x2F;Lyft), but I had essentially been trading my time for an extremely low amount of money when I look back at it.\n\n      I did as well. The reality was that we leaned on the people who did have cars <i>all the time</i>. To play Thursday night hockey, to buy booze, to get to Chinatown for dinner faster... And, yes, given I was usually carrying luggage I took a taxi to the airport--which is admittedly not a common trip for the random consumer on a personal trip.<p>I know a couple who live in SF without a car, as much as a statement as anything else. And I see them making a lot of use of Uber, Zipcar, conventional rentals, and weekend visitors who have a car.\n\n        I didn&#x27;t know <i>anyone</i> on my campus with a car, but I did learn a life hack by accident as a sophomore that I played to my advantage for the rest of college:<p>If I booked my flight to campus at the beginning of the school year with a very tight connection somewhere, I could run and make the flight, but my luggage would not. Then they would have to deliver it to me at my dorm in a day or two when it arrived!<p>I would just pack enough for a couple days in my backpack and wait for my suitcases later!\n\n    I think this is kind of overstating the case, tbh. I don&#x27;t even live in Boston anymore--I live on the South Shore--but I drive my car maybe once a week, usually to Home Depot or rarely on a pilgrimage to Micro Center. I bought a place where I could walk to a commuter rail stop (it&#x27;s how I get to my office) and multiple supermarkets are within walking distance, so I bring a backpack. About half a dozen restaurants within a twenty-minute walk, another dozen or so if I go another ten minutes further. A couple weeks ago I walked to a museum in Quincy in like 45 minutes, it was really nice.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t not want to have <i>access</i> to a car, but if car&#x2F;truck rental wasn&#x27;t such a mess, I would be happier without one. (When I bought this place I cut back the 4+ car driveway to two cars and reclaimed a bunch of yard, and it was great. I wish it could&#x27;ve been more!)\n\n      I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re disagreeing. I do need a car to go anyplace. But even if I only used it on weekends, I&#x27;d almost certainly own one because of, as you say, the friction associated with renting something.\n\n        Yeah, sorry, I meant to reply to &#x27;smeej&#x27;s post, not yours. :)\n\n    When I lived in Boston, the thing that kept most of my friends from driving during weekdays was how profoundly aggressive the drivers tended to be. There are very few cities where I&#x27;ve seen that level of road rage\n\n  Yeah basically the reason is that people are imagining their current built environment, which (especially in the US) is often solely and exclusively designed for automobiles, and imagine it without cars. It’d be a legitimate nightmare.<p>What we need is gradual but rather aggressive pressure against cars that allow cities to adapt their services and layout. Congestion taxes and getting rid of parking are really great first steps.<p>In the US cars are also a big symbolic thing due to children being pretty much totally incapable of living independent lives until they’re 16 and get a car (or their friends do), also due to aforementioned built environment.\n\n    The &quot;gradual&quot; part is hard because so many changes need to happen at once for a lot of these things to be feasible. Being able to get halfway to where I&#x27;m going affects me the same way as not being able to get there at all.<p>If you try to limit cars without adding better last-mile options (especially in the U.S. where huge portions of the population don&#x27;t regularly walk even one mile at a time), people can&#x27;t get anywhere, but if you try to roll out last-mile options without limiting cars, people either don&#x27;t use them because they can still use cars, or they get hit by cars.<p>Add to that that everyone seems to feel time-crunched as it is (who do you know who feels like they&#x27;re getting enough rest and doesn&#x27;t describe themselves as &quot;busy&quot; any time you ask how things have been?), and the switch from &quot;I could cover a mile in 2 minutes at 30mph vs. 20 mins at 3mph&quot; and no one wants to change.\n\n    &gt; getting rid of parking are really great first steps<p>Getting rid of parking in an area where people <i>need</i> cars is the worst possible early step. If you&#x27;ve ever lived in such an area you&#x27;d know the chaos it ensures.<p>The way to do it is to make alternatives be more attractive. Most people don&#x27;t actually want to spend the money on cars and insurance and maintenance. So if you build infrastructure to make alternatives be cheaper and easier, lots of people will use them, organically reducing car usage without forcing misery on anyone.\n\n  From my experience, a lot of the hate that car-free cities and &quot;15 Minute Cities&quot; get is from fearmongering from far-right voices on social media.<p>They&#x27;re totalitarian ploys that will be used to track your every movement and have the government dictate when and where you can go. They&#x27;re a plot to create new ghettos for &quot;undesireables&quot;. They&#x27;re to take away your freedom of movement. They&#x27;re completely antithetical to America! Blah blah blah.\n\n  I don&#x27;t have a car and I&#x27;d love my city to be car free.<p>But some people think they need their car because they think they need to move a lot of stuff regularly, for instance between their home and their parents, and their parents don&#x27;t leave in a place easily reachable without a car. This stuff can include pets, like cats. I think some of these people could do things differently, but maybe some of these people might genuinely have these needs.<p>Going to work daily to a place that needs a car is another concern. Sometimes at times outside the public transport hours. Very good public transport could mitigate this. But some people might also need to move a lot of stuff (tools, materials) for work, which might be complicated with public transports.<p>And when you move, public transports won&#x27;t cut it.<p>But we could have almost car-free cities that allow these specific cases (possibly with special authorization), addressing most people &#x2F; most cases with good public transport.\n\n    &quot;But some people think they need their car because they think they need to move a lot of stuff regularly, for instance between their home and their parents, and their parents don&#x27;t leave in a place easily reachable without a car. This stuff can include pets, like cats. I think some of these people could do things differently, but maybe some of these people might genuinely have these needs&quot;<p>And, precisely, who the f..k are you to think you can JUDGE the needs of other people, and what other people &quot;need&quot; or what they just &quot;think they need&quot;?\n\n      I didn&#x27;t.<p>That some people having a car could do without is a certitude but I can&#x27;t know who.<p>You know, when writing this paragraph, I had a friend in mind for who I think it would be hard. Especially when this friend would prefer not to have one.\n\n  In the place I love in now, there is a shoprite right across but I can&#x27;t walk to it cause a highway cuts across. Google maps says there&#x27;s an alternate route. Tried to walk through that route but had to give it up when I saw a pedestrian don&#x27;t cross sign\n\n  There are certainly disadvantages.<p>I live in a very car-unfriendly city that invests heavily in public transport. Amongst other things, this implies that they don&#x27;t invest in things like car parking space. Most residents don&#x27;t have cars and cannot have cars because there are far fewer parking spaces in apartment blocks than the number of people living there. Problems include:<p>1. My wife (who runs a small service business) is constantly having customers miss appointments and explaining it as &quot;I spent 30 minutes trying to find somewhere to park, failed, and had to return home&quot;. Being unable to actually use a business at all because you can&#x27;t park anywhere isn&#x27;t an issue you see in most cities, but here it happens all the time. You might wonder why don&#x27;t they just park on the outskirts and take public transit the rest of the way, and the answer is that train stations don&#x27;t have much parking either, and at any rate public transport is usually 2x or worse slower than with cars (best case), so often they just don&#x27;t have enough time in their lunch breaks or after work to do that. With a car friendly city, people can pop out to a local business and back in the time they have available.<p>2. The city is also very keen on recycling. Bin bags are extraordinarily expensive because they are heavily taxed and it&#x27;s illegal to use any other kind of bag. Fine for small objects, but what about when it&#x27;s time to recycle something large like a TV or a carpet? The actual solution they push on you: there are special trams that a few times a year park at certain stops, and then you are expected to just carry the full recycling load down there with your arms. You could also buy a little trolley and use that. Is it raining that day? Maybe you&#x27;re traveling and away from home? Too bad, wait another 3-4 months or so and keep the junk in your apartment whilst you do so. With a car: put the stuff in your boot and go to a fixed recycling point that&#x27;s always open. Easy.<p>3. Car-free cities become completely dependent upon the goodwill of their public transit unions, who then exploit that dependency to earn themselves vast salaries and perks. Tube drivers in London can earn more than senior software engineers and have final salary pensions, even though the job is mostly automated and on many lines consists of pushing a button to move to the next station.<p>4. Transit systems are very centralized and prone to widespread system failure due to poor maintenance, e.g. if points or signaling fail at a busy junction half the city can grind to a halt. Roads are more robust because cars can normally pull over if they have problems, and people can drive around the rare car that&#x27;s got stuck in the middle. Roads degrade much more smoothly than railways do.<p>5. Public transit systems invariably run at a loss because ticket prices are set too low for the actual overheads involved. Roads usually raise more in taxes than they cost to maintain.<p>6. Obviously, there&#x27;s all the practical downsides that come from not having a personal space like sometimes not being able to sit together with your family, or sit at all.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are many positives and conveniences but it&#x27;s silly to say there are no disadvantages to going all-in on public transport. There are many serious disadvantages which is why cars caught on to begin with.\n\n    These largely seem to be a function of how it&#x27;s done where you are, not how it has to be. Your points are generally solvable.<p>1. Have a park-and-ride outside the urban area but with good public transport connections. These can have a lot of parking, and (at least where I live) are encouraged by the parking fee being €1 if you then use public transport into the city where cars are slow anyway.<p>2. Then have better recycling&#x2F;rubbish systems. Here there are two options: you can call the city and they&#x27;ll arrange a pickup, or you can wait until a specific day of the week when they do large items. Also, if you order something large (a new TV say) the supplier is obliged to offer to take the previous one away.<p>3. If they earn such, then they&#x27;re clearly in sufficient demand, and are providing an important and safety-critical role. They&#x27;re arguably doing a lot more good for a city than many software engineers.<p>4. Better maintenance. Unmaintained roads are also bad.<p>5. There&#x27;s no problem running at a loss if it improves the overall life and economy of the city. Some places even set the price at free because of the benefits it brings (sadly not mine.)<p>All this said, you&#x27;re not wrong in the sense that everything is about tradeoffs. If there were no tradeoffs there wouldn&#x27;t be a discussion to be had and everyone would use whatever was obviously the best. For myself, I prefer a more liveable city and happily that&#x27;s the way where I live leans. There&#x27;s still plenty of driving (to my annoyance sometimes, cars are big, dangerous, and prone to clogging the place up for other modes of transport) but they discourage it by lowering speed limits and restricting through-traffic. So it&#x27;s possible but less attractive than going by bike or tram or whatever unless you have a special case.\n\n    This is a very late comment, but in case anyone else is looking at this thread in the future:<p>A quick google search [0][1] seems to prove #5 false, specifically the bit about roads bringing in more in taxes than they cost to maintain. The first article is from 2011 and is about the US.<p>[0] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirg.org&#x2F;edfund&#x2F;resources&#x2F;do-roads-pay-for-themselves&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirg.org&#x2F;edfund&#x2F;resources&#x2F;do-roads-pay-for-themselve...</a>\n[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urban.org&#x2F;policy-centers&#x2F;cross-center-initiatives&#x2F;state-and-local-finance-initiative&#x2F;state-and-local-backgrounders&#x2F;highway-and-road-expenditures\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urban.org&#x2F;policy-centers&#x2F;cross-center-initiative...</a>\n\n  Maybe you need to get somewhere fast at night; public transport doesn&#x27;t usually run all night. Also, you might find your commute to work requires multiple hops. Public transport might be crowded to save costs, and that might be terrible if you are pregnant or need to take someone elderly somewhere. Taxis are expensive and some drivers are dishonest. I&#x27;ve had people tell me they were abused by taxi drivers.\n\n  Single disadvantage? There are a few. Cities are more expensive to live in than anywhere else, have higher crime and more restrictive laws, and almost literally no privacy. Having to own a car is an expense but it is far cheaper than the difference in housing costs alone. Big city life is best for the rich or people with high-paying jobs and no kids.\n\nI have to live in a bubble then. I never heard people express hate of care free cities, but I hear the opposite all the time, people complaining how horrible car-centric cities are.<p>But I’m a Western European who lived in cities all my life, don’t have a driving license, and has zero interest in cars ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯\n\n  Never move to the US - you’ll find yourself behind the wheel of an F350 with triple gun racks before you know it and not even realize it ;)\n\nI would have expected the article to give some clear pool&#x2F;metric&#x2F;statistics about &quot;people hate the idea ... &quot;. There are indeed loud people and big interest groups that oppose car free cities, but I am not sure about &quot;people&quot; in general.<p>Sure, you need means of transport and to be able to live, and you can&#x27;t change things over night, but if you would ask people &quot;would you prefer to have a supermarket 5 minutes away or one 20 kilometers away&quot; I doubt anybody would say &quot;no I want only things far to be forced to use a car&quot;.\n\n  How about one 5 minutes away where I can go with my car? Which I feel like these people are trying to stop...\n\n    If your single car is rivalrous to several other people&#x27;s ability to live and work in the urban core, yes, that&#x27;s a pretty good reason to discourage the car.<p>Massachusetts has park-and-ride, and it&#x27;s pretty great!\n\n  &gt; but if you would ask people &quot;would you prefer to have a supermarket 5 minutes away or one 20 kilometers away&quot; I doubt anybody would say &quot;no I want only things far to be forced to use a car&quot;.<p>For most people it&#x27;s not about the supermarket. Those are a dime a dozen and all the same. It&#x27;s easy to provide those in sufficient amounts everywhere.<p>Now try it with jobs. Not any job, but your job. Is it possible to have your job be 5 minutes from your home. How about in 5 years when your job is underpaid or unfulfilling? Is your next job also 5 minutes away? Or do you now have to move? And 5 years after that, when you&#x27;re laid off?<p>I find that loads of people start out enjoying the car-free experience. And then they get a job in the next town. And&#x2F;or they get kids, so commute-time takes away from kids-time. Life becomes too busy to spend the extra 30 minutes commuting per day that public transport would cost.<p>Between the trade-off bad job, no time, and car&#x2F;public transport, the car quickly becomes the best solution. Even if you don&#x27;t like driving.\n\n    Sounds like moving should be made easier.\n\n      It&#x27;s much easier if you rent an apartment and don&#x27;t own much stuff--which is a trade-off itself.\n\n      There&#x27;s also questions around a partner. Can you only have relationships with people whos career is near your current employer?\n\n        Something something dense cities and good public transport. You can get from one side of Berlin to the other - not including suburbs - in half an hour and without needing to park.\n\n          It&#x27;s certainly possible, but more difficult the larger the city. Actually my main concern would be transporting furniture, appliances and the cost of renovations and maintenance. Transport of large items is difficult without cars. Cost of renovations are often many fold higher for dense housing due to greater difficulties with waste disposal and higher transport costs.\n\n      That would be great, but your forebears locked in a great prop 13 basis decades ago and it would be worth more than your raise to give it up. Or you&#x27;re in faux social housing in the form of a rent controlled apartment and don&#x27;t want to give up that subsidy.<p>Or there simply aren&#x27;t homes to move to that are closer because every municipality in the area has tried to build offices rather than homes since the 1970s. And thus the office park around your new job is itself so big as to require a car to traverse it.\n\n    This is the crux of the matter - when people worked at a company for life, they could build their life around it.<p>If you know you’ll be commuting to The Factory for the next forty years, you can happily take the bus or train or whatever to it. You buy your house and put down roots.<p>Now cities are larger and your job changes every five to seven years and either you move each time to be near enough, or you let your family stay where everyone they know is, and take the commute on the teeth.<p>The solution is <i>smaller</i> cities; not larger ones, or going back to longer term employment.\n\n      &gt;&gt; If you know you’ll be commuting to The Factory for the next forty years<p>That was not the norm historically. Average job tenure is longer now that it was in the past. And the typical manufacturing facility lasted nowhere near forty years. The average lifespan of a factory is around 10 years. Most companies aren&#x27;t around for forty years.\n\n        &gt; That was not the norm historically. Average job tenure is longer now that it was in the past.<p>Stats on that?<p>The norm for most people used to be to work for the same company most of their career (if not all of it) and retire from there with a pension.<p>Nowadays most people change jobs every couple years.\n\n          &gt;&gt; The norm for most people used to be to work for the same company most of their career (if not all of it) and retire from there with a pension<p>Stats on that?<p>That absolutely was not the norm. Again, most companies did not exist long enough for someone to work at one for their entire career. Median job tenure 40 years ago was around 4 years (BLS).<p>A minority of private workers were covered by pensions at the highest point, and being covered by a pension plan did not mean you got a pension. A company might have required 30 years of service to get a pension. Work there 29 years and 11 months, get fired, no pension. Work somewhere ten years and then decide you hate it? Either work there another 20 years hating it or quit and lose your pension. Job hop for a raise every few years? No pension. Many pensions were not adjusted for inflation. Many pension plans went bankrupt. Pensions sucked. I know, I have one from the 90&#x27;s. Worked there 7 years, that pension is going to pay me roughly the same monthly amount as I will be able to take from my last year&#x27;s contributions to my 401K, even if those contributions make no investment returns before I retire.<p>I have no idea how young people get these fantasy ideas about the past. And do you really want to work in the same place for 40 years? A 401K is better than a pension. A 401K, Roth IRA and HSA is immensely better than a pension.\n\n            &gt; Work somewhere ten years and then decide you hate it? Either work there another 20 years or quit and lose your pension.<p>That&#x27;s not usually how it worked.<p>&gt; I have a pension from the 1990&#x27;s. Worked there 7 years. I&#x27;ll get around $150 a month when I retire<p>As you yourself note. You didn&#x27;t lose your pension by leaving after 7 years, you  still get it. Sure it&#x27;s minimal because you only worked there 7 years instead of 40 but you didn&#x27;t lose it.<p>&gt; I have no idea how young people get these fantasy ideas about the past.<p>I wish I was that young but I also will eventually receive a pension from a company where I worked for a few years in the early 90s. It&#x27;ll be like $100 but I only worked there a few years.\n\n              &gt;&gt; you still get it<p>Different plans had different limits. Mine was 7 years, I stayed just long enough to get it. If I had left a few months earlier, would have lost it. Pensions suck.\n\n    Isn&#x27;t the job thing _easier_ if you live in a denser town? If you have more jobs per km² you&#x27;re less likely to need to move when you switch job.\n\n      Maybe yes maybe no. A lot of the jobs in a big city metro are out in the burbs. Until fairly recently, my company&#x27;s only office in the area was a 45 minute drive from downtown. There are more tech jobs in the city proper than there were 15-20 years ago when there were approximately zero. But a lot of the jobs in the area are still spread around the suburbs and exurbs.\n\n        I don&#x27;t think proponents of the &quot;car-free&quot; or &quot;15-minutes&quot; cities have:<p>- supermarkets are super close<p>- everything else is super far (including workplaces)<p>- you don&#x27;t have a car<p>in mind. I don&#x27;t think that in London (the main example in the article) most jobs are a 45 minute drive from central London nor that most people drive to work.\n\n          &gt;nor that most people drive to work<p>That&#x27;s probably true in Boston as well. But that&#x27;s because, if you work 45 minutes out of Boston--of which there are many companies along the Route 128 or 495 corridors--you probably don&#x27;t live in Boston unless you&#x27;re a die-hard urbanite willing to put in a long commute to your suburban job. (To be fair, a lot of the west coast companies that established Boston outposts are in town and local suburban companies increasingly have options for people to work in a city office (or remotely) if they want to.)\n\n    &gt; <i>Is it possible to have your job be 5 minutes from your home.

The car is both the fastest and the most convenient if the roads are wide and the buildings are sprawled around. If you build the city tightly so it&#x27;s easy to walk everywhere and everything is nearby, you a) don&#x27;t need a car and more importantly b) there is no room for cars, this space is recovered for humans.<p>Disclaimer: my household owns two cars.\n\n      I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;everything&quot;. I&#x27;m talking about jobs. Your job. Is your job so generic that almost everybody in your country can do it? Because that&#x27;s what you would need for this to be realistic. Everybody living so close to enough jobs of the exact type they desire. Not just a job title, but the industry, the size and type of company, the salary level, the type of people, and a bunch of other things.<p>And even if it were realistic, you&#x27;d have more choice by widening the circle anyway. Get an even better job by driving a bit.\n\n        You&#x27;re so focused on driving I feel you&#x27;re missing the point of designing the space so driving isn&#x27;t necessary. Your axiom is &#x27;work is far away&#x27;.<p>But the point is it only happens if it&#x27;s convenient to be far away. Design your city in a way it&#x27;s convenient to be nearby and it&#x27;ll be nearby. The problem is this design is completely at odds with private car ownership.\n\n          &gt; But the point is it only happens if it&#x27;s convenient to be far away.<p>No. The point is that &quot;work&quot; isn&#x27;t a generic thing like &quot;supermarket&quot;. A specific job is something that needs to fit your personality.<p>If you&#x27;re the type of person that really digs working for big tech, you aren&#x27;t going to find a job you enjoy in some small town. You can probably find a job maintaining the website of the local bank, but are you really going to think that&#x27;s a good outcome?<p>Hell, for big tech the jobs aren&#x27;t even commutable from anywhere if you <i>are</i> willing to commute by car. Or helicopter. But this problem goes for loads of people in loads of jobs. If you can commute further you have more choice. More choice gives you better odds at a job you like.\n\n            I completely agree, it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s nothing stopping those office jobs to be created next to train stations. Except there aren&#x27;t enough conveniently located train stations... turns out there are in Paris and London though?<p>Car dependence is a feature of sprawling cities. If you make your city dense, the jobs will be there. The fact that everyone has a car makes the jobs be all over the place because if employees can&#x27;t commute further, the jobs will move to them. It&#x27;s pure game theory.<p>The big question is how to jump from a stable state of car dependence to a stable state of mass transit and I don&#x27;t see a way to do that in general.\n\n          &gt; Design your city in a way it&#x27;s convenient to be nearby and it&#x27;ll be nearby.<p>How can you possibly have every job be nearby to everyone? That&#x27;s just not possible. Now factor in job changes or even career changes. Unless your primary criteria for picking a job is to have it nearby, the probability of having jobs far from home approaches 100% over time.\n\n        Jobs of a given type tend to congregate in specific locations.  Tech in Silicon Valley.  Finance on Wall Street.  Politics in DC.  Entertainment in LA.<p>So picking a geographic location based on your field and having a lot of job options is workable for a lot of occupation categories.\n\n    We lived car free life in our 20s before kids.<p>Groceries were a total PITA, maybe if you order a lot of delivery it’s fine, but we cook every meal and needed at least a granny cart at least once a week. And small grocers nearby had terrible vegetables; there is a lot of variance in supermarket quality. Maybe in NYC they have it figured out, but the trade off is everything cost crazy money.<p>I commuted by bus for this time to work, an hour each way and my hours were beholden to an infrequent bus schedule — it knee capped my career because I had to leave at hard cutoff and never could meet up for lunch or happy hour, and lost 10-15 hrs a week on a bus.<p>Even subway is so-so, unless they run every 5 minutes and you live and work on top of statio  can add up fast, and transferring lines adds a ton of time.<p>Huge regret trying to live car free in an American city (not NYC).\n\n      Just for contrast. I&#x27;m living a car free life in my mid-late 20s at the moment in Denmark, and I rarely ever order delivery.<p>Supermarkets are close enough (I actually live above one, but were that not there, there are still three others within a five minute walk), that I rarely do a &quot;weekly&quot; shop and just buy my groceries when needed, most of which are of decent to high quality.<p>It&#x27;s not really much of an inconvenience to keep a relatively well stocked kitchen without a car here. I&#x27;m really struggling to understand how a &quot;granny cart&quot; worth of groceries once a week is a chore? That&#x27;s a couple of bags worth at most.<p>Buses could be a bit more frequent here, but they&#x27;re still good enough that I don&#x27;t have a hard cut off for when I have to leave the office. I lose maybe 7-8 hours a week on my commute, which is time I&#x27;d spend reading anyway.\n\n        Oh I think one big factor is it was a 1 mile walk in 32C degrees and swampy high humidity.<p>It wasn’t a couple of bags, it was a cart of about 4 bags at least, including a gallon of milk, often including bags of flour, eggs, etc.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;LS-Folding-Shopping-Basket-Capacity&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01K07MF8C&#x2F;ref=asc_df_B01K07MF8C&#x2F;?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=241950654450&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11751146125161984154&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9007536&amp;hvtargid=pla-465948337831&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=5df59d8e0be93189b8a8cc8b20caefc6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;LS-Folding-Shopping-Basket-Capacity&#x2F;d...</a>\n\n          Ah. Yeah, a mile in that kind of heat and humidity would have me rethinking my shopping habits and choice of lifestyle as well.\n\n          Electric bike? Electric moped if you wanna stretch\n\n            This was 20 years go. I actually wish Segways became a thing. They could climb stairs, took up less area and could carry a heavy load balanced by the gyros.\n\n        How many children do you have?\n\n          None. But neither did the GP when they were living car-free in their twenties.\n\n      &gt; Maybe in NYC they have it figured out, but the trade off is everything cost crazy money.<p>Yes, living in Manhattan and Brooklyn, this was not a problem.  Manhattan had a supermarket on every block.  Brooklyn was a little farther, but the variety and quality of the food was excellent.  This was a while ago, so don&#x27;t remember how prices stacked up.  Just that on an NYC salary, food was affordable for our family.<p>Lived in Tokyo and Osaka, but most of that time didn&#x27;t have to cook much.  But remember groceries being very accessible in walking distance.<p>Vacations in various cities in Italy and Paris, groceries were accessible, very high quality, and affordable.<p>So I think walkable grocery shopping is a good experience in NYC and big cities outside the US.  But probably not great in the median US city.\n\n    I’ve lived and worked in London all my life. Of all the ways I could get to work, driving has to be at the bottom of the list.\n\n    &gt; Between the trade-off bad job, no time, and car&#x2F;public transport, the car quickly becomes the best solution<p>If you beat public transport by using a car then there just isn&#x27;t enough public transit or the city isn&#x27;t dense enough (likely the former, due to the latter). If you live 3km from your job in London or NYC then at least during rush hour it&#x27;s likely to be faster to use public transport than a car.<p>&gt; Life becomes too busy to spend the extra 30 minutes commuting per day that public transport would cost.<p>This is again based on the premise that public transport <i>costs</i> time, rather than <i>saves</i> time or doesn&#x27;t matter time wise.<p>People who work in really dense cities but live far outside it so they need to drive from home are already likely to not drive all the way into the city center but rather drive to the edge of the city center, park there more cheaply, and take a train the last 10% of the way. The key is that that traffic in the city center is slower than public transport, <i>including the wait times and walking required</i>. Within some distance from the city center of a city that is dense enough and has enough public transport, this holds true. And it&#x27;s in this area that private car traffic make little sense at all. But that doesn&#x27;t mean people can&#x27;t have cars. Or that suburban people won&#x27;t drive. You might still want to drive somewhere on the weekend. Or you might need to drive to even reach the public transport.\n\n      <i>IF</i> you live in a city with enough density that public transport beats the car most of the time, and <i>IF</i> your job is in that same area too, then yes, going car-free can save time. But you need several hundreds of thousands people in the same-ish spot for both those assumptions to hold true for most people. And probably also some badly designed roads.<p>I live in a town of 125k people, where I can reach any spot by bike or public transport in about 30 minutes. Perfectly commutable. It has a few jobs for people like me, but not enough for a decent amount of variety.\n\n        &gt; I live in a town of 125k people, where I can reach any spot by bike or public transport in about 30 minutes. Perfectly commutable. It has a few jobs for people like me, but not enough for a decent amount of variety.<p>Car-free center can work there too. But for 125k people it might just be a few blocks square in the middle. The math is pretty simple. If density is so low that there can&#x27;t be stations every 5 minutes of walking, or so low that businesses like large detached grocery stores, gas stations, building material stores and so on could even <i>think</i> of being there, then it&#x27;s 100% car territory.<p>But one shouldn&#x27;t let it become self-fulfilling. If city restaurants have parking then they need a lot of space, which lowers density, and they become unattractive to people who are walking. So a key ingredient for a car free city could be to ensure no establishments have parking lots within a specified distance of the city center. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to combine parking lots with walkability.\n\n          I agree with all of that. And in fact, that is what this city has. The car-free center thing works very well. You get a few large parking garages around the center, and inside you do everything on foot.<p>The rest of the city is spacious and has good car accessibility, so you can also get out quickly.\n\n      &gt; This is again based on the premise that public transport costs time, rather than saves time or doesn&#x27;t matter time wise.<p>This is a reasonable premise. Because a car is point to point and public transport by definition is not. I agree it is possible to maneuver yourself into a situation where you live immediately next to the subway stop and your job is immediately next to the other subway stop. Public transport will save time then. But that&#x27;s very rare and also a fragile setup because as soon as you change either home or job, it&#x27;s no longer true.<p>So for most people public transport means walking to the nearest stop, taking the subway&#x2F;bus and then walking to the destination. So yes it takes more time.\n\n    &gt; Is it possible to have your job be 5 minutes from your home.<p>If you live in a major city, yes.<p>Mid size cities and smaller, this is much more difficult.\n\n    &gt; Between the trade-off bad job, no time, and car&#x2F;public transport, the car quickly becomes the best solution. Even if you don&#x27;t like driving.<p>I quit a job of mine in the New York metro area, largely because I had to drive there. It was hell. Every time it rained the commute would be twice as long. One wonderful evening coming back home the usually 50 minute drive took 3 hours.<p>Additionally the stress of having to deal with bumper to bumper traffic and the assholes and distracted drivers on the road was slowly killing me.<p>I swore after that job to never drive to work again. At least on a bus&#x2F;train I can usually read a book, twiddle with a laptop or something else that keeps me entertained&#x2F;relaxed.\n\n  Good luck walking 5 mins with 6 or 8 bags of shopping, a five year old and a baby in a pushchair.<p>All these arguments for car-free cities are mostly supported by young, single and childfree urbanites.\n\n    This is what a cargo bike is for.\n\n      It&#x27;s mad that you can&#x27;t see that strapping two kids and 8 bags of shopping into a cargo bike and cycling 10 minutes is far worse than doing the same errand by car.\n\n        Worse how? Worse because we&#x27;re all used to ignoring the negative externalities of driving everywhere? Worse because our kids are used to acting however they want in the back seat of a car? Worse because we built these horribly isolating daily transport systems where people tint their car windows so we can&#x27;t even see each other and then yell at each other&#x27;s driving abilities?<p>The point is that of course it&#x27;s true that driving is &quot;easier&quot;, but it&#x27;d be obviously worse in a lot of ways if we didn&#x27;t build cities the way we did.\n\n          &gt; isolating daily transport systems where people tint their car windows so we can&#x27;t even see each other.<p>You bring up a lot of good points, but why is this a bad thing?\n\n        This hasn&#x27;t been my experience.\n\n        Not as mad as imagining that everyone without a car does this onerous strawman version of your errand.\n\n          Do you think they would rather swap? What is the weather like where they live?\n\n    Not everyone can or has access to a car so people still have to and do manage that in the car-centric world you&#x27;re advocating for as well. Except now it&#x27;s more like walk a mile, wait for the bus, walk another mile.\n\n      Yes, and it is objectively worse.\n\n    You buy 6 or 8 bags or groceries every day?\n\n      Who wants to go to the store every day to buy food? Don’t you have a refrigerator?\n\n      You want people to go to the store every day? God forbid people want to relax after work.\n\n    There are plenty of alternative solutions compared to outright banning cars. Nothing beats telecommute for speed, safety and emissions for example, but even EVs can mitigate air pollution in cities. They also comfortably beat human powered transportation as soon as someone looks into the carbon footprint of agriculture. Efficiency can differ by orders of magnitude.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;ghg-kcal-poore\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;ghg-kcal-poore</a>\n\nThe open paragraph regarding London is very much &#x27;of now&#x27;.  Air pollution in London in the 2000s has been the lowest it has been in over a century.  The Great Smog of 1952 killed perhaps 10,000 people over a very short period.  And the article doesn&#x27;t make clear the ONS-estimated 36,000 a year deaths is across the entire UK <i>not</i> just London.<p>It just feels like the modern journalism&#x27;s trend for hyperbole and over exaggeration.  That&#x27;s not to say that pollution shouldn&#x27;t be reduced as much as possible.  It&#x27;s not so bad that you don&#x27;t see tens of thousands of runners and cyclists in and around London every single day.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Smog_of_London\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Smog_of_London</a>\n\nThe title is a bit hyperbolic. It&#x27;s mostly about reducing the number of cars in the urban core, improving public transit, and making the infrastructure more pedestrian and bike-friendly. Which, while easier said than done, is a lot more achievable than being literally car-free--especially in more than a fairly small area.\n\nWhat&#x27;re you talking about? It&#x27;s awesome driving 25 miles each way to and from work in this city with more highway miles per capita than any other city in the country.<p><i>sits down at desk; starts breathing exercises to calm the anxiety from the Mad Max-esque driving on the interstates</i>\n\nThere&#x27;s probably also a bit of selection bias going on. People who prefer car usage will be less likely to go live in places where car ownership is difficult. The longer a city is &quot;car-free&quot; the more of that bias will accumulate.<p>There&#x27;s really not much in the article to suggest that the same people are first against and later in favour. It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that some people prefer to live in car-free places, but that&#x27;s all you can conclude without doing polling the <i>same</i> people before and after a change to car-freeness.\n\n  N of 1 here, but I&#x27;ve lived extensively in both environments. Love cars, got my licence on my birthday the first day I could apply.<p>That said, I&#x27;m noticeably happier and healthier whenever I don&#x27;t need to own one. My quality of life is higher when living somewhere everything is accessible by walking and by efficient public transport.\n\n    Well, I&#x27;m an N of 1 too :-)<p>I&#x27;m lucky to live in a place that gives me plenty of options. And I have a tech workers idea of tenure, in that I change jobs every few years. So I&#x27;ve done them all.<p>Cycling to work is the best. When the sun shines and birds are singing. It&#x27;s a miserable experience when it&#x27;s pouring rain and the headwind is strong.<p>Public transport is kind of nice for reading, or catching up on a bit of sleep. But it takes forever, and you&#x27;re dependent on its schedule. And the walk on both ends is only fun in spring and summer. Umbrella&#x27;s make it less bad than cycling when it rains, but it isn&#x27;t great.<p>Driving is annoying when the traffic is bad, but it is by far the fastest for everything over a few kilometers. The roof and the AC protect against the worst of the weather. You have full flexibility on when to go. And while a podcast or audiobook isn&#x27;t as good as a newspaper or ebook, it&#x27;s not bad either.<p>Also, you can fart in peace.<p>Honestly, the whole &quot;shops are nearby&quot; are such an uninteresting part of the car-free discussion to me. I have to get to work more often than I have to get groceries. And nowadays, I just get them delivered, just like everything else.\n\n      Yeah, there&#x27;s definitely a sparsity cutoff where it stops working so well.<p>Possibly a climate one too although Londoners and Parisians manage fine.<p>I get the impression our experiences of car free living were at different densities. Public transport is a slower, more difficult compromise at one end and car travel&#x2F;ownership is a burden at the other.\n\n  People tend to gravitate to what&#x27;s easy for them. I live in a Boston exurb and I decided to pass on a dinner get-together last night because I just didn&#x27;t feel up for over 2 hours of driving roundtrip and parking to go into the city.<p>I&#x27;m sure if I lived in the city, I would still own a car but I&#x27;d probably be much more inclined to do urban activities on the weekend than getting out my car and driving it someplace. And I&#x27;d favor a job that I didn&#x27;t need to drive to even if it came with trade-offs.\n\n  That&#x27;s okay. Not every city needs to be equally car-free. Let people naturally gravitate toward the type of city they want, and we&#x27;ll actually end up with more diversity than we currently have.\n\n    Yeah, I agree. I&#x27;m not actually against more car-free neighbourhoods, in fact we could do with more. Also more congestion charges, and other kinds of pay as you go road fees.<p>I just really dislike the intellectual dishonesty of headlines like this.\n\nAnecdotally, in Houston at least, it does seem true that people come back from travel abroad and talk about walking around, using public transit, and if renting a car, only for drives through the countryside or a particular tour. And then complain about having to resume a tedious commute. It’s almost a cliche, like study abroad students coming home with new affectations.<p>Or, if they went to certain other places, complaining about how terrifying the traffic was, like “you wouldn’t believe these roundabouts, there were no signs, mopeds everywhere, it was lawless! traffic worse than here!”<p>To some maybe the connection is more obvious than to others, but as they say, you can lead the horse to public transportation but you can’t make it vote for people who support allocating resources for it.\n\nAs someone who has worked in London for many years, the difference is amazing. Biking in the city is now enjoyable, and the air quality is (subjectively, even without the data) dramatically better.<p>There was an incredible resistance to the recently introduced ULEZ (Ultra Low Emissions Zone) expansion, but I&#x27;m incredibly grateful for the sake of my children, if nothing else, that it has been pushed through.\n\n  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve shortened my life for having lived in zone 1 for so many years due to air pollution.<p>Cycling around London is also the fastest way for an astounding radius of travel. I can beat uber and the underground for most journeys using a Lime bike.\n\n  I remember about 20 years ago I was taking my bicycle on the train, and this involved a transfer through London. You can&#x27;t take full-size bicycles on the London Underground, so I cycled across London from Kings Cross to Waterloo, and I definitely remember being reasonably terrified the whole way. If that has greatly improved since then, then that&#x27;s wonderful.\n\n    That&#x27;s a pretty short journey (probably about 15 minutes), but yes it will definitely be a lot better now. I think also part of it comes down to 1. getting used to it, and 2. the time you cycle at. Rush hour, while more hectic, actually is quite a bit easier because you&#x27;re often going far quicker than any cars.\n\n  The lack of those smelly poor people also makes for a nicer environment.\n\nI&#x27;d quibble with the title. Based on my experience in London, most middle-class&#x2F;white collar workers love car-free living. Most blue-collar workers don&#x27;t like it. They continue not liking it once it becomes reality. (Although maybe they realize that it&#x27;s not as bad as they feared).<p>I think this is basically another example of political polarization, combined with employment patterns. White collar workers broadly speaking place a higher value on their time and mostly belong to &quot;tribes&quot; that value their health and environment. Removing cars is great for that as bikes give control over journey times (and in most cases in e.g. London reduce them) while positively impacting the other.<p>Blue collar workers may not be able to do their jobs with just a messenger bag containing a laptop and airpods. Also, their political identity has been dragged further towards the radical-individualism end of the spectrum where collective action on e.g. environment is hard, and trust for bossy health authorities telling them to exercise more is low.<p>The slightly strange side effect is that you end up with an item which is way cheaper (a bike at e.g. school dropoff vs a car) that becomes a signifier of social status. I am sure there are loads of examples of this phenomenon but none spring immediately to mind!\n\n  I don&#x27;t think most advocates for reduction in car dependency in urban environments think that trades people shouldn&#x27;t have vehicles to carry tools and materials around in.\n\n    The title of the article mentions car-free cities. I don&#x27;t interpret that to mean that a Ford F-150 is fine, do you?\n\n      The title may imply this but the article really doesn&#x27;t. Go to an actual &quot;car-less&quot; area of a city like Brussels and there are delivery vehicles at least in the morning, work vehicles of various kinds, street sweepers, etc. Even at the relatively extreme end of pedestrianized malls, there are still a fair number of vehicles around.\n\n        These are being targeted too, at least in the Netherlands. They were given a free ride for a while (pun very much intended) but now trade vans are also coming under the hammer.\n\n      I think this is one of the most extreme real-world examples of a &quot;car-free&quot; city, but they still have vehicles for taxis, public transport, public works, trades people, deliveries, etc:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R2oD1ZHNMFE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R2oD1ZHNMFE</a>\n\nI would pay an additional 10% tax if it would be earmarked to public transportation.\n\nMore anti-car drivel. Sure there must be a balance but car-free isn&#x27;t the way and won&#x27;t be a thing. They had to scrap the Streatham Wells LTN after a three-mile bus journeys took two hours - and not everyone can walk three miles, let alone the entire route.\n\nSo, living in one of those cities (AMS) I have a few takes. I&#x27;m not ranting, just expressing my frustration:<p>1. Cars exists because they are more comfortable. I don&#x27;t care that biking should better, it&#x27;s not when it rains sideways, it&#x27;s cold and windy. Biking sucks. I would pay top money to not be in a bike, not be outside getting drenched, and usually do ubering everywhere to the dismay of Dutch people,<p>2. Cities designed around biking are uber tied to public transport. I&#x27;m a lefty, I think that&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not, because the first time there are cuts to public service you find yourself living in the middle of nowhere and can only bike, because cars are too expensive to own. This happened in the Netherlands with NS slashing intercity trips, and increasing prices. I had colleagues now that now to live several hours per day in a packed commuter train. I can&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s better.<p>3. Any type of DIY activity becomes a nightmare. Want to rent move a couch? Good luck! Back home, you could load the thing on a nice Volvo and be happy.<p>4. Electric bikes are effectively not policed because it&#x27;s the new thing we need to incentivize, and it becomes immediately super dangerous. I know people that had serious injuries because of crashes. Cars are inherently safer, especially modern SUV like volvos or tesla,<p>5. Accessibility becomes a nightmare, especially if you are in a wheelchair, your commute times are going to skyrocket,<p>All this &quot;bikes are amazing&quot; just reeks of some bad degrowth ideology. There is a duality between cars are bad and hydrocarbons are bad. Except they are literally the engine of growth, and for some reasons we decided that we should phase out hydrocarbons and replace them with some silly not reliable energy alternative (solar, wind). I can&#x27;t see how this ends in a different way than how it went in Europe with our energy policy.<p>Cities are meant to grow and drive the economy, not to be Disneyland parks. If I want to bike I can go to Italy on a seaside town, I don&#x27;t need to bike 356 days a year.\n\n  &gt; 4. Electric bikes are effectively not policed because it&#x27;s the new thing we need to incentivize, and it becomes immediately super dangerous. I know people that had serious injuries because of crashes. Cars are inherently safer, especially modern SUV like volvos or tesla,<p>Starting to get interesting in Finland. Not yet bicycles, but scooters with weight over 25kg or speed over 25km&#x2F;h or 1kw will soon require insurance...<p>And likely any bike with specs over those will also be a moped and thus require both insurance and registration...<p>I see no reason why those sort of limitations won&#x27;t come more prevevalent.\n\n  I think I agree with all your points, but I also think we should be doing all we can to encourage all those people who can and want to cycle to do so, and to make it as safe and convenient as possible. That&#x27;s regardless of whether you &quot;allow&quot; cars to still be used. Improving cycling infrastructure is an action that causes benefits and very little in the way of disadvantages.<p>Any journey that someone makes on a bicycle means one less car clogging up the road. That&#x27;s an argument that people make who are militantly against cars, but I think it&#x27;s completely valid even if you think cars are things that are here to stay and you&#x27;re OK with that. Car drivers should be looking at the people cycling and silently thanking them for making their drive more pleasant because the roads are less busy. But for that to happen, the bicycles need to be able to go on dedicated cycle ways so that cars don&#x27;t have to slow down to drive around them.<p>My commute to work is about 45 minutes on the bus. Or 50 minutes walking - that&#x27;s how much the buses suck, and they&#x27;re actually fairly good buses as far as buses go. Or it&#x27;s a 25 minute cycle. It&#x27;d be a 10-15 minute drive if there was no traffic and there was actually somewhere to park, which there isn&#x27;t.<p>I did spend about 15 years without a car, cycling everywhere I went. It was great. One time I bought a bulky item, and called a taxi for it. I dumped the item in the taxi, told the driver where to meet me, and cycled home. I made it there before the taxi did - the driver looked well annoyed. But I recognise the cars are useful - I have a car now, and it&#x27;s great for heading out into the countryside in sparsely populated areas to do some hiking. It&#x27;d be unreasonable to expect any public transport out there, and the car will always have a place serving those areas.<p>So, my argument is that we should be making things better for all, not pitting two views against each other.\n\nI don&#x27;t hate the idea of living in car-free cities.<p>It&#x27;s cities I hate the idea of living in. Which is why I choose not to live in cities. And is why I need a car. Fuck cities, I hate &#x27;em.\n\n  You don&#x27;t need a car, you want a car. Plenty of people live without cars. Even outside cities.\n\n    It&#x27;s far more cumbersome outside of cities because of distance&#x2F;time and unreliable alternate transportation. It might as well not even be an option, if one decides to go without then they are consciously absorbing the inconvenience because it&#x27;s an important ideological issue to them.\n\n      No they&#x27;re choosing to live somewhere.\n\n        Not even sure what you&#x27;re trying to say here. People tend to live where they work, and that can be rural areas. If you&#x27;re saying they should be faulted for that choice, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Few people move there in the first place, mostly young people leave to go to the city.\n\n    There is plenty of things we do not need. Like phones, computers, tvs, books, more than bare variety of food and drinks. More than couple of cubic meters of living space. Choosing what clothes or footwear to wear... All things we could do without...\n\n    This is entirely incorrect. The small village I live in, in Scotland? The really crappy and unreliable public transport? Yep. I need a car if I want to get to the Reasonably Priced Supermarkets and transport the weekly shopping back home conveniently, for example.<p>Or if I need to travel to Place of Work&#x2F;customer sites.<p>And then there&#x27;s the long trips around the country when I want to embark on them.<p>So please. Don&#x27;t tell me I don&#x27;t need a car. Reality, practicality, beats ideology any day.\n\n      Who&#x27;s making you live there?\n\nI dont want a car free city, buti desperately want a car de-emphasized city where for most trips the car is an option but its not the beat option vs walking&#x2F;biking&#x2F;transit with this idelly achieved by making those other methods of trnsit dramatically better not by making cars dramatically worse. Kind of like what they have done in the netherlands\n\n  This describes Chicago.\n\n    More like it describes Amsterdam. Chicago is not ideal for many other reasons (taxes, useless government, crime, terrible weather for substantial parts of the year)\n\n&gt; In the US, between 50 and 60 percent of the downtowns of many cities are dedicated to parking alone.<p>This is the part I find the craziest about American cities. You are using some of the most valuable parcels of real estate in your country as parking lots!<p>Part of the reason seems to be that you guys have too much land anyway, so those parcels aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> valuable. Because if they really were prime real estate, somebody would have discovered that it&#x27;s more profitable to move the parking underground and build (apartments|condos|shops|offices) above.<p>If you insist on wasting land on above-ground parking lots, at least put some solar panels or something similarly useful on top.\n\nPeople will obvious hate the idea of “car-free cities”. Why would you push for the most extremist outcome that doesn’t exist anywhere?<p>Advocate for more realistic goals like less car dependence or pedestrian friendly cities.\n\nThis whole idea is fucking terrifying. Normalizing not having cars i.e. making people dependent on the government from birth. If you didn&#x27;t understand what Americans were complaining about with gun laws you will soon.\n\n  Aren&#x27;t you missing a &quot;&#x2F;s&quot;? I hope you are.\n\n  Are you a troll?<p>Nothing better than a city without car, it&#x27;s exactly the reverse: we have pure freedom (and health)\n\n    A new government comes in and limits your ability to use it. What now? Car-free cities seem nice until they&#x27;re used as leverage. No cars means massive power for a tiny number of people.<p>Not everyone is a troll when they disagree with you.\n\n      Who exactly do you think maintains the roads that cars need to run on? Or are you bombing around your carmaxxing city in a lifted 4Runner all day just in case you gotta Go Off-Road Because The Government Closed The Roads?<p>The whole concept is silly on its face.\n\n      A government can always take away your driver&#x27;s license. In practice this happens far, far more often than restricting use of public transport.\n\n    true - you feel very free when everything is accessible on foot. Healthier, more centered, less like a bag of potatoes. It&#x27;s having options, agency. You can live in a car-free city, and still have a car for the stuff you see in the car commercials, just not required for the day2day.<p>It&#x27;s counter-intuitive, and I miss it.\n\n  &gt; making people dependent on the government from birth.<p>Roads are also mostly build by the Government.<p>A lot of people around the world are born in government build&#x2F;run hospitals.\n\n  Weird take. Do all, busses and train systems have to be government owned? And who builds and pays for those roads the cars travel on?\n\n  Err you&#x27;re still dependent on government in the case of vehicles, if you use roads and freeways and.. everything related to traffic.\n\n  Yes, because we&#x27;re (hospitals, 911) not (schools) dependent (roads) on (water) each (trash service) other (fire and police services) other (airports) to (finance) start (research) with.<p>We live in a complex modern world with a lot of dependencies and moving parts.\n\n  Exactly. If you&#x27;re skeptical of gun ownership, go to England and start voicing controversial opinions, or to Australia during a viral pandemic, and see how quickly you realize that &quot;any old fool could be armed&quot; is unbelievably important to ensure everyone keeps their basic ordinary human rights.<p>If you think &quot;no cars&quot; is a good idea, live under a government that takes away your right to public transport. It may not happen right now where you live, but if they need leverage against you, they could use that, and there would be nothing you could do.\n\n  You are already dependent on the government from birth. It is the government that has a monopoly on violence and they are the enforcers of private property.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think I follow, can you elaborate?<p>* Car users are quite dependent on the government for transportation, e.g. the many billions (in the US) of public dollars spent on roads each year. Hard to get around without them!<p>* Even if we hand-wave that away and assume car users aren&#x27;t dependent on the government for transportation, surely _everyone_ is dependent for other reasons like enjoying public goods (national defense, clean air and water, rule of law), access to the social safety net, etc.?\n\n  &gt; Normalizing not having cars i.e. making people dependent on the government from birth.<p>IMHO relying on cars makes us more dependent on the government, overall, because then we depend on road maintenance, fuel supply, fuel subsidies, raw materials and transport for auto parts, et cetera. The government is a critical actor in ensuring all of this.\n\nMost cities in my country are car-free optional. I have multiple bus routes literally in front of my house. I could own a place downtown and go without a car, which im considering.<p>The cities which mandate to be car-free are doing so out of obligation. Mainly due to civil engineering decisions from 500 years ago which have screwed them over. They basically want to go back to horses.<p>So in reality, people hate the idea of car-free cities and choose thusly. There is no &#x27;until they live in one&#x27;.\n\nMy biggest point on car free cities is that it is supported fervently by the people who would gain massive amounts of power over others if nobody had a car. If you&#x27;re dependent on public transport, it can be taken away from you as leverage.\n\n  Well if your dependent on oil to make your car run, the people who have the power to block oil distribution have a huge leverage.<p>I don&#x27;t get your argument, we have a huge dependency on the oil distribution infrastructure. A switch in transportation system is a switch in the type of infrastructure, not a freedom vs control thing.\n\n    The difference is incentives. The oil company wants my money whereas public transit is ran on hope and well wishes. Winds shift and policy can change at any time\n\n      Well not on hope and well wishes, more on planning and political will. As the oil, If your gas station is filled it&#x27;s not only a thanks you the money you give the oil company but a large infrastructure work and political and geopolitical framework that make it happen.\n\n  As leverage for what? If everyone is using the public transport, wouldn’t “taking it away”, if that were even possible, be a massive self-own for the local and state economy? Also, what about countries using this method with overwhelming success?\n\n    The union for the door opener in the middle and glorified AEB at the front of the train has the entire city by the balls<p>See: London tube strikes and NYC subway drivers blocking one person train operation contractually\n\n  Ha what a joke. The biggest lockin is the financial burden of owning a compulsory car. Costs are transferred onto your household. It continues to keep workers poor. When you can bike you don’t need to earn the cost of maintaining a car if you don’t want to. No-one says you can’t buy a car or a jet pack, it’s the car dominance that is in question.\n\n  AFAIK many car free cities depend also on bikes. What do you mean by taking away public transport? Because a car can be taken away, the access to roads can be taken away, there are traffic jams and in case of a city wide emergency - when everyone has a car, no one has.\n\n  &gt; it can be taken away<p>Just like any other good.  The best you can do is vote for those who give, and not vote for those who take it away.\n\n  &quot;If you&#x27;re dependent on public transport, it can be taken away from you as leverage.&quot;<p>I have always lived in Czech cities with extensive public transport and I have never heard of this kind of punishment, ever. Neither against communities, nor against people.<p>Of all the risks, this is probably the most theoretical one.<p>On the other hand, suspending a driving licence is pretty straightforward and it happens daily, CZ or US. And yes, sometimes it is done for leverage in situations that have nothing to do with road safety. For example, in some jurisdictions, if you don&#x27;t pay child support, they will suspend your driving licence as a punishment &#x2F; motivation.\n\n    Its common in third world country where I lived as  retaliation if voting went to non-establishment candidate. It would work for many social amenities like police station, dispensary, bus route and so on.\n\n      Wow, so a mayor can say &quot;from now on, neighbourhood X will have no bus&#x2F;tram&quot;, and the apparatus will comply?<p>That&#x27;s really bad.<p>Technically, I suspect that mayor of Prague <i>could</i> do the same, but the press would eat him alive and his own party colleagues would probably turn on him because of the resulting bad publicity.\n\nHaving a car free <i>city center</i> sounds like a good idea. It&#x27;s not a car free city though (that sounds horrible, not to mention impossible). A city needs less dense areas and at some point outside the city center density will be low enough to a) not have public transit at the required frequency and b) be home for the type of places you need a car for (Lumberyard, car wash, ...).\n\nThe funny thing that&#x27;s been happening in the UK about Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) is that there&#x27;s been lots of press about them being unpopular, driven to a large extent by the current Conservative government who seem to be trying to play to their base. And the threats against people who support them mentioned in the article are real. But rather embarassingly for the government, when they did some proper research it turned out that a large majority of people want them, and they don&#x27;t have nearly as many negative side effects as claimed once they&#x27;ve bedded in: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;2024&#x2F;mar&#x2F;08&#x2F;low-traffic-neighbourhoods-generally-popular-report-ordered-by-sunak-finds\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;2024&#x2F;mar&#x2F;08&#x2F;low-traffic-...</a>\n\n  The fines for going down the wrong street without a permit were used by the local councils as a new revenue source.\n\nItaly strikes the right balance by having car-free zones for pedestrian areas.  Other cities could really use this approach.  In Times Square in New York, you have a major road running right through the main pedestrian area, leading to a bit of conflict.  And it&#x27;s usually Ubers and other vehicles who could&#x27;ve easily gone a different way.\n\nI live in a nice little city in the Netherlands, Leiden. I am from the U.K.<p>I cannot believe people would want to live any other way than with accessible bike paths and walkable streets. It is mad.\n\nYou either think mandatory car-free cities are a terrifyingly dystopian idea, or you&#x27;ve never experienced human culture outside of dense urban areas.\n\n  This is weirdly projective and I&#x27;m happy to be an obvious counterpoint to it. I grew up in the middle of nowhere. I moved to a city and didn&#x27;t have a car for years. It was great and I wish I could&#x27;ve sustained it.<p>As-is, I have a car (the absolute cheapest thing I could find, for Home Depot runs during home renovation) but drive it once a week and commute to the city center by public transit because New England lets you do that, even if it&#x27;s not as convenient as I&#x27;d like.\n\nThese (American) articles on urbanism and what not always make it seems much more insane than it is.<p>I live in the Netherlands, a country usually lauded for it&#x27;s bicycles and public transport and what not.<p>And let me tell you: We still drive cars. All the time.<p>Even in Amsterdam, our biggest city, 4&#x2F;10 families still owns their personal car. In the Netherlands as a whole it&#x27;s 9.5&#x2F;10 or so.<p>It&#x27;s about THE MIX of options.\n\n  yeah, it needs to be reframed as &quot;car-dependency&quot; because that&#x27;s the major issue, everyone is <i>forced</i> into driving because there&#x27;s no viable options.<p>If every move you make requires a car, the traffic situation is always deleterious.\n\n  It’s important to emphasise that the additional transport options made driving BETTER.\n\n  &gt; These (American) articles on urbanism and what not always make it seems much more insane than it is.<p>Wholeheartedly agree, and what is also funny that usually it is described from POV of citizen living in: tier one city center with mild weather whole year round and relatively flat topography&#x2F;terrain - and at the same time it&#x27;s written in a way that suggest that it&#x27;s THE SOLUTION absolutely applicable everywhere else.\n\n    The solution applicable almost everywhere with some dozens of thousands of population is multimodal. Public transportation supported by infrastructure for cycling and cars relegated to their place in a multimodal system: inconvenient for shorter&#x2F;regular trips, accessible for when it&#x27;s needed.<p>Stockholm doesn&#x27;t have mild weather all year long, it&#x27;s not flat, and still people will use public transportation or a bike. Oslo is definitely not flat, definitely not mild year round and even there people take public transportation, bike, etc.\n\n      And again, as examples you provide two capital cities of two richest countries in the world - capital cities are rich, can easily afford building public infra and also population density is big enough to make public transportation almost profitable - but not everybody lives in a capital city.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lovetransit.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;most-profitable-public-transportation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lovetransit.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;most-profitable-public-tr...</a>\n\n        Those are just examples of two cities I&#x27;m closely familiar. People also bike everywhere in China, many Chinese cities have decent public transportation (much better than almost any non-big city in the USA).<p>Small cities in the Netherlands are able to afford bus lines, and provide infrastructure for bikes which are much cheaper than roads for autos.<p>Good public transportation is a net contributor to a city, it provides residents with ways to be more economically active without costing them much. You don&#x27;t need underground metro, not even trams in most cases, a simple and reliable bus transit system can provide a lot if it&#x27;s not delayed by traffic.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be rich to have decent and reliable public transportation, Southeast Asia has quite good examples of that.\n\n        Berlin is quite poor and it still has decent public transport and good walkability. Public transport is far from profitable in Berlin. It&#x27;s entirely possible to raise a family without a having a car in Berlin.\n\n    I think you are missing the point. Yes I am currently living in Europe and yes almost every family own a car.The difference is when, how frequently its used and also the fact that you have  alternatives. These article are idealiziling a car-free lifestyle that is definitely not quite ubiquitous but it does exists. Also, your idealized weather and topo do exists in the US, think California (and I would argue the entire west coast) but the infra, urbanism and often the laws do not allowe safe alternatives to cars and this is the core of the problem. Your comment make it like the whole EU has Mediterranean climate or is flat as Amsterdam, which cannot be further from the reality.\n\n  I think it&#x27;s worth emphasizing just how low the bar is in the US for public transportation bike infrastructure, and walkability, even in many of the big cities.\n\n  Where do you get this data from? I&#x27;ve been living in Amsterdam for 5 years now and all of my friends or people that I know of that live somewhat in the city don&#x27;t have a car... because (1) they can&#x27;t afford it and (2) they don&#x27;t need it. Biking infra is so freaking amazing that it makes me want to bike all the time instead of getting the car (even if I had one). Driving around with a car in Amsterdam is just madness. I did it a few times for moving heavy stuff around and it&#x27;s a mess because you&#x27;re redirected across streets making it 5x longer to get to where you have to.<p>I think your experience comes more from people living outside the dutch cities, in more rural areas? Then it makes sense to own a car. It doesn&#x27;t make sense in a densely populated area.<p>But anyway the Netherlands has really figured it out when it comes to public transport. No other place comes close in my experience. People who grew up here perhaps don&#x27;t realize how lucky they area... and how shit it is in other places.\n\n    Per capita car ownership in The Netherlands is comparable to nearby countries:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_and_territories_by_motor_vehicles_per_capita\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_and_territor...</a><p>Not taking a side, I agree with you that trying to use a car in any of the larger Dutch cities would be crazy. But car ownership has sadly been on the rise recently.\n\n    This is likely an age thing. I suspect you&#x27;re without a family? I think what he&#x27;s getting at is that we cycle everywhere, except when we can&#x27;t, which matches my experience.\n\n      You&#x27;re seriously driving around Amsterdam in a car? But why when a bicycle is 10x faster and easier?\n\n        I generally don&#x27;t drive anywhere that&#x27;s under 15Km away, but there are exceptions. Taking the family to certain places just isn&#x27;t feasible by bike sometimes.\n\n    Most people living in Amsterdam are rich, as the average house costs 500k+.<p>A car is probably costing 10k&#x2F;year, so if they can&#x27;t afford it they aren&#x27;t average.<p>For context I&#x27;ve lived here 10 years and very few of my friends have cars, including me. But it&#x27;s totally a lifestyle choice, as it would be worth it on a personal level.\n\n    &gt; Where do you get this data from?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.nl&#x2F;nl-nl&#x2F;maatschappij&#x2F;verkeer-en-vervoer&#x2F;ov-monitor&#x2F;hoe-bereikbaar-is-het-ov&#x2F;afstand-tot-het-station-en-autobezit-per-gemeente-#:~:text=Het%20gemiddelde%20autobezit%20per%20huishouden,1%2C5%20auto&#x27;s%20per%20huishouden\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.nl&#x2F;nl-nl&#x2F;maatschappij&#x2F;verkeer-en-vervoer&#x2F;ov-...</a>.\n\n  Exactly this. Obviously I still need a car, but my day-to-day transport of choice is the bicycle.<p>I will say this though: You people can&#x27;t drive! I&#x27;ve seen more car accidents in my few years here than my entire _life_ in England!\n\n  That&#x27;s still a completely different reality than the US. Many people in my neighborhood have more than 1 vehicle per person. That&#x27;s a far cry from less than half of families having a single car.\n\nImagine that a toxic substance like asphalt would be in every street of the world... oooops! That&#x27;s real!\n\nAs an American who moved to Berlin 15 years ago, I love not needing a car. We like to visit Paris, Amsterdam, London, Florence, and more cities multiple times a year and we never get a car. Between public transportation and my bicycle, I can get just about anywhere I need to and usually faster than in a car.<p>If I need a car for some unusual errand, which is rare like once a year, I use an app to cheaply rent a car of the needed size for a few hours.<p>Recently had to go to the US for a short trip and I had to rent a car. It felt insane how much time I had to spend in my car just to visit people who all live in the same metro area, due to all the sprawl.\n\nAMA, I lived in a car-free city for 10 years.<p>It&#x27;s not free of cars (there&#x27;s plenty of them there), but public transit is good and you can live your life without owning a car. The main requirements: a) you need to be comfortable with living in a small apartment, b) you shouldn&#x27;t have any interests outside of the city c) stick &quot;one day - one errand&quot; rule. YMMV, but I felt essentially locked inside a big city and hated it.\n\nWhen I was in university, I worked on a study that collected people’s preferences for different types of developments. When you asked them what they wanted, they basically said easy driving and parking. When you showed pictures of different types of development (sprawl, transit oriented development, etc), they overwhelmingly picked the car-free option. People don’t know what they want.\n\nI lived without a car for a decade (London &#x2F; other towns in the UK) and then I moved to a place in EU where I need a car but things are pretty close by. I can get a bus but they&#x27;re not frequent enough to replace cars.<p>Overall the better quality of life (food, weather, access to seaside, real estate affordability, lower cost of living in general) weighs WAY more than having to drive a car or not.<p>It&#x27;s a nice to have but not &quot;life-changing&quot;.\nThe important bit is to have the stores you need nearby so you don&#x27;t have to drive 30m to get a coffee and 1h to go shopping. That&#x27;s what wrong with the USA. \nMost of Europe has towns like this: you still need cars, but everything is close by.<p>Pros:<p>- I can go wherever I want\n - I can carry a lot more groceries &#x2F; stuff\n - I don&#x27;t stress about timetables anymore\n - No need to rent a car to do trivial work<p>Cons:<p>- Need to pay for car, insurance, parking\n - Higher risk of accidents\n - Risk of fines (speed limits are ridiculous, same for alchol tolerance)\n\nYup, everyone&#x27;s gotta drive to the supermarket in their 9999999 tonne landtank SUV now.<p>It&#x27;s so bad in London now, traffic is just becoming all SUVs. I&#x27;d love for them to be banned, but consumers want SUVs...so there&#x27;ll never be a ban. There&#x27;s not even that much space inside an SUV either!!<p>Back in NZ we actually used utes and other large vehicles for what they&#x27;re actually meant for.\n\n  Paris just voted to have tripple parking fees for vehicles heavier than 1.6 tons. Maybe this is the way to go.\n\nIt is amazing how bad we are at walkable infrastructure in the US. There are housing developments &lt;.5 miles from a grocery store with no sidewalks in between. Why not at least have a path for bikes?\n\nJust look at Pontevedra in Spain. 90% pedestrianised city and several years with 0 traffic related deaths. Lovely city!\n\nI&#x27;m always amazed how different people are. Living in a high density city made me miserable because there were constantly people around me. On the other hand I love semi-rural low density suburbs (What I can afford) and extreme rural even more. If I saw these policies enacted I would try hard to get out.\n\nThese days I&#x27;m finding myself doing half my trips on a bicycle and half in a car. In my experience one of the biggest barriers to micromobility in America is cultural. Motorists can be aggressive and complacent because their vehicles are big and have airbags, and so long as they aren&#x27;t impaired they won&#x27;t be held accountable for harm they cause with their vehicles. Cyclists and pedestrians can act in a way that is entitled and reckless because they know they probably won&#x27;t be held accountable for their behavior either. Except some of them sometimes forget that the laws of physics are less flexible.<p>A few years ago I was driving my son somewhere, and a cyclist blew through a red light and slammed into the side of my car. Fortunately the only injuries were the ones that the cyclist inflicted on himself through his reckless disregard for the law. Judging how much damage he did to my car, if my son and I had been on our e-bikes instead then I think that guy could have easily killed my kid.<p>Knowing that there are too many cyclists and motorists who behave with complete disregard for the law makes me feel like I really have no choice but to put my child in a big steel cage with airbags and crumple zones if we&#x27;re going to travel anywhere on American roads. And before you ask, this was not in a big city, so public transportation was not a viable option for us that day.<p>My personal experience seeing peoples&#x27; general behavior and attitudes on roads in both Japan and Amsterdam makes me wish we could find a way to adopt some of that culture.\n\n  People will always be entitled, but there needn&#x27;t be dangerous contact. As a lifelong cyclist, the main problem (in my opinion) America faces here is the fact that we have <i>exclusively</i> car-first infrastructure.<p>The American stop sign, to me, is the symbol of how entrenched everything is here. Stop signs make zero sense for any mode of transportation <i>except for cars</i>. A physical, traffic-calming rotary at every intersection, in every neighborhood would be much more sensible, and reduce conflicts.<p>We could add collapsing bollards to create cycling corridors that cyclists actually want to be on, instead of the insane decision we&#x27;ve made to mix our cyclists and vehicles with a single line of paint on some of the busiest roads in the cities we live in.<p>Where all of this runs into a problem is with emergency response vehicles. Because our fire&#x2F;EMS infrastructure is path-dependent with our transportation infrastructure, they tend to bitch and moan any time physical barriers are put up, or pedestrian malls are introduced. The system is the way it is, and if it changes, they believe it will cause them problems. The Fire Department in SF has been one of the biggest roadblocks to creating safe parallel corridors for cycling infrastructure, blocking bollards, neutering rotaries to the point if ineffectiveness, blocking traffic calming features unless they allow for high-speed fire&#x2F;EMS vehicles, thus defeating the purpose.<p>If anyone wanted to make a long lasting impact on American society, this is the problem I would focus on solving. I think building emergency response vehicles (specifically fire, and ambulances) that can interact with a traffic calming feature that is impassible to normal vehicles but passable to bicycles and pedestrians (say via high clearance) would do more for saving lives, reducing emissions, and stemming the tide of the American development pattern across the world than almost anything else.\n\n    Why doesn&#x27;t Japan need parallel corridors, blocking bollards, and so forth to keep their cyclist casualties down?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;vision-zero-cities-journal&#x2F;the-unique-safety-of-cycling-in-tokyo-b3b8eded727e\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;vision-zero-cities-journal&#x2F;the-unique-saf...</a><p>Key point from the article: &quot;Public safety is facilitated by a culture of compliance.&quot;\n\nWhile this definitely does not compare this experience, it did show this young person the utility; in the early 70s when Disney World opened, we used the trams in Fort Wilderness to get around for a week; shopping and back and forth to the camp store, going to the activities in the day, evening and at night. Just running around. Did this all with and without parents, and I think they were possibly electric at that time as they stopped right outside your campsite at the corner and must have been very quiet, or maybe diesel, just don&#x27;t recall. We simply learned the schedule, hopped on and then off,  and simply had a great time. Like many things Disney, I thought I was looking at the future and was pleased.\n\nThe ones that have to actually commute, not so much.\n\nI know they&#x27;ve spent millions on car reduction schemes, but it&#x27;s mostly wasted money. If you want people to see cycling as a viable alternative, then make it a viable alternative.<p>I used to live in London, and now live somewhere where I cycle anywhere that&#x27;s under 15Km — because it&#x27;s viable (and more enjoyable!). London is not that, and they haven&#x27;t done anything to make it that.<p>Painting bits of the road doesn&#x27;t magically give you a &quot;cycle network&quot;.\n\nWell, might be unpopular but... I hate cities, no matter with cars or not: I hate cities because I love efficiency AND evolution.<p>- creating large buildings, so large aqueducts, that normally have to grab water far away, altering MUCH the natural water distribution cycle for a big radius around cities, so large sewers who push much concentrated pollution (recall: without oxygen we die, with too much oxygen we die as well, in nature &quot;a poison&quot; is something at a poisonous concentration) is not a good thing, yes we spare land, but we consume MUCH more, not much less contrary contrary to common belief, which I suspect is the result of interested propaganda;<p>- large cities, large buildings are things we can&#x27;t quickly evolve. There are too much people, to physically near interests to being able to agree and realize something new, and in a changing world, so a changing society being able to evolve is needed;<p>- large cities often are somewhere because in a far past there was much reasons to have them there, sometimes some reasons are still valid (like local climate, water availability, accessibility, ...) but sometimes are not there anymore and other reasons NOT to be there are much more relevant. Again moving light homes&#x2F;sheds&#x2F;compact warehouses it&#x27;s far easier than moving large complex. Jakarta is the extreme example and the new Nusantara is a good demonstration of the insustainability, similarly &quot;most efficient modern cities&quot; like modern Fordlandia, like Telosa, Arkadag, Prospera, Innopolis, ... are good example of the same: cities are giant factories made to transform citizens into workers, that do not own the factory, do not decide their jobs, that have nothing and mush follow the stream to been able to earn enough to get services, and services costly enough to ensure they keep working at maximum, getting essentially nothing in the end. Trapped in a process they can&#x27;t really control or direct.<p>Modern cities can ONLY works with mass transit, private cars in such dense are are an unsustainable nightmare, but modern cities are unsustainable and a nightmare themselves. Like money in modern world is a tool to extract values from most, in very few private cleptocratic hands, cities are a tool to force people working and conform to the few who organize them. I like freedom, so I do not like cities.<p>If you try to REALLY be curious in the scientific sense, you&#x27;ll end up simulating costs, raw materials and so on of a fictional city vs a fictional spread area, NOT like USA suburbs but like European Rivieras (meaning work and residential areas intermixed) and the result is that the spread version (not too much spread, not too dense) is CHEAPER and obviously can evolve better. Oh, yes, a multi-storey NEW building is more efficient than a set of NEW homes. Today. In 50 years you can&#x27;t upgrade the multi-storey now not so new building while you can upgrade&#x2F;re-create from the ground small homes. So in the long run the initial energy efficiency drop. The bigger structure demand much more raw materials than many little&#x2F;lighter ones as well. Similarly trains are more efficient than roads, but demand much more to be build and kept up. Going by air demand a lot more energy to go from A to B, but do not demand an road&#x2F;rail infra between A and B and so on. In the past we have experimented mainframes, than we understand clusters are better, more resilient, easy to evolve and so on. Sure, they are harder to be made and used efficiently, but that&#x27;s is. Try, for sure and think about dense city life vs sparse life. Think about how much you spend depending where you live, think about how much packaging you use just to eat&#x2F;drink downtown vs at your own home, how efficient a small food domestic stock can be respect of buy grocery every days and so on. I&#x27;ve done the math and tried myself having left a big city for mountings (of course, in a not that remote area).\n\nThis is insulting my 30 years life in developing countries.

I assume most EU countries have a requirement that new building permits need to come with precisely measured outlines, this could help increase their precision and&#x2F;or make the measurements cheaper.\n\n  Sometimes we need to give awesome tools to creative people and see what they come up with, even when we don&#x27;t understand the implications ourselves.<p>I think millimeter accurate GPS is one of those tools. It has the power to enable so many things. Things we cannot imagine without using the tool itself.<p>40 cm vs 1 mm is the difference between landing a quadcopter smoothly or crashing it into the ground.<p>20 cm vs 1 mm is the difference between a robot navigating through a door or crashing into the wall.<p>20 cm vs 1 mm is the difference between mowing the lawn or cutting through your flower bed.<p>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;ll be getting millimeter accurate GPS anytime soon. The Genesis satellite might be a prerequisite though.\n\n    The government artificially limits civilian gps resolution. Millimeter gps would be a boon for hellfire R9X type explosive free ballistics.\n\n      This hasn’t been true for 24 years. Selective Availability was discontinued in May of 2000.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Global_Positioning_System\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Global_Positioning_System</a>\n\n        Why reveal your entire hand?\n\n  Sea level rise.\n\n  To make another one to verify if 42 is indeed the answer to everything. ;)\n\n  A personal reason: I&#x27;m building a global simulator for shadows [1]. I started with SRTM based elevation data which allowed me to cast mountain shadows. I&#x27;m now offering some LiDAR data which also includes buildings, structures and trees (~50cm resolution). People use my website for sun mapping their gardens, real estate, farms, events, photography, academic research, solar systems. It would be nice to amp up that resolution by another factor.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shademap.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shademap.app</a><p>Edit: after reading the article it seems less about surveying the Earth&#x27;s surface and more about accurate triangulation like GPS :(\n\n  &gt; Why?<p>So somebody can tell if the neighbour’s fence infringes on their property line.\n\nWill this be available in consumer products like phones?<p>What could one do with such accuracy, and how to interpret this when sensor is larger than precision?\n\nAs ever, there&#x27;s an XKCD for that:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2170&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2170&#x2F;</a>\n\nI wonder if you could make a completely offline location service by correlating the results of a local 3d scan of the ground to the global model?<p>Cruise missiles already do something similar. How big is a mm scale model of the globe?<p>It would almost completely negate the need for easily jammed and expensive to maintain gps satellites.\n\n  I imagine the earth isn&#x27;t particularly static on the mm level.\n\n    True - buildings and exposed rock probably stay still, leaf litter and trees definitely don’t. You’d need to find enough of a stable reference to run your correlation - probably more useful in an urban area.\n\n      On a millimeter scale I expect weather&#x2F;seasons will cause movement of the ground as the soil swells with water from rain, or water freezing.\n\n      Taller buildings can flex up to a few feet in each direction actually!\n\n    I believe tectonic plates generally move about 15mm a year - which is pretty fast when you think about it!\n\n      <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plate_tectonics#Key_principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plate_tectonics#Key_principles</a><p>&gt; <i>Plate motions range from 10 to 40 mm&#x2F;year at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160 mm&#x2F;year for the Nazca Plate (about as fast as hair grows)</i>\n\n  Apparently the US Navy has this kind of system for positioning of submarines to correct inertial navigation system errors. Allegedly they also have very good maps of large swaths of the ocean floor to make it useful.\n\n    Very accurately measuring gravitational anomalies is important for this too.\n\n      Plate tectonics would&#x27;ve been accepted much earlier if the seafloor magnetism maps hadn&#x27;t been classified.\n\n  &gt; I wonder if you could make a completely offline location service by correlating the results of a local 3d scan of the ground to the global model?<p>It&#x27;s possible, see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39507267\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39507267</a>\n\nthere was a geologist saying more or less: &quot;volcaninc eruptions in the winter are inconvenient, the snow on the ground doesn&#x27;t allow fine measurement of the surface deformation, wind and waves swamp the seismometers, and clouds tend to obscure satellite photos&quot;. Long story short, it will be a very nice fair weather map.\n\nBaffling. The earth isn’t a perfectly smooth solid sphere that never deforms. It is a dynamic object being shaped by all sorts of forces. How do they guarantee 0.1mm error over a year. It must be limited to a small number of high value targets given the techniques used on the article, but still unclear.  Just seems wildly complicated to get right.\n\n  Yep. The ground itself moves with the tides.. so it&#x27;s never static.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earth_tide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earth_tide</a>\n\nThis does not really seem to be about measuring the earth; it&#x27;s about more accurate GNSS. Then if you have very accurate GNSS you can also get more accuracy in the ITRF.<p>Also to add context: there are many hurdles to hitting a 1mm accuracy for a satellite based positioning service.<p>One can already achieve accuracy of a few cm, but it&#x27;s a painful process. You basically place a receiver somewhere, keep it there for a few hours, then download the pseudoranges, and post-process on a computer. In post-processing you correct for ionosphere error and satellite ephemerides (the satellites broadcast their rough location and clock readings, but you can download much more accurate data for these later to get a much better idea of where the satellites were). You need to do post-processing after some delay, because ionosphere readings and satellite ephemerides are not available immediately (the accuracy increases as you wait longer!).<p>You can also extend this with what&#x27;s called &quot;Precise Point Positioning&quot; (PPP) using one ground-station that broadcasts an extra signal to moving receivers nearby, so there are ways to get higher accuracy on moving receivers, but it&#x27;s still painful.<p>So probably 1mm will come soon to fixed ITRF monitoring stations (basically the ITRF tries to track tectonic movements, etc as those are at the mm level), but it&#x27;s very far from coming to drones or cars.\n\n  PPP doesn’t utilise ground stations, and to achieve cm accuracy, you need to utilise phase information and solve the ambiguity problem<p>1mm accuracy almost certainly relies on ionosphere and troposphere observations at high temporal and spatial frequency. The process of post processing is essentially correct, but there is a point at which the ionosphere solution won’t get better without an increase in density of observations\n\n    Ah thanks for the corrections, I guess RTK is what uses the ground station&#x2F;mobile receiver concept.\n\n  Could you track satellites by imaging them from earth? Some are visible to the naked eye at night. It seems like that would be instant and very accurate data.\n\n    I believe that&#x27;s how satellites are tracked at all? Rather than use visible light, though, tracking stations most certainly use radar, and probably highly directional antennas.\n\n      I think they are actually measured with lasers, IIRC. Did a lot of research about GNSS when setting up an RTK base station, and used PPP to get the initial location.\n\nI wonder how this experiment will take into account the expansion and contraction of the Earth - certainly at millimeter scales, this will be a factor?  Is it not also true that some forms of weather systems can impact topography at those scales?\n\nThey will discover that the earth isn&#x27;t constant in size at that scale.\n\nAren&#x27;t there privacy implications for this? Can I opt to have my property blurred like I can for Google Street View?\n\n  Doesn’t your local government have precise records of property boundaries and building dimensions and locations already?\n\n  I don&#x27;t think they are capturing imagery across the globe.<p>This effort is more about devices (sensors on the ground) having more accurate positioning information.\n\nWith the gravity of the moon, and tectonics.  It will be interesting to see what insights this will reveal.  That all gets down to how frequently they sample areas.  If anything, the gravitational impact on the planet beyond waves would be useful for augmenting seismic measurements&#x2F;events.\n\nIIRC... the European geographic grid is tied to the continental plate, and there are sampling points around the perimeter of the continent whose positions are updated with cm-scale accuracy at least yearly.\n\nMy guess is that we will get final orbits and clocks to do PPP more quickly.<p>Today it&#x27;s about a week.<p>I&#x27;m guessing we will get this at the speed we currently get rapid.<p>All guesswork... As a gnss guy who doesn&#x27;t have knowledge of this project\n\nIs the LEO-PNT part of this funding really going to make indoor localization a reality?  That seems like a big deal."

      "conversation_text": "As someone who learned most of my initial coding abilities through R and RStudio in a data science context, and since moved on to more “standard” languages and IDEs, I’ve yet to find anything that comes close to the flexibility and integration of RStudio for hacking together data analytics.<p>VS Code&#x2F;Python has made some major improvements in the past couple years but it’s still very clunky compared to the ease of running R code line by line without having to start up a debug instance. And now with copilot the most frustrating parts of R (such as remembering all the Tidyverse syntax) have been abstracted away.\n\n  My partner does a lot of biostats in RStudio and I really think it breds terrible habits.  Instead of categorizing code by files, everything is shoved into massive files.  Instead of running a file top-to-bottom, code is run out-of-order which makes the code organization and flow of a program a complete disaster.<p>There is something to be said about running and processing large CSVs and keeping that in memory while running other parts of the program as well as having clickable access to all the dataframes loaded into memory.\n\n    There&#x27;s nothing about RStudio that encourages big single files or writing huge unstructured scripts. RStudio is a pretty good IDE, and R is a highly expressive functional-first [0] language. R was heavily influenced by Scheme, and has its own powerful metaprogramming [1] system - which is used to great effect in Tidyverse[2] libraries to make APIs that are nicer and convenient than anything reasonably practical in Python.<p>The problem with a lot of end-user R code is that it is written by statisticians, not programmers. They&#x27;d write the same garbage and huge scripts in Python (trust me, I know).<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adv-r.had.co.nz&#x2F;Functional-programming.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adv-r.had.co.nz&#x2F;Functional-programming.html</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adv-r.hadley.nz&#x2F;metaprogramming.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adv-r.hadley.nz&#x2F;metaprogramming.html</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidyverse.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidyverse.org&#x2F;</a>\n\n      I agree that RStudio isn&#x27;t too awful, but the packaging management and reproducibility situation in R is dire, even compared to Python.<p>I have to deal with getting code from data scientists into production, and simply getting it to run outside of their mutant local environment can take days. Things are starting to get a bit better with packrat initially and now renv&#x2F;pak&#x2F;rig and the like, but most DS haven&#x27;t heard of them, and major breakages between minor library versions are still commonplace, as are undocumeted system library dependencies. Then there is the whole stringsAsFactors nightmare, thankfully slowly on its way out but still around causing occasional catastrophic breakage.<p>There are lots of nice things about R, but it makes it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\n        Yeah, the package management situation is a big weak spot. There are some issues with renv, but it is usable. It definitely helps to keep a lid on the number of dependencies, and for God&#x27;s sake never pull anything in from Bioconductor. IMO, new code should always prefer Tidyverse libs for basic stuff, and avoid relying on the ancient and warty standard library.<p>All that said, I still greatly prefer it over Python for DS work.\n\n        &gt;I agree that RStudio isn&#x27;t too awful, but the packaging management and reproducibility situation in R is dire, even compared to Python.<p>I&#x27;ve had exactly the opposite experience. For R, I download R and install it, and download Rstudio and install it. Then when I need a new package I just install.packages(&quot;coolnewpackage&quot;) and it just works (TM). Occasionally I get info messages about packages being built in newer versions of R, and once a year or so I eventually get around to looking up how to use the updateR() function, but in five years of doing biostats in R I can&#x27;t remember a single time I had a dependency issue.<p>Python, on the other hand, is a nightmare. Conda makes life a lot easier, but it is not easy to learn if you are not a software engineer (remember, R was made not just <i>by</i> statisticians, but <i>for</i> them as well). For many projects, my Python flow was something like...<p>Try creating a new conda env with the packages I think I need. Try starting the project, oops I don&#x27;t have spyder-kernels installed. Oh, and my environment isn&#x27;t compatible with it. How about just running it in VScode? Well now I don&#x27;t have my variable explorer. How about Jupyter? How do I get Jupyter to find my conda env again? Oh wait I need this other library it&#x27;s only on conda-forge, and then the conda environment solver fails. I guess I&#x27;ll start from scratch with a new conda env, and maybe after several trial-and-error sessions of carefully composing the correct &quot;conda create -n ...&quot; incantation in a text editor before copy-pasting them to the command line, I <i>might</i> get the environment I need up and running, after conda finishes its 10-minute compatibility search and downloads 80 GB of python libraries.<p>And using conda is the <i>easy</i> way of doing it! Don&#x27;t even get me started on pip and venv...\n\n          Great summary of the situation. If you&#x27;ve ever been in the position of trying to explain to a bunch of R users why Python packaging is so much harder to deal with, you know the struggle. R&#x2F;RStudio really makes it incredibly easy to get up and going for non-developers in a way that&#x27;s probably hard to appreciate for many people on HN who are SWEs by trade.\n\n          I have never needed anything more than pip in 8 years of development, and have always run into issues with r packages (every new version of r seems to break 30% of existing tidyverse packages)\n\n            Do you do much DS&#x2F;ML in Python? I definitely agree that pip is totally fine otherwise.<p>At work, I&#x27;ve been giving out about pip to one of our DEs for a while, and when he needed to upgrade a bunch of DS packages he finally started coming around to my opinion.\n\n          With R on Windows, you get some binary dependencies, but on Linux you need the system libraries for any package that uses an external library. R uses the HTTP headers to determine which binary package to send you and no roll-your-own package system for virus scanning and the like supports either the Conda contrib patterns nor the R HTTP code binary scheme. I think Conda used to be kind of cool, but I have the same problems, and its position was always to make a ton of assumptions about what you want to do. R is like that... Sensible and automatic defaults that you can&#x27;t find or aren&#x27;t told about.\n\n          Your own experience seems to disprove the claim that conda makes running analytical&#x2F;numerical code easier in Python. Simple venv and pip really is the simpler choice.\n\n      I think a lot of the problem is that R does everything it can to prevent people from writing modular code.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have modules or namespaces, and the current fashion is for packages to use non-standard evaluation which adds friction to user&#x27;s writing their own functions.\n\n        R does have namespaces. Take a look at the NAMESPACE file found at the root of every R package, which defines the symbols and methods exported by the package.<p>Note for many R packages, the NAMESPACE file is autogenerated from roxygen docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cran.r-project.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;packages&#x2F;roxygen2&#x2F;vignettes&#x2F;namespace.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cran.r-project.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;packages&#x2F;roxygen2&#x2F;vignettes&#x2F;n...</a>\n\n          &gt; which defines the symbols and methods exported by the package<p>Which are all dumped into the one single global namespace regardless if you want everything or not.<p>I can&#x27;t remember the exact number, but tidyverse package imports literally <i>thousands</i> of things into your global namespace on package load, coupled with any other dependencies and you have a hell of a time figuring out where any function or constant came from.\n\n            Calling library() is kind of an antipattern in production R code. You can either call namespaced functions (like say dplyr::mutate()), or use roxygen.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roxygen2.r-lib.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;namespace.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roxygen2.r-lib.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;namespace.html</a>\n\n              Agreed but the GP isn&#x27;t wrong. It&#x27;s much much nicer to import a library with an alias in Python.\n\n      &gt;  it is written by statisticians, not programmers. They&#x27;d write the same garbage in Python<p>I guess I should take offense as a statistician. But its a fairly common complaint. The reality is, most of us statisticians are trying to compute a result. Like once. Or sometimes twice. For a paper. Or a task. If someone comes to me with a time series and asks me to test it for stationarity, or find the p lags to make it MA(p) stationary, they aren&#x27;t asking me to write a program. The goal is not reproducibility. The goal is a fast answer. I&#x27;ve used R at trading desks &amp; financial institutions - the goal has seldom been &quot;run the same program again, but with this new input&quot;. If that was the case, I would write a function &amp; stick it in a nice library with documentation. But these aren&#x27;t tech firms. We aren&#x27;t shipping software. The goal is to compute something fast so you can get on with life &amp; make the trade, or draft the next paragraph in your paper, or... Like if they give me a set of bespoke mortgages with some hairy constraints &amp; ask me to compute the value at risk, there is not much point in building some VaR function. Because its a once in a while thing. Next time it will involve a different set of args &amp; they&#x27;d be different constraints &amp; so forth. So just write some 10 line script &amp; get the number &amp; move on. Yeah, sometimes I would stash the script in some repo &amp; write a 1-line comment on how it works - but its kinda pointless, it doesn&#x27;t get much play&#x2F;reuse. We aren&#x27;t programmers in that sense, we are just trying to solve problems.<p>My kid knocked on my office door yesterday. He&#x27;s in some AoPs course where they use generating functions to count stuff. So he had a problem about the number of ways to add three odd numbers to make 1001. He had worked out the algebra &amp; gotten some number, but before he hits Submit, he wants to doublecheck with me because wrong answers have a penalty. Now, I don&#x27;t have the time to go back to school and learn what is a generating function. And I don&#x27;t want to write lots of for loops &amp; if statements &amp; fight with syntax errors &amp; so forth. So my 1-liner in R<p>dim(subset(expand.grid(a=seq(1,1001,2), b=seq(1,1001,2), c=seq(1,1001,2)), a+b+c==1001))<p>tells me there are 125250 ways. He says he got the same number with generating functions. Boom done! So that&#x27;s what R is for. Quick &amp; easy.\n\n        I have been an R &quot;user&quot; for a while now, after reading your single line approach to the problem I am reminded of the saying which goes something like this &quot;An idiot admires complexity, A genius admires simplicity!&quot;. Perfectly splendid!\n\n    This is the defacto standard way of operating it I understand, which is mostly just hacking at stuff in small chunks until it sort of works and leaving comments throughout it with &quot;run this bit on Tuesdays only&quot;.<p>I recently had to inherit someone&#x27;s R stuff and I had to learn R and fix it all. It now runs from a makefile repeatably.<p>Anyway it could be worse. It could be Minitab.\n\n    &gt; Instead of categorizing code by files, everything is shoved into massive files.<p>That&#x27;s not really RStudio&#x27;s fault. It is just how many people use R and were taught.<p>&gt; code is run out-of-order which makes the code organization and flow of a program a complete disaster.<p>In my experience, with R Markdown, this is untrue. I see Jupyter Notebooks with cells run out of order much more often.\n\n      I have done a lot in R Markdown, and the project I&#x27;m currently working on has me mostly working in Databricks notebooks (which are very similar to Jupyter notebooks).  My execution gets out of order a lot more often in Databricks.\n\n    &gt; Instead of running a file top-to-bottom, code is run out-of-order which makes the code organization and flow of a program a complete disaster.<p>That&#x27;s more a REPL issue than specific to a particular language. It&#x27;s the tradeoff you make. I write my R programs in Geany and then run the whole thing using Rscript. That gives me a clean environment on every run.\n\n  Emacs + ESS? Way more flexible. Maybe less integration because many of the big R package devs work for Posit. RStudio has a lot of superfluous junk in the UI I just don&#x27;t need or care about.\n\n    I&#x27;ve used ESS for the past few years and recently tried using RStudio when I&#x27;m on Windows. For my purposes, which is just a little industrial statistics on the side, they are remarkably similar. I feel right at home in either!\n\n  &gt; I’ve yet to find anything that comes close to the flexibility and integration of RStudio for hacking together data analytics.<p>Is there a good demo or video you can point to that shows this? I have no experience with R, RStudio, or data science, but you&#x27;ve piqued my interest.\n\n    Any of David Robinson&#x27;s (or anyone else&#x27;s) Tidy Tuesday videos.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@safe4democracy&#x2F;featured\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@safe4democracy&#x2F;featured</a>\n\n  jupyter\n\n  This works out of the box in VSCode?<p>Just open a .py file, then select the snippet of code you want to run and cmd+enter<p>It will open a new REPL for you (using your selected interpreter) the first time, and after that all commands are run in that same one.\n\n    RStudio is just way better at choosing what code to send (if you only send the line the cursor rests on you’re gonna have a bad time. VSCode is a bit better than that but not great. Also, where does your plots get drawn when you use this? RStudio just works in this regards)\n\n  I agree - I teach statistics at a University and there is really no alternative to Rstudio for working with R. This is especially true considering that the vast majority of folk using R (in my field) have no prior programming experience. Downloading R, Vscode, downloading some R plugin, getting them to talk to each other, and only then starting to learn R - isn&#x27;t very straightforward. It&#x27;s also remarkably consistent on different operating systems - something to consider when half the students are on windows, half on macos...\n\n    RStudio Server on a Digital Ocean instance made my life a lot easier. Students fire up a browser, log in, and they&#x27;re using R with all the packages. It was horrible when students ran R on their own machines back in the old days. Most of the questions I got were tech support rather than related to the material. And these days it has good Python support too.\n\n  Jupiter (ipynb) notebooks in vs code.\n\n  If you work with Python, Spyder comes really, really close and is way better than jupyter\n\n  It looks like, as far as I can tell, VS Code doesn&#x27;t support the interactive window for working in R, which was a bit of a surprise to me when i looked it up.<p>The python interactive window has pretty much fully replaced my use of jupyter, since it gives you notebook-style output without the annoyance of the notebook format.  My usual workflow is highlighting lines of code and shift-enter to execute (there&#x27;s also a cells syntax).<p>I&#x27;m surprised by this because it _is_ possible to use R in Jupyter (although I never really liked the experience, R Studio was far superior).\n\n    ?<p>Yes it does.\n\n      Please supply references for the audience.\n\n      I&#x27;m specifically referring to:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;python&#x2F;jupyter-support-py\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;python&#x2F;jupyter-support-py</a><p>The support for R looks a bit different (to me at least?):\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;languages&#x2F;r\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;languages&#x2F;r</a><p>In the screenshot the window on the right does not look comparable to the output in a jupyter notebook.  It looks more like a standard terminal. e.g. does it support interactive charts, html tables etc?<p>The Python interactive window uses the ipykernel package to allow rich outputs like that.<p>I still might be wrong and would like to be corrected on this, since it would mean R support in VS Code is now better than I thought (I haven&#x27;t tried it fora. while)\n\n        I use r in a Jupyter Notebook in VS via IRKernel. It&#x27;s a gem.\n\n          Oh - nice, thanks - so it looks like the interactive window (which is effectivey the same as the output in a jupyter notebook) is also possible, but not (yet) &#x27;properly&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;officially&#x27; supported<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;REditorSupport&#x2F;vscode-R&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1412\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;REditorSupport&#x2F;vscode-R&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1412</a>\n\n  cat, grep, sort and awk come pretty close :)\n\n  Came here to share that same experience. RStudio truly made me feel &quot;close&quot; to the data.\n\n  An alternative in the Python world that is definitely worth looking into is the JupyterLab Desktop app, which is a standalone installer that is cross-platform and works great for beginners (no command line needed): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jupyterlab&#x2F;jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#jupyterlab-desktop\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jupyterlab&#x2F;jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-...</a><p>See my other comment in the main thread with more info.\n\nAre we just submitting GitHub repos as posts now?\n\n  I was thinking the same. R studio is certainly not new, either.\n\n  Hasn&#x27;t this been happening ever since GitHub opened?\n\n  The comment section is the most interesting after all, so why not link to the source instead of digging up a blog post no one will read anyway?\n\nIf I complain here will they fix my year old bug?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12508\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12508</a>\n\n  Can&#x27;t make any promises -- our dev team is pretty small! -- but it&#x27;s been flagged for triage.\n\n  This particular issue should be resolved in the latest daily builds of RStudio. The underlying issue here was a conda patch included in the conda-provided builds of R, which interfered with the way RStudio attempted to load R. Please see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;issues&#x2F;13184#issuecomment-1992709588\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;rstudio&#x2F;issues&#x2F;13184#issuecomment...</a> for more details.\n\n  The answer, it turns out, was yes!\n\nIt’s really nice to have everything you need in one spot. Plus it’ll run on any OS and is free. I started learning how to program with C++ back in the early 2000s which required Windows and a Visual Studio license and it was still a pain to get stuff done. Whether it’s RStudio or Jupyter there’s really never been a better time to start picking up a language and building something useful. Three cheers for the creators, maintainers and community who support tools like this.\n\n  Freemium is what they (&quot;Posit&quot;) are pivoting to now.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posit.co&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;individual-products&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posit.co&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;individual-products&#x2F;</a><p>If you want a Rstudio server to host for a research group containing more than 5 people, talk to their sales Rep.<p>Otherwise each person will need to host their own Rstudio server side-by-side on the same machine.<p>Jupyter and JupyterHub is the way forward.<p>Especially if they get multi-kernel notebooks mainlined (read: what Org-Mode has been doing for decades)\n\n    That pricing sheet is for Posit Workbench; RStudio Server[0] can host as many people as you have the compute for, and it&#x27;s free and open source. It does only support one session per user, but might meet the needs of a small research group.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posit.co&#x2F;download&#x2F;rstudio-server&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posit.co&#x2F;download&#x2F;rstudio-server&#x2F;</a>\n\nThe killer feature of RStudio for me is RMarkdown.<p>I composed almost all my homeworks in grad school using RMarkdown in RStudio. You get LaTeX whenever you need it, code (I usually use it for R or Julia), and markdown for ordinary text. The kable function renders tables nicely from data frames and ggplot2 creates beautiful plots.<p>Mathematica and Jupyter have a few advantages, but overall I&#x27;m very happy with RStudio.\n\n  RMarkdown in RStudio <i>was</i> the killer feature, until the VSCode R extension matured. Not only does it support RMarkdown, it adds a ton of features RStudio doesn&#x27;t have and runs a lot faster. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;REditorSupport&#x2F;vscode-R&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;R-Markdown\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;REditorSupport&#x2F;vscode-R&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;R-Markdown</a><p>For my uses, it replaced RStudio 100% of the time.\n\n    Thanks for the link! Is it possible to display plots inline like in notebooks? (The screenshot shows a plot in a preview pane.)\n\n      Unfortunately no. (tbh I don&#x27;t like that feature in RStudio anyways: it makes it longer to scroll through large notebooks, and ggsave is better at rendering charts than R&#x27;s native rendering)<p>For knitting, you can use Markdown image links.\n\n        Thanks for letting me know.\n\n    Can you use quarto in vscode? It&#x27;s the next magic from Posit.co\n\n      Yes, quarto has native support for VSCode: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarto.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;hello&#x2F;vscode.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarto.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;hello&#x2F;vscode.html</a><p>There isn&#x27;t much advantage to using it over RMarkdown for R, IMO.\n\n    That&#x27;s a lot of prerequisites for something that just works in rstudio.\n\n      It takes 5-10 minutes to set up the dependencies.\n\n        I&#x27;ll give it a try, your work has been an inspiration in the past so I trust your good taste!\n\nRStudio and the R language are a couple of my absolute favorite pieces of software. While I&#x27;m a software engineer by trade, every once in a while I need to do some data analysis work and throwing together a notebook in RStudio always makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a cheat code. For simple tasks, everything is incredibly seamless, plus coworkers who are unfamiliar with R are usually impressed by how nice ggplot visualizations can look.\n\nI enjoy RStudio but the best feature of R is data.table. It’s simply unmatched.\n\n  Once you climb that steep learning curve, absolutely.\n\n  Polars is faster? Data.table was a pioneering speed improvement at one point for sure.\n\n    It is but if we are talking speed, I’d just opt for RAPIDS.\n\nI think one of the most underrated pieces of software in modern history. Absolutely brilliant. Huge fan. I am glad to see it getting love. I’ve moved on from data science in a professional capacity but for some pet projects of mine it has been indispensable. I think managing the namespace was one non trivial concern (which may be resolved in modern versions). Otherwise very well built for data science applications. Interesting that it didn’t catch on for LLM training - I think a missed opportunity.\n\nAhh cool, now r-studio brings up this instead of the 24 year old data recovery program.... :-(\n\n  RStudio is thirteen years old so I&#x27;m not sure what changed that makes the search results different &quot;now&quot;\n\nI&#x27;m about as old school as you can get with preference for CLI and simple text-oriented development environments.  I recently picked up R again for a long-term data science project (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matttproud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;teaser-weather-temp-representation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matttproud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;teaser-weather-temp-repres...</a>) after having not used it since university.  In spite of a fair bit of annoyance with the R language (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matttproud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;rant-and-r-melt-function.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matttproud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;rant-and-r-melt-function.h...</a>), I found RStudio to make the prototyping process with R actually tolerable.  Big kudos to Posit and the R community for RStudio.<p>There are a couple of things I would love for the R ecosystem: project scaffolding to do bulk data generation (e.g., from continuously generated data sets).  What&#x27;s the best way to do this: makefiles, or what?  I have a relatively short entrypoint R file that sources other leaf files to run specific analyses, but it makes the software engineer inside of me want to curl up and die.\n\n  reshape2 (where `melt` is from) has been deprecated for some time, and for pretty good reasons. Try dplyr and tidyr instead - they are much nicer and modern. The equivalent of melt would be pivot_longer. For packaging, renv is the usual choice. I wouldn&#x27;t structure the package as a bunch of scripts with an entrypoint. Just write functions as you would in other languages, and keep any specific analysis script small.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidyr.tidyverse.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidyr.tidyverse.org&#x2F;</a>\n\nWeird one minute it feels like the internet is screaming that I’m an out-of-touch dinosaur for using R and the next a simple link to its most popular IDE makes the front of HN.\n\nThe closest Python equivalent to RStudio  is the JupyterLab Desktop app[1,2], which I highly recommend. I&#x27;ve entirely switched to using it for teaching, and it is a godsend, since it works the same way across platforms (win&#x2F;mac&#x2F;linux), installs its own Python interpreter independent of any system Python the student might have, and even comes with NumPy&#x2F;SciPy&#x2F;Pandas&#x2F;Seaborn&#x2F;statsmodels already installed, which makes it possible for me to skip the `pip ...` or `conda ...` instructions altogether.<p>Between the standalone desktop app, and the convenience of running JypyterLab in the cloud thanks to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mybinder.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mybinder.org&#x2F;</a> links, there is now a smooth path for beginners getting into stats&#x2F;ML&#x2F;data science: (1) read notebook on github or nbviewer, (2) run notebooks in the cloud via mybinder links, (3) install JupyterLab Desktop app, (4) learn to install Python+env-manager via command line. Previously, new learners were forced to jump straight to (4), but now there are logical steps along the way!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jupyterlab&#x2F;jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#jupyterlab-desktop\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jupyterlab&#x2F;jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jupyter.org&#x2F;jupyterlab-desktop-app-now-available-b8b661b17e9a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jupyter.org&#x2F;jupyterlab-desktop-app-now-availabl...</a>\n\n  Is it different from running through the web server? I found it to have a lot of potential but not there yet\n\n    It&#x27;s the same stack (jupyterlab server backend + web frontend) but wrapped as an electron app.<p>Yeah for sure when I use RStudio it seems much more polished, but I guess my attachment to (and comfort with) Python still makes it worthwhile to use JupterLab rather than switch to RStudio.\n\ni use jupyter a lot for python. i occasionally have to use rstudio for bioinformatics. the ux is much, much worse. just haven&#x27;t bothered to get the R kernel for jupyter working.\n\nIs there a way to visualize a dataframe like a spreadsheet, as RStudio does, but for VSCode?\n\nAhhh I started my programming with Rstudio. Since than I changed to Emacs with ESS.<p>Rstudio is nice but lacks a lot of nice things from something bigger.\n\nIf you work with Python, Spyder comes really, really close to RStudio and is way better than jupyter"

This assumes that people in the future are more or less like us, which is anybody&#x27;s guess.\n\n    I&#x27;m reading Stanisław Lem&#x27;s <i>Fiasco</i> at the moment (recommended to me from here) which is a sci-fi set sometime in the far future, probably at least 2500.<p>I&#x27;m enjoying it, but characters are <i>constantly</i> saying things like &quot;imagine if people from 1950, or even 1990, saw our ships descend from the sky...&quot; Dude, 500 years from now you think people are going to have a good idea of 1950 vs 1990?? And this is on top of other things, like every work of literature that characters reference is from the 20th c.\n\n      Reminds me of reading Asimov&#x27;s books set in the distant future and they still use tapes and other things from the 1950&#x27;s. Maybe if pressed he could argue that the technology in the future was vastly different, but wanted to use the name of a storage media his readers were familiar with and avoid having to make up a new word.\n\n        Which is why Star Wars is set &quot;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...&quot;; things look dated now? Well of course, it was a long time ago!\n\n      Not familiar with that particular story, but doesn&#x27;t it just reflect the popular mid-late twentieth century scifi conceit that interstellar travel would start at the end of the twentieth century and be the <i>most important thing ever</i>? In which case the 1950&#x2F;90 distinction probably would be a consideration for someone with a half decent knowledge of history, a bit like someone today saying &quot;imagine telling someone in 1450 or even 1492 what the Americas would be like today...&quot;<p>Minus points for thinking the literature would stand the test of time though :)\n\n      &gt; like every work of literature that characters reference is from the 20th c<p>A lot of literature today refers to bronze age religious texts(2700 years ago), Shakespeare(400 years ago), the Ramayana(2600-3kya), Romance of the Three Kingdoms(600ya), and so on. There are threads of Porto-Indoeuropean mythology preserved in the Vedas, Roman Mythology, and the Scandinavian Sagas.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about Australian Aboriginal mythology, but there&#x27;s strong evidence that their stories contain accurate details of extinct species and geographic features from thousands of years ago.<p>So it seems entirely possible that enough  cultural material from the mid 20th century will survive until the 2500s for people at that time to have a good understanding of the 1950s in at least some places.\n\n  You would probably find &quot;motel of the mysteries&quot; a fun read :-)\n\nThat axe-head looks really well-crafted. Was definitely somebody&#x27;s prized possession.\n\n  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting to me. Even after a fire, wouldn&#x27;t someone want to go scrape through the remains to find stuff like that?<p>To me that seems like that might lean towards a deliberate fire &#x2F; untimely fate for the inhabitants from an enemy, who might not know where that axe would have been stored.\n\n    Or maybe the fire was understood divine punishment for something arbitrary and digging through the site would anger the gods even more. With out clear evidence its hard to say anything about the cause.\n\n    I assumed it fell into the bog and so it was basically impossible to get to?\n\nGood NYT article as well<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;science&#x2F;archaeology-britain-must-farm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;science&#x2F;archaeology-brita...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;R2nA5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;R2nA5</a><p>A tidbit I found interesting:<p>&gt; Interest in Must Farm was first aroused in 1999 when a Cambridge University archaeologist spied a series of oak posts poking out of the beds of clay at the quarry. Dendrochronology dated the poles to prehistory,<p>I love that dendrochronology is now at a level that we can quickly look at some tree rings from a fragment of wood and fairly accurately date it. From my understanding, though the field has been around for a while, it&#x27;s only been in the past decade or so that we&#x27;re able to do that kind of thing.\n\n&gt; Archaeologists also unearthed a woman’s skull, smooth from touch, possibly a keepsake of a lost loved one.<p>Everything else - the kitchen tools, the animal domestication - seems relatable. And then we get to the skull smoothing…\n\n  Someone&#x27;s going to look back at people with urns of ashes, and think the same thing.\n\n    Keeping a loved-one&#x27;s skull around seems downright tame compared to how some people treat their dead in modern times.

Most machines can’t come close.\n\n  In the 200MB (lite!) pdf book they suggest the finest woven objects (and most of the metal-work) were from regional trade not produced locally. And many of the items of the site came from Ireland and some as far away as Iran.\n\nVery interesting.

It cant speak for itself, not with words, so you are free to tell the story that it&#x27;s just you in there.\n\n    The pure soul was corrupted and converted to an NPC, beaten by rules and structure to follow a clear path where choice is an illusion.\n\nMaybe those infant memories exist, but they aren&#x27;t accessible to our adult minds because our understanding of sensory data at the time was so different from our more developed minds?<p>The data is still there, but it&#x27;s in a forgotten file format.\n\n  I had a friend who had a sibling that had a mental illness.<p>When she was ill, she could recall other memories while she was ill.<p>and vice versa.  She could not recall what she did when she was ill while on medication.<p>Sort of more than plain memories too, like how she was thinking, deciding, frame of mind, what she felt, etc.\n\n  and the hardware has been updated.\n\n  We are, all of us, born EBCDIC.    The world teaches us ASCII, and we can make no sense of all we knew.\n\n  This was my guess. I believe I have experienced this as an adult too: I played on a special Minecraft server (an anarchy server) for a year or so, and despite spending so much time on it, I can hardly remember my first few days on there. I have no memory at all of being at the spawn location. I believe it&#x27;s because of what you described - as I continued to play on the server, my understanding of how it worked changed completely so my initial memories no longer made sense under my new framework.\n\n  I think it’s similar to that, but the analogy doesn’t quite hold.<p>It’s a bit more like they’re there, on the hard drive, but they aren’t in the FAT.<p>Our memories operate on association, be that by topic or by causal chain. Infant memories are laid down without those associations.<p>I have some early conscious memories - I remember my second birthday, our neighbour walking on stilts in his garden, finding a snake in a gutter at the end of our garden - things which left an impression. I know these are memories as my parents have zero recall of any of these events, yet talking to my au pair of the time a few years ago, she, who was present, does remember the stilts, and the snake.<p>Interestingly, since having an infant daughter of my own, I feel those primordial memories that I don’t consciously recall far more presently - I’ll cuddle her just so, or will tuck her into bed, or will make stupid noises while feeding her, and will have a moment of “she is the baby. I am the baby. She is the baby” with either just a feeling of familiarity or in some cases a brief glimpse of visual information.<p>It’s an interesting topic - along with how “past life” memories form, as apparently about as soon as I could talk I was keen to lecture anyone who would listen on mongol siege warfare in the levant.\n\n  Wish I was able to covert some files to &quot;a forgotten file format&quot;\n\n  I am likewise of the opinion, having observed various things (in particular how people in severely altered states of consciousness like dissociative drugs can sometimes remember things from previous experiences that they cannot recall when not on those drugs), that a lot of memory &quot;loss&quot; is just that our process of memory recall is basically setting the same variables and then running the machine again, and if the code has churned since then, obviously the result will vary (and then be written as varied, since memory recall also stores the new result) - and if it&#x27;s churned too much, it fails sanity checks entirely.\n\n  That kinda jives with &quot;compression is understanding&quot;. If recalling a memory depends, as a sibling comment says, on &quot;re-running the machine&quot;, then you can&#x27;t recall it if you can&#x27;t intuit how you thought at the time.<p>As if you compressed a chess game by using a chess engine and saying, &quot;The move ranked #2, the move ranked #1, the move ranked #1&quot; and some very tight arithmetic encoding. If you come back and decompress it with a different engine, it&#x27;ll put out similar results for a little bit, then diverge into nonsense.<p>(All speculation, for fun of course)<p>Sometimes I feel at odds with my memories. There are certain images I always return to, and I&#x27;m not sure why. I&#x27;m not even sure what emotions they evoke. Nostalgia, I guess. There is one overseas trip where I barely remember anything, except that I hated it. I feel like I fucked up my childhood and need a do-over, but they say everyone feels that.\n\n&gt; You might think you remember... when you were 18 months old, or that time you had chickenpox when you were 2—but you almost certainly don’t... People generally remember nothing from before age 3<p>I have distinct visual and auditory memories from when I was about 15 months old and going forward. I can still recall them in exact detail. These were not events anyone ever spoke of, to plant seeds as it were; it was many years later in my early teenage years when my parents were reminiscing about their first house in Texas that I recalled them to my parents and they were flabergasted. It had never occurred to me that not everyone (turns out most people, it seems) don&#x27;t have memories going back that far.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think it makes me &quot;special&quot; — it&#x27;s just something about how I remember things: very, very visually, kind of immersive &quot;full screen&quot; in my mind&#x27;s eye.\n\n  Maybe it&#x27;s (something similar to) Eidetic Memory<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eidetic_memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eidetic_memory</a>\n\n  I would say I have a poor to average memory and I can recall one mundane scene from being an infant.  I was also creeped out when my 3 or 4 year old brother said he could remember being in the womb.\n\n  I do 100% remember starting at 18 months verified by parents.  Memories not remembered are forgotten.\n\n  I can remember a handful of scenes dating back to age 2 or 3, and maybe a bit earlier. How well varies, like as I’m writing this my recall ability is somewhat weak, likely because I’m tired. If they happen to cross my mind earlier during the day when I’m more alert they’re fairly vivid, considering their age (~33 years).\n\n  I think it was on HN, a blog&#x2F;story about a guy that walked around the world a number of times — over the course of a decade or so.<p>I recall the extreme isolation, boredom allowed him, in time, to go completely back to his earliest childhood in his memories.<p>Maybe someone remembers that article.\n\n    Yeah it seems like memory is a graph and you need the right path to get somewhere. Sometimes distant memories only have a few ways in and you don’t have a world map.\n\n  We moved out of our first house when I just turned 4.\nMany years later as a young adult when we were discussing research on early childhood memories with my parents (specifically the theory that children form childhood memories seeded by parents retelling), I surprised my parents by drawing the layout of our home, my nanny’s house and the school. Like you,  I have very clear visual memories and can remember scene very well (but people‘s face lack details which is logical considering that I’m incapable of recognizing people)\n\n    I remember our dog lying down next to me when I was a baby. Problem is, we didn’t have a dog when I was a baby. Maybe I invented the memory, maybe it was a different dog. Without any way to verify people’s recollections, these are just cute anecdotes.\n\n      True and in this case it’s hard to do research. But in my specific case since I could actually draw the layout and my parents verified it, I know that the memories were accurate. There is no other way for me to have that information, there was very little photos back then (film was expensive), we moved far away from that village and never came back so I couldn’t have gained the information afterwards but I could draw a layout and write out the color of the walls for each room.<p>That said how would you design a study to validate this? If parents or members of the family are the only ones with the information to verify this, it’s hard to eliminate the conflict of interest.<p>Also in the age of digital cameras children nowadays are much more likely to have a big library of photos or videos of their early childhood and be able to reconstruct memories based on looking at them later.\n\n        Yes, I really don’t know how you’d run a study.<p>Take thousands of children, give them some kind of experience without explaining why, and without anyone they know being there. Then ask them questions about it 20 years later. Have control groups where parents and photos give them information - some true, some false - at different intervals.<p>Interesting thought experiment, though impractical and probably unethical. But without that kind of independent verification it’s impossible to say you can accurately recall childhood memories. While your story is harmless, it can get dangerous when people recall crimes that may not have happened in the way they think.\n\n  &quot;almost certainly don’t&quot; is strong language - but they&#x27;re not saying you don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll interpret as meaning that most of our memories were &quot;implanted&quot; but by no means all.<p>I have very strong visual memories of events from when I was still in a crib to the present. Lots of those memories are from when I was alone so there was nobody who could have implanted them.<p>Also, neuroscience says (unless theories have changed) that all memories are &quot;implanted&quot; in that memory works like DRAM. Every time we remember something, it&#x27;s getting retrieved and then written back to long term storage. It&#x27;s a destruction-recreation process.\n\n  I remember my mother changing my nappy, she laid me on top of the washing machine. cant remember what age that was but it was definitely within the first year of my life.\n\n  How do you know the memories are accurate? How do you know how the memories got there?\n\nRefreshing to see my old Prof quoted. This is an intensely intriguing area of research, not only the natural occurring phenomenon of infantile amnesia but also the experiments created to explore this area. For example tagging and reactivating engrams in separate contexts has shown us how to essentially create false memories, exposing possible mechanisms of PTSD triggers, further, stressing mothers or pups out in critical post-partem periods has revealed how not only early life stress can impact physiology, but that epigenetic changes can occur in the mother that then affect the physiology and functioning of subsequent litters.\n\n&gt; However real they may seem, your earliest treasured memories were probably implanted by seeing photos or hearing your parents’ stories about waiting in line for the spinning teacups.<p>Call me skeptical of this explanation.<p>As a small talk conversation starter, I&#x27;ve developed a habit of asking people what their earliest memory was.<p>For lots of people they don&#x27;t have any memories from early childhood.  I&#x27;d say the most common age I hear is around 5 or 6.  The oldest I heard was a 30-year-old who doesn&#x27;t remember anything before high school.<p>But when there are those early memories, they are short, strong, and associated with fear.  But not consequential in the &#x27;lore&#x27; that a parent would develop about a child.<p>One girl told me about a time when she was at a restaurant with her dad. He got up and left the booth, and she was scared to be alone.<p>Another story was about throwing a toy car and watching it puncture a soda can, which then began spraying, and being scared, not knowing what was going on.<p>A guy related a story to me about hearing their parents talk about being pregnant with their sibling (who is 2 years younger than them).  And he distinctly remembers their emotions, their stress, and how it made him feel (scared).<p>It&#x27;s not like the parents are telling their kids about that one time they got up for a few minutes in a restaurant or that one scary time a dog barked at them or that time they rode in a car with a cigarette smoker and the smell was disgusting.<p>They&#x27;ll remember one sensory input like the image of a can spraying soda or the smell of smoke or the words someone said and then they&#x27;ll remember, distinctly, the emotion.  When they tell the story, you can tell they know exactly how they felt in the moment.<p>That just doesn&#x27;t jive with saying they reconstructed those memories.\n\n  &gt; But when there are those early memories, they are short, strong, and associated with fear.<p>Yep, although I&#x27;d expand that to any strong emotion. I have early memories of embarrassing moments and times when I had a lot of fun also.<p>But the first thing I can still remember was definitely fear, as it was of me drowning, at age... I want to say 3, but I&#x27;m not sure exactly when it was anymore, maybe it was 4. We were on vacation visiting my grandparents in another state, and were in their pool. I was to stay against the side &#x27;cleaning the pool&#x27; by using a scrub brush and rubbing it on the ledge of the pool, and apparently at one point I didn&#x27;t stick to the ledge, because I remember going under and swallowing some water and my parents noticing and coming to my rescue. I ate cheese and crackers at their table afterwards. He also had a golf cart and I remember driving that up and down the block.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it for that young. Next thing after that is while I was in pre-school, and I only remember a few things from that time.<p>And for anything earlier than like, high school, I don&#x27;t have a lot more than just a few images I can mentally pull up of any given memory, and the knowledge of what happened on a kind of basic level (anything too detailed is pretty much gone now).<p>And if there are pictures that helps a lot. I can remember a few details not present in the pictures, but without the pictures I doubt I&#x27;d remember that happening at all.\n\n  &gt; associated with fear<p>I think this is true.  And I recall reading that adrenaline helps form strong memories, which makes sense (best to remember your existential fear of tigers forever)<p>I was young, maybe 2nd grade, and the teacher pointedly ignored my raised hand.  I ended up peeing in my chair.  I remember it pretty well.  :)<p>I also remember revisiting that 2nd grade classroom, and the room (and desks!) was MUCH smaller than I remember.  My memories were from eyeballs closer to the ground looking around at a spacious room.\n\n  I also have a hobby of asking people what their earliest memory was.<p>My first memory is firmly datable to 10 days after my 3rd birthday. The assassination of John F. Kennedy was announced over the radio while I has sitting down with my mum at the kitchen table. Not a particularly traumatic memory. The response was surprisingly intellectual: something along the lines of &quot;hmm the world is complicated&quot;, so not particularly traumatic. The memory has definitely never been externally re-implanted, but I sometimes wonder if it is a memory of a memory of a memory. It is nonetheless very vivid with lots of visual detail. There are a few other memories that are of events that occurred before my 4th birthday, but none that can be firmly dated.<p>I agree. In my experience, first memories dating to 5, 6 or 7 years old, or occasionally even later are pretty common; those dating to 3 or 4 years old, less common. I&#x27;ve never met anyone who has a memory that can be dated to before their 3rd birthday.<p>But the biggest challenge for almost everyone is attaching dates to early memories.\n\nMemory is malleable.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;am-i-right&#x2F;201307&#x2F;your-memory-isnt-what-you-think-it-is\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;am-i-right&#x2F;201307&#x2F;yo...</a><p>Your earliest memories have had the most chances to be changed and not reflect what really happened.<p>So what, exactly, might not be gone? Something that formed early and was edited over and over and over by experiences through a lifetime?\n\n&gt; You might think you remember taking a trip to Disneyland when you were 18 months old, or that time you had chickenpox when you were 2—but you almost certainly don’t. However real they may seem, your earliest treasured memories were probably implanted by seeing photos or hearing your parents’ stories about waiting in line for the spinning teacups. Recalling those manufactured memories again and again consolidated them in your brain, making them as vivid as your last summer vacation.<p>But not always. I have a handful of memories from before I was 2 and a half, and they&#x27;re real.  I know because they&#x27;re mainly of mundane stuff that would be unremarkable to adults but would have been much more significant to a small child (e.g. apartment maintenance man coming to fix an appliance).  No one would tell a kid stories of that stuff.<p>I also know they&#x27;re from before 2.5 because that&#x27;s when we moved from an apartment to a house, and they were clearly from a different home.  I think that&#x27;s probably why I remember them today: they were obviously very early, so I valued them even as a very young child an rehearsed them.  A few of them got distorted and <i>mixed</i> with stuff from a little later (e.g one of being outside my old apartment, being shown something my parents confirmed was there, but the setting was transmogrified with features of an apartment I was regularly <i>driven by</i> as a 3+ year old).\n\n  &gt; mundane stuff that would be unremarkable to adults but would have been much more significant to a small child (e.g. apartment maintenance man coming to fix an appliance). No one would tell a kid stories of that stuff.<p>While I believe you, I rehearse stories with my 2 year old about mundane things that happened yesterday, last week, last month to him a few times a day.<p>That said I am pretty confident the article is correct both from my personal experience and what I’ve read as a layperson regarding child development.<p>There’s a lot of research about biographical stories being a very American cultural phenomenon. My parents never did this with me, and I have maybe 1&#x2F;10th-1&#x2F;100th of the memories of childhood compare to an average American with no immigrant parents.\n\n    &gt; While I believe you, I rehearse stories with my 2 year old about mundane things that happened yesterday, last week, last month to him a few times a day.<p>Not my memory. The one I&#x27;m specifically referring too is a visual memory of a very specific cleanup activity I don&#x27;t think my parents even saw or would talk about.  It&#x27;s certainly not something they would have talked about later.\n\n  I have memories from when I was 3. They are blurry and scarce of details, but I know they are mine and untainted because nobody else remembered those episodes. They could confirm details they hadn&#x27;t thought of until then.<p>The same happens with more recent memories of what happened 10 or even 20 years later: not everybody remembers when I recall a shared experience, but some do. So, at least I know my brain isn&#x27;t fabricating tales.<p>What I can&#x27;t understand is that most of those memories aren&#x27;t traumatic. Not even of important events e.g. asking my very young mother how to tell apart left sock from right sock ;(\n\nI have a single memory before I was 6 months old. I was young enough to not be able to move much, not even to flip over, and everything was black and white. It was not a story my parents planted. I remember being in a crib and being picked up by my father. That’s it. For a long time, I thought it was something when I was older, until I had kids of my own and had a better idea of infant development.<p>The more I recall this memory, the more I can tell, I am recalling a copy of the memory rather than directly experiencing that memory.\n\n  Maybe there is something to this kind of moment as being particularly memorable, because one of the distinct moments I can recall that I know had to have been before 12 months was playing on the floor with my grandfather. He had a stroke not long after, which is how I know this had to have been the timeline. I can see the 1970s carpet, I know he was there bouncing me around as you do with a baby, and then mom came around the corner. That stuff can&#x27;t just be an implanted suggestion from a picture - it almost makes me wonder is there a kind of micro trauma of being separated from the adult and then seeing them again that provokes a memory to be generated? Is there something novel about this kind of moment that causes memory to kick in and capture the moment, even though I can&#x27;t remember what I ate for lunch yesterday?\n\n  Yeah I have similar memories. By now they are memories of recalled memories, degraded like an old VHS tape. But I am certain they are real because they meant a lot to me when I was very young (but older than a toddler). I.e. I have toddler memories I often returned to as a young kid.\n\n  I also have one from when I was a baby.<p>A woman who wasn&#x27;t my mother carried me out from a house porch into the sunlight with my head on her left hand (heart) side.<p>There isn&#x27;t much more to it and I try to not recall it too hard and&#x2F;or often because it&#x27;s far too easy to add false detailing to it.\n\n  &quot;The more I recall this memory, the more I can tell, I am recalling a copy of the memory rather than directly experiencing that memory. &quot;<p>I feel that is very true. I have some memories from when I was young that aren&#x27;t really clear to me. It&#x27;s more of a feeling thing rather than something specific.<p>And every time I think on that I wonder how much my mind fills in that I didn&#x27;t remember.\n\nWhy do some people have no memories of their early childhood (below 5-6 years) while others remember quite a bit from the time that they were 2-3?<p>I have strong memories of my life since I was 3. My wife, otoh, says she can’t remember anything until she was 6+\n\n  Why are some people 5ft tall and some people 6ft? Why are some people perpetually in a bad mood and other people are annoying? I would be more surprised if everyone was the same.\n\n    Well, we know why some people are 5ft tall and some are 6ft (genetics and diet).<p>I’m asking do we know why some people retain early childhood memories and some don’t?\n\n      Genetics and RNGesus.\n\nI&#x27;ve thought a lot about this over the years as it feels like I can remember a lot from before the age of three. This has gotten me thinking if I&#x27;m really remembering, or if say, pictures of events or things parents shared caused me to believe I was remembering. The thing is though, much of what I really remember is stuff I&#x27;ve never talked about with anyone - the first time I saw a dead bird or playing in the sandbox or seeing the sagebrush blow by from the backseat of the car on a road trip that must have been 1978. And, the more I create prompts for myself - say something like &quot;What can I remember about my Kindergarten classroom?&quot; for example, the more the memories start flooding back. Heck, I feel like I can remember individual days at pre-school, and I would have only been 3 or 4. I definitely remember the Iran hostage crisis being on TV at grandma&#x27;s house, and I wouldn&#x27;t have been more than 2 when that happened.<p>All that to say... I think some of it is the result of either novelty or trauma. Like when the brain first experiences something, it is more likely to make a point to remember it over it being something less novel and thus less memorable. What&#x27;s odd to me is I can remember pictures of some events that must have happened before I was about 4 that I really don&#x27;t remember apart from seeing the pictures and acknowledging that apparently I was there - which tells me the things I do remember must be actual memories rather than some kind of implanted suggestion.\n\n  &gt; I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this over the years as it feels like I can remember a lot from before the age of three.<p>Some people can, some cannot. My first memory is when I couldn&#x27;t yet speak, could barely walk, was near some big pot, wanted to go inside, dad put me inside, then immediately started crying because I couldn&#x27;t get out myself, dad took me out. We had that pot until about 5yr ago, it was about 30L.<p>But overall, I had maybe only a dozen total memories up to middle school that I can remember last time I wondered about this (when pondering Johnny Mnemonic plot). I have overall pretty bad memory. I was even on one memory training course, but it didn&#x27;t help.<p>Our memories work associatively, so probably we have a lot of memories which we can&#x27;t access just because they are not associated properly or we don&#x27;t remember the triggers. Probably there is some &quot;list of triggers&quot; association with some memories working like an index.\n\nExcept for one scene, I don&#x27;t recall anything before 5 years old.<p>However, there is always something that bothered me: I remember the  exact moment at 5 years old where I got out of the shower room confused and afraid because I could not remember anything.<p>So it is not like my memory gradually faded, but really that there is a specific moment in time when it happened.<p>I also remember that at several times in my life, from as early as 5~6 and up to today, I was wondering about the fact that I could not remember anything from before 5 (like a recursive memory).<p>Anyone else in this case?\n\nYou don&#x27;t really remember a childhood memory unless you can bring back the feeling you had at the time, and that only happens sometimes, on its own. If you could remember your childhood as it really was you&#x27;d think adult life is hollow and fake by comparison."

But calling an AI generated set of antibodies a “landmark moment” when they don’t do what we want antibodies to do is a bit… inappropriate?\n\n      Landmark moment because it&#x27;s the first time? Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s an accomplishment in itself? Just like the first flight, or the first satellite, none of those were particular impressive.\n\n        I’m assuming you have no background in antibodies, but this is like saying “this is the first time AI put together a sentence but it doesn’t mean anything”.<p>The purpose of antibody development is to develop something that binds well.  That’s the goal.  So basically AI designed something useless.\n\n          It was also pretty useless to shoot a dog into space by your standard.\n\n            all endeavor of sending dogs&#x2F;monkeys&#x2F;humans into space looks like brought very little benefits so far\n\n            If you want to use your analogy it would be like sending a dog into space and having the rocket explode.\n\n    In this case AI could fly 120ft, while humans already were flying to the moon.\n\n      No<p>The analogy should be that birds can fly thousands of miles when comparing with human flight\n\n  This reads like some kind of Napoleonic complex.\n\n  The news is that antibodies were created from scratch for the first time.

Other than it being a learned behavior from humans. Wouldn&#x27;t a &quot;conscious&quot; AI quickly accelerate its knowledge and wisdom well beyond human condition? Also, wouldn&#x27;t the machine recognise that humans could be good resources? In that case more likely to hire us or enslave us.\n\n    Are we not men ?

It seems Apple and Google are not used to that.\n\n  &gt; intent&#x2F;spirit of their laws<p>As inconsistently interpreted by the member states, each with their own political biases and concerns. It’s a complicated, increasingly risky, and unpredictable market for tech firms.<p>Ultimately that’s fine, it’s not a necessity the EU be a leader in AI (except perhaps in defense).\n\n&gt; The competition authority said Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard – since rebranded as Gemini – was trained on content from publishers and news agencies without notifying them.<p>An important reason—amongst others—why projects like ChatGPT cannot be conceived inside Google anymore. Yeah, it&#x27;s sad how legal, privacy, and compliance teams have expanded to obstruct any significant engineering project, but there are genuine reasons why.\n\n  So why does Google seem to have such significant issues trying to catch up despite violating these laws and agreements at every chance it can? Apparently using all this data does not help them all that much.\n\n    I think the point is that others are using this data as well, but not a target given there&#x27;s no gigantic piggy bank to extract $ from.\n\n      Or rather, the others don&#x27;t have preexisting agreements due to previous grievances.<p>For OpenAI this would be the first violation of regulations about news content reproduction. That would be lengthy court case with an uncertain outcome. But Google already went through such a court case (before Gemini was a thing), settled, and now with Gemini violated the settlement agreement. Showing that they violated the settlement agreement is much easier and quicker, so that&#x27;s the news you get today.\n\n        Indeed. I was about to link to the news from December that the New York Times is suing OpenAI for using their news articles.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fingfx.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;gfx&#x2F;legaldocs&#x2F;byvrkxbmgpe&#x2F;OPENAI%20MICROSOFT%20NEW%20YORK%20TIMES%20mtd.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fingfx.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;gfx&#x2F;legaldocs&#x2F;byvrkxbmgpe&#x2F;...</a><p>I have no legal training, so my guess is as good as coin flip for how this is going to turn out.\n\n          That one seems to be NYTimes not understanding how LLM&#x27;s work, and will hinge on technical clarifications (either OpenAI used NyTimes articles in training their model [fault], or the NyTimes seeded their prompt with enough article snippets to reproduce it [not at fault]).\n\n    Is there any evidence that OpenAI is <i>not</i> using the same data?  They&#x27;re just not big enough for the regulators to aim at yet.\n\n      Considering the country in question, is there any evidence that Mistral is not using the same data?\n\n      Or maybe there just isn&#x27;t evidence they&#x27;ve used it?  Whereas for Google, we do have evidence they used that data.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m all for these companies disclosing their training data. But just assuming OpenAI isn&#x27;t fined because of their site is (unless you know more) pure speculation. Same goes for the sibling comment suggesting Mistral should also be looked at\n\n        One difference between ChatGPT &amp; Gemini on one hand and Mistral on the other hand, is that Mistral is an open source model.\nCan&#x27;t say the same thing for OpenAI and Google LLMs.\n\n  A big part of the problem might be that Google tries to do everything in house. Many companies use contractors or third-party software to reduce the risk in these areas. Most of the innovative work is also being done outside of Google. Cheaper, too. One of Google’s own AI researchers said as much.<p>Imagine Google investing in a huge ecosystem of 3rd party tools that could solve their problems with the deal being OSS or shared-source deliverables they could use. That they’re independent puts most liability on them. For whatever is shared, Google could still support their managers, lawyers, etc in situations of mutual interest.<p>If Google wasn’t so focused on control and ego, then they could take advantage of such strategies to receive all their benefits. Google is suffering strictly because of their operational choices that increase liability, not E.U. regulations. They <i>could</i> suffer for E.U. regulations in a future situation where they’re doing their best but E.U. bullied them anyway. We’re not there yet.\n\nI was going to get caught up watching 2 of my foes battle (copyright &amp; Google) but then this grew in my head until it was all I could think of:<p><pre><code>     This fine was issued now and not after 15 years of [process].</code></pre>\n\nI see more and more AI solutions to be simply not available in European Union. EU is a big market, true, but apparently not big enough to justify all the hassle, risks of handling random bureaucrats who want to become famous because they managed to fine some rich company. EU managed to enforce GDPR to some extent (still many parties are practically ignoring it by making refusal for tracking really annoying), question how it will play out with AI.\n\n  I tried to sign up for Claude 3 the other day but was met with a message that it’s not available in Sweden (which is a EU member state). It was available in Suriname though, so it’s not just a “US only for now” policy.<p>Really irritating. But yes, we deserve it.\n\n    the list specifically excludes EU countries<p>as always, it helps to maintain an identity in several geopolitical &#x27;blocks&#x27;, this time Montenegro worked :)\n\n    So you could still use it, you just had to lie about where you where?\n\n      Not commercially\n\n  The saddest part is that many legislations in other parts of the world try to blindly copy the european legislation, without any effort in thinking if it makes sense or not.\n\n    that&#x27;s not that sad, especially when talking abt gdpr. I mean gdpr can be better by enforcing respecting some request headers but other than that, gdpr is good, just like punishing unauthorized use of other&#x27;s work\n\n  Sadly they are not enforcing it for european websites (maybe by design?), a lot of accept cookies or pay nowadays.\n\n    I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a gray area. Several of these schemes have been found in violation (Heise&#x27;s implementation of it got them sued for example and they had to modify it). The bigger point here is that ONLY European websites have been going that route whereas American websites mostly just try to circumvent the GDPR by being clever (e.g. abusing the legal term &quot;legitimate interest&quot; to add a tedious layer of opt-outs), which hilariously backfires because it demonstrates that the violation is intentional.<p>Note that the point with the compliant &quot;accept or pay&quot; ones is that they still can&#x27;t coerce you to &quot;accept all&quot; - they still have to only bundle the minimum necessary and justify it, and they then have to opt out paying users from those. Keep in mind that the ePrivacy Directive explicitly requires having an &quot;refuse all&quot; (or in this case &quot;accept minimum necessary&quot;) button with equal weight and visibility as an &quot;accept all&quot; if the latter exists. Most consent dialogs are still in violation of this as they didn&#x27;t update since the GDPR initially came into effect.\n\n  What is it with making this a bureaucracy problem before addressing the fact that AI models are often fed data that doesn&#x27;t belong to the company training the model, which has usually been gathered with methods that would be considered outright theft or corporate espionage in other industries?<p>Of course there are bureaucracy issues, and there always will be, but I think it&#x27;s absolutely not the main topic here.\n\n    If they harvest massive amounts of copyrighted and suspect data and send the worst parts of it to strangers over the Internet, everyone calls it &quot;ML&quot; and &quot;training&quot; and investors give them billions in funding but when I do it they call me a pirate and a pervert and throw me in jail.\n\n  &gt; risks of handling random bureaucrats who want to become famous because they managed to fine some rich company<p>Do list the names of famous bureaucrats that got famous because they fined rich companies. There&#x27;s Margrethe Vestager who is the commissioner for competition, and is neither famous nor famous for finning rich companies.<p>Also, do you have any actual criticism of specific legislation or is this a generic &quot;laws bad because they make it harder for business which is bad&quot; rant without any substance?\n\n    &gt; Do list the names of famous bureaucrats that got famous because they fined rich companies.<p>Thierry Breton is another name that comes to mind.\n\n      The guy who was a CEO of a top 10 digital services (?) company worldwide, Atos, and before that of the biggest French telecom (France Telecom&#x2F;Orange). He was named 3 times in the top 100 CEOs by Harvard Business Review. He was a minister of economics, finances and industry for 2 years. Also has a few sci-fi books.<p>And for you, he became popular when he was named European Commissioner? Which company did he fine to become famous with his new position?\n\n        The dude who can&#x27;t submit a post to Twitter&#x2F;bsky without including a glamor shot of himself?\n\n      Never heard of her.<p>The only actual example I can think of is Schrems and he didn&#x27;t fine anyone, he merely dismantled the shoddily constructed EU-US privacy law circumventions (Privacy Shield etc). And I had to look up his first name (Max) because I only knew his name from the court cases (notably Schrems II).\n\n        Heh, great illustration of how hollow the &quot;politician acting for fame&quot; accusation is: the only name you could think of is of an EFF-like <i>activist</i>, he&#x27;s not a politician at all :D\n\n          Turns out I had him down as a &quot;politician&quot; because I conflated him with the Greens politician who was doing elaborate flow charts on Brexit on social media. Incidentally I also forgot his name too.<p>I saw he&#x27;s only listed as a &quot;lawyer&quot; (not a political position or party membership) when looking up his full name but given that I know literally nothing else about him (the face doesn&#x27;t even feel familiar) I left it at that.\n\n        Also, he&#x27;s not a bureaucrat or politician.\n\n  It&#x27;s not the EU&#x27;s fault that the US government has been completely useless for so long that big tech thinks they have a right to trample all over society to make an extra buck.\n\n    Couldn’t one argue that the current system is expressly in the <i>interest</i> of the US government? We are entering a new technological age with the US at the forefront and the EU falling further behind while busily erecting more obstacles. Economically, at least.<p>If it’s not US companies, it will just be Chinese ones. Homegrown isn’t an option the EU places much value on.\n\n      The US was stricter on its homegrown giants of the past, so I don&#x27;t really buy into the idea that the US has to let big tech impose all of its dystopian ideals upon people to retain a lead over China.<p>The current approach may be benefiting the US economically, but it&#x27;s also ticking up a time bomb in the form of an increasingly pissed off public.\n\n  The EU is also going to miss out on new AI companies, so no only are they at a competitive disadvantage because they&#x27;re using less AI, they also aren&#x27;t getting the job and tax benefits from the new companies that will form.\n\nI wonder through what mechanism they were able to fine them for bard&#x2F; Gemini, since it&#x27;s not really clear that training an LLM is a copyright violation. Is it through those prior commitments made in 2019 or whatever?\n\n  Imo the definition of piracy is rather clear - illegally copying of protected content that infringes the owner&#x27;s copyright.<p>If not training, then possession perhaps?\n\n    How do you define a copy? Is the data sent over HDMI to your monitors memory a copy?\n\n      Were LLMs trained on a data processed via HDMI? Are you sure you&#x27;re not confusing copy with processing?\n\n  Its because the EU has something called &quot;neighbouring rights&quot; which are an additional right to the usual form of copyrights.<p>&gt; To tackle this, the EU created a form of copyright called “neighbouring rights” that allows print media to demand compensation for using their content.\n\n    In some EU countries, like Austria for example, there are royalties to pay on non-volatile storage memory[1], who&#x27;s funds go to the local mafia...errr I mean music&#x2F;movie rights holders association, because get this, storage can be used for storing reproductions of copyrighted content, so if you buy anything from external HDDs to phones with flash memory, then you&#x27;re automatically a potential pirate and you owe them money upfront to compensate them for the piracy induced losses.<p>It&#x27;s a tax that started from the 1980&#x27;s first on audio and VHS cassettes, and kept getting updated over the years to include MP3 players, flash memory, smart phones and smart watches.<p>I expect the exact same thing will happen to LLM bots. The juggernauts like Ringier or Axel Springer will lobby in their respective countries or at EU level to get their pound of flesh whenever people use something like ChatGPT, because they&#x27;ll claim it was trained on their copyrighted data and so they deserve to get their cut, otherwise the service will have to be banned in the EU.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-wko-at.translate.goog&#x2F;oe&#x2F;handel&#x2F;maschinen-technologie&#x2F;urheberrecht-festplattenabgabe-speichermedienverguetung?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-wko-at.translate.goog&#x2F;oe&#x2F;handel&#x2F;maschinen-techno...</a><p><pre><code>  | Integrated memory in mobile phones:                                                            EUR 2.50 |\n  | Integrated storage in tablets:                                                                 EUR 3.75 |\n  | Integrated memory in PC, desktop computer, notebook, subnotebook, ultrabook, netbook, laptop:  EUR 5.00 |\n  | Hard drives as individual storage media:                                                       EUR 4.50 |\n  | External memory cards:                                                                         EUR 0.35 |\n  | Digital picture frames:                                                                        EUR 2.00 |\n  | Smartwatches:                                                                                  EUR 1.00 |</code></pre>\n\n      &gt; In some EU countries, like Austria for example, there are royalties to pay on non-volatile storage memory[1]<p>In France it&#x27;s the same but with an even more insane version. The tax is so high that it&#x27;s skewing the EU average and you have to take France out of the data.<p>As an example, taxes on mobile phones are at 14EUR for a phone with a drive greater than 64GB (so most of them nowadays)\n\n        I notice Austria an France seem to have a lot of such dumb taxes in common. I guess it must be to feed those generous welfare systems. But these taxes are basically robbing Peter to pay ... Peter.\n\n          That&#x27;s the idea yeah, the economic strategy in France is very simple: if it works then tax it, it if doesn&#x27;t work then give more subsidies.<p>That&#x27;s a terrible long term strategy because the good companies are subsidizing failing ones, destroying the reward function of the market.<p>The second terrible side effect to this policy is that the subsidies system is too complex for small companies to handle so the small companies have an increased failure rate compared to a normal economy.\n\n  Because laws are &quot;just your opinion, man&quot; and their opinion is that they violated their laws.\n\n    This seems unironically the best answer.<p>There are a lot of laws that are seemingly universal like patents, copyright, privacy (right to your own likeness etc) but the details can vary widely internationally and even between EU countries.<p>As an example: it&#x27;s infamously prohibited to commercially publish photographs taken of the Eiffel tower at night because the light installation from 1990 onward is protected by copyright law as a work of art (as is the glass pyramid of the Louvre btw). HOWEVER it&#x27;s legal to take and use pictures of permanetly publicly displayed works of art in some European countries like Austria, Germany and Switzerland (&quot;Panoramafreiheit&quot;). So you could sell post cards of unlicensed photographs of the Eiffel tower lights in those countries but not France. But if you commercially use them on a Germany-based website available in French you might still get sued from France.<p>Here&#x27;s a German map of this specific law across Europe to illustrate the point. You don&#x27;t have to speak German to understand that the laws vary wildly despite all being based in copyright:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parismalanders.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;Panoramafreiheit-Europa.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parismalanders.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;Pa...</a><p>It&#x27;s easy to see how one could argue that using copyrighted data as &quot;training material&quot; for a commercial LLM is commercial use. It&#x27;s also easy to see how one could argue that this is not &quot;reproduction&quot; of significant portions of the copyrighted work and therefore copyright law does not apply. But it&#x27;s also easy to see how one could argue that this still qualifies as &quot;citation&quot; the way Google regurgitates snippets from news sites and is thus covered by the &quot;citation&quot; provision for protecting newspapers. But it&#x27;s also easy to see how one could argue that&#x27;s not the case. Different jurisdictions will interpret these things differently.\n\nThis does nothing for real people, it&#x27;s just big companies fighting to get money while doing as little as possible. It would be much better to see a crackdown on all the harmful stuff big tech does to individuals rather than use public resources to shift around who benefits from rent seeking.\n\nInteresting, the title should probably be changed to something more related to them being fined for training on copyrighted data.<p>That&#x27;s the more interesting part here, they&#x27;ve essentially banned developing ai in France with this (though maybe they just won&#x27;t go after their own ai companies).\n\n  Developing AI with news articles. It doesn&#x27;t stop you from e.g. licensing reddit data and training on that.<p>And it&#x27;s unclear if other companies would actually run afoul of this at all, or whether this is just applicable because of the terms Google agreed to in the 2022 settlement about using news articles in their search engine. For a settlement agreement to make sense at all they obviously had to agree to stricter terms than what the regulation itself demands.\n\n    &gt;Developing AI with news articles. It doesn&#x27;t stop you from e.g. licensing reddit data and training on that.<p>Good luck competing with AI that were able to train on all data instead of just a small subset.<p>Japan has already codified it into law, I expect if other countries pile in on calling it a violation of copyright, many will set up an entity there.\n\n    A few large media companies own the copyright on the majority of news articles. AI companies can just pay to license the content (or give an equity stake in exchange).\n\n  Anyone is welcome to pay a publication or an author (for books&#x2F;magazines etc) in order to use their data for training. Companies are also welcome to request consent from individuals to use their online posts for this purpose.<p>Otherwise, what OpenAI&#x2F;Gemini are doing is, simply put, &quot;theft&quot;.\n\n    In France. So the AI winners won’t come from France, although some participants will certainly be French contributing their talents abroad.\n\n  &gt; they&#x27;ve essentially banned developing ai in France<p>This is hyperbole. Intellectual property laws have existed longer than AI, they&#x27;re being enforced on AI companies. These companies can pay to use the data, just like I would have to pay for server time with those same companies. They are richer than some countries, not students experimenting in a basement.<p>And don&#x27;t give me the &quot;nobody lost anything&quot; bullshit argument. I pirate heavily myself but I&#x27;m not a hypocrite pretending that I&#x27;m not taking something I should&#x27;ve paid for.\n\n“Which way the wind will blow” — as if it ever blew in the direction of ripping people off. Google still says you can’t use their ML stuff for anything related to ML, which smells like a noncompete foisted on customers.\n\nI&#x27;m in two minds with these kinds of fines (maybe not super relevant for this specific fine).<p>1. Do these big megacorps just not care about rules, and they look at fines as a cost of doing business while the steam roll through industries.<p>2. Have lawmakers completely failed for the past decades to effectively referee tech, and so instead of having sane regulation and clear rules everything has to get decided in courts with fines.<p>Probably both are true, and the real losers are small businesses trying to get started.\n\n  The laws around training an LLM on publicly accessible IP have never been developed and haven&#x27;t been developed, so the judge has to decide from common law. It&#x27;s the same issue as crypto &lt;&gt; SEC. Companies ask lawmakers to set the rules, but they drag their feet, they release their products, and end up getting sued.<p>It has been decided already in more technically knowledgeable countries that training on data is not the same as copying the data. It&#x27;s obvious if you understand the concept of data compression, but judges don&#x27;t always see it that way.\n\n    Or that we already train humans on copyrighted data and then employ that human intelligence for commercial use.<p>You can argue that AI is a categorically different scale that requires special regulation to protect our societal values (and I think I do) but that is a different claim and implementation than copyright enforcement.\n\n      It should be viewed as derivarive work. It equally applies to humans. It shouldn&#x27;t be classified as fair use because the works have been used in whole to train the model.<p>&#x27;A &quot;derivative work&quot; is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.&#x27;<p>(US Copyright Act of 1976)\n\n        You’re saying after a student learns physics from a copyrighted textbook they have to pay the textbook publisher royalties to work as a physicist?\n\nI&#x27;m French. It&#x27;s important to understand that France has been very bitter about missing the tech train with its failed &quot;Minitel.&quot; And since, instead of making necessary changes to become more business-friendly and technologically relevant, they&#x27;ve just remained bitter and try to tax&#x2F;punish US giants any way they can.<p>Thus, instead of becoming the type of places where the next Google or OpenAI could be incorporated, they&#x27;re promoting the brand of a country that loves playing the Robinhood for its corporate friends in the newspaper business. I get the logic of the fine, and it&#x27;s also sad to see them be proud of fining these foreign companies, instead of actually doing anything to change the fact that the country is becoming increasingly irrelevant in the modern technological age.\n\n  How does this statement square with the existence of Mistrel AI?\n\n    I doubt they&#x27;ll be able to survive in the long term to be honest.<p>They&#x27;ll either be forced to cooperate with the slow IT movers megacorps like Orange or Capgemini or buried in the legal framework by the copyright mafias. (Or a mix of both)<p>I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong of course but I know too much how it works there to be optimistic.\n\n  punishing tech giants for breaking the laws can be done regardless of creating a better less bureaucratic tech environment in france. Why you are trying to correlate both? Tbh I think the fine for google for this case is too small.\n\nWhat does this really accomplish, will the newspapers get any of that money or will it just be thrown into country&#x27;s budget pot, as a side effect alienating France further from possible tech investments? The French Google office is tiny for such a big country, at some point it&#x27;s just not worth to navigate these political waters I assume.\n\n  &gt;&gt; The French Google office is tiny for such a big country,<p>And that may be part of the issue. Milking billions and having a postal box as office doesn’t look good for the government.\n\n€250M is a rounding error for Google.  It won&#x27;t change how they are doing business.\n\nit is interesting to see for which parties these actions are taken on. they appear more like the protectionist actions that governments take in other business domains.\n\nI can&#x27;t help but wonder if AI companies are another example of &quot;regulatory entrepreneurship&quot; where things go great until the law catches up."

Yes, including Tesla ! Their car business is at the point where they may start loosing money again - competition, slowdown in EV subsides, but also factors that allowed them to reach an apparent profitability - for example, their service is nonexistent, while it used to be great.

It feels like it will eternally be 90% there but never actually reach the end goal of completely autonomy.<p>Personally I love Autopilot even if I only use it to drive on the freeways for me when I&#x27;m tired.\n\n            I think everybody understand that Musk (and others) were way to aggressive on self driving stuff. What their new version can do is impressive, but as you say, Robotaxi aren&#x27;t all that close.<p>But do think saying this demo is fake based on to aggressive timelines for self driving is a stretch.\n\n              No, they were unequivocal lies. In 2019:“ I think we will be feature-complete full self-driving this year, meaning the car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention — this year. I would say that I am certain of that. That is not a question mark.&quot; [1].<p>See the part where he says: &quot;That is not a question mark.&quot; That is called making a clear and direct, unequivocal, unqualified, statement that he knew for certain was wrong. That is called lying.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;elon-musk-doubles-down-on-claim-about-self-driving-tech-2019-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;elon-musk-doubles-down-on-cl...</a>\n\n                Not if he believed what he was saying, which is about intent, and impossible to prove.  It is rather a lot easier to make unfounded claims about someone&#x27;s intention than it is to engineer self-driving cars, reusable rockets, high resolution BCIs, world wide space internet, and faster lighter cheaper underground tunnel boring machines, let alone all of them at once.<p>Thank the stars someone is not judging you so harshly.\n\n                  Good thing the most stringent generally accepted burden of proof for intent is “beyond a reasonable doubt”, not “100% mathematically certain”.<p>In his situation, no sane person of even average intelligence would have any cause to believe that Tesla would have autonomous vehicles by the end of the year.<p>At the time the statement was made, 5 years after Tesla began development, Tesla had not even <i>begun</i> testing with no driver. It has been 5 years since then and FSD is still 10,000x worse than human drivers and they have still not even <i>begun</i> testing with no driver.<p>He was lying beyond any reasonable doubt.<p>As to your laundry list of marketing slide bullet points. Can you please identify how a list of claimed accomplishments proves a unrelated statement is not a lie?<p>I can see how it could prove someone is a habitual liar since Elon Musk has not delivered safer-than-human “self-driving cars”, “cheaper underground tunnel boring machines”, or “high resolution BCIs” so half of your supporting statements are outright fabrications that you made zero effort to validate before repeating.<p>If that is the standard of proof you apply, then I would thank the stars if people would judge me as uncritically. I could make up any fantasy and people would eat it up because how could they know I am lying, maybe I am just a colossal moron, but also a genius visionary.\n\n                    &gt; In his situation, no sane person of even average intelligence would have any cause to believe that Tesla would have autonomous vehicles by the end of the year.<p>You literally have no idea what work he&#x27;s exposed to from his engineering teams, and you have become the thing you hate by making authoritative sounding statements about subjects which you cannot know everything.<p>If you can&#x27;t prevent yourself from making such statements, I&#x27;m not sure how you expect anyone else to.<p>qed\n\n                      Thank you for resorting to ad hominem, it shows you have run out of real arguments. But it is sad to see that you can not even resort to ad hominem without making logical fallacies.<p>In case you did not notice, it is Elon Musk who made the unequivocal, unqualified, direct, positive assertion that the cars would be self-driving by end of 2019. That demands clear and convincing evidence. To assert the absence of clear and convincing, as I have done, only demands establishing it is unclear or unconvincing, it does not reverse the standard to require me to prove the negative in a clear and convincing manner. You have failed to even apply to basic standards of burdens of proof as is commonly seen by those parroting the pernicious lies of Elon Musk.<p>But sure, let us assume my standard of proof is clear and convincing.<p>In 2019, they had not even <i>begun</i> testing with no human driver. I will repeat that, they had not even <i>tested</i> the claim <i>at all</i> in <i>any official capacity</i>. We know this because you are required to get a driverless testing permit before you begin testing and you must publicly report any driverless testing miles. Tesla has reported 0 miles as of 2024 as they have so far failed to even receive a permit. This is because they have not even done any driverless testing with a safety driver since 2016. 5 years after &quot;That is not a question mark.&quot; they have still not even started testing.<p>In 2019, they were unable to detect and respond to &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; signs. 5 years later, they still can not detect and respond to &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; signs. You would have to be a colossal moron to believe the car will be better than a human driver when it still can not even handle the, what, 5th most common road sign? The road sign that tells you not to drive down a dangerous street. No normal person would believe the car will be ready within 1 year if it can not even handle common road signs and has been completely untested.<p>As to what he is exposed to from his engineering teams. We know from sworn testimony by the, now current director of Autopilot, that Elon Musk was made aware that the 2016 Autonomy Day demo introducing their self-driving system was done over multiple takes, using technology they have repeatedly declared they will not use in production products (such as HD mapping), and literally crashed during at least one of the takes [1]. Despite this, he still directed the initial frame of the video to state: &quot;The person in the driver&#x27;s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.&quot; That is direct and clear deception  meant to insinuate the system is ready when the engineers directly and clearly indicate that it is not. Elon Musk demonstrably, literally, has a past record on this exact topic of being intentionally deceptive.<p>As to your statement that I, &quot;literally have no idea what work he&#x27;s exposed to&quot;, turns out I actually do know, so you are wrong on that as well. I actually have mutual friends with one of the former heads of Autopilot in the mid 2010s who repeatedly told Elon Musk that the systems were not ready. Despite that, Elon Musk announced that it would be safer than a human driver on a schedule that the engineers said was impossible (which we now know to be correct as they still can not do it nearly a decade after that deadline). He then fired the team when they failed to do the impossible. Then he fired the next team when they failed to deliver on his promises. Then he fired the next team. Then he fired the next team. Then I think he hired Karpathy, though maybe there were a few more firings in between that. Then he fired that team. Then I think he promoted the loyalist who helped make the deceiving 2016 demo.<p>He fired like half a dozen teams because they could not meet his insane deadlines showing that his promises were not based in what he learned from his engineering team, but lies in the hopes that a miracle would happen and make his lies into truth. I have not read his biography, but I have been told that this process of: &quot;Promise it is almost ready. Relentlessly drive engineering team. Fail to meet deadline. Fire team so you now have nothing working. Promise the thing that was not working is now almost ready.&quot; is well documented.<p>So yeah. Your arguments consist entirely of logical fallacies and even then they do not hold water.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;23574198-elluswamy-deposition-transcript\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;23574198-elluswamy-d...</a>\n\n                        &gt; No normal person would believe the car will be ready within 1 year if it can not even handle common road signs and has been completely untested.<p>No normal person has access to custom built supercomputers to train AIs or teams of engineers dedicated to such.  It&#x27;s a weird false equivalency to base your entire argument on and leaves me to conclude that you would feel similarly about anyone engineering something which hasn&#x27;t previously existed.<p>&gt; He fired like half a dozen teams because they could not meet his insane deadlines showing that his promises were not based in what he learned from his engineering team, but lies in the hopes that a miracle would happen and make his lies into truth. I have not read his biography, but I have been told that this process of: &quot;Promise it is almost ready. Relentlessly drive engineering team. Fail to meet deadline. Fire team so you now have nothing working. Promise the thing that was not working is now almost ready.&quot; is well documented.<p>If the man wasn&#x27;t landing rockets, forcing the auto industry to electrify after even California failed to do so, connecting the world with Starlink, and allowing paralyzed people to live more fulfilling lives, you might have an argument?  Whatever he&#x27;s doing seems to work.  Seems like a lot of problems just need management that believes the problem can be solved with enough investment and effort.<p>&quot;In Australia and New Zealand, tall poppy syndrome refers to successful people being criticised. This occurs when their peers believe they are too successful, or are bragging about their success.[1][2] Intense scrutiny and criticism of such a person is termed as &quot;cutting down the tall poppy&quot;.&quot;<p>From <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tall_poppy_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tall_poppy_syndrome</a><p>And no, it is not established that because you cited one person&#x27;s deposition and &quot;mutual friends with one of the former heads of Autopilot&quot; that you &quot;actually do know&quot;  what work Elon is exposed to from his engineering teams.  What a weird claim to make when you&#x27;re not sitting in on the meetings yourself.<p>I find the thousands of hours of RE work done by <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@MunroLive\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@MunroLive</a> to be a much more credible indicator of the kind of thinking and work that goes on at Tesla.\n\n                          Your argument is that Elon Musk knows something we do not about how fast they are improving which is why every single year for a literal decade he has promised a unsupervised self driving system and every single year for that decade he has a produced a unsupervised self driving system that can not even read basic road signs, is 10,000x worse than a human driver, has not even begun validation, and that has killed tens to hundreds of people. Your argument flies in the face of reality. He is demonstrably unable to predict progress by literal factors of thousands and yet makes unequivocal statements that it will be completed in timelines that would be impossible even if the product were literally already done and only validation was required.<p>And again you go to irrelevant arguments. Are you saying that it is okay to lie aggressively just because you happen to get it right in unrelated fields? Because as we see, he is totally and utterly wrong on his self-driving promises. But that is okay because he lies all the time and sometimes it works out? Who cares about the lying as long as we electrify the auto industry. Oh, should we also overlook all the ridiculous racism in the factories as well? And all those people they killed for no reason are just fertilizer for a glorious future, they should be glad that they could be sacrificed.<p>At this point I am bored of this thread since I have already made my point and all you do is present the bad faith and irrelevant PR bullet points parroted by the Elon Musk cult. Anybody who is actually reading this thread should see how fallacious and morally bankrupt that position is so I am done here. Have fun.\n\n                            Bored and pissed off at successful people is a rough way to live life, buddy.  I feel for you.  I know hating on Elon is the popular thing to be doing these days, but you don&#x27;t have to demonize folks you don&#x27;t agree with.  I happen to appreciate the work each of his companies are doing.  I appreciate the level of engineering knowledge apparent in discussions with him, which in my experience is unusual at the management level.  No one else out there is building Starship - Jeff Bezos and NASA included.  And my appreciation for all these things stems from a multidisciplinary understandin of the complexity of the engineering and organizational and economic efforts involved in making a Mars shot not only viable but profitable and sustainable.  Elon has absolutely done things I don&#x27;t agree with - everyone has - that just doesn&#x27;t prevent me from appreciating the things he invests his time and effort and resources into doing, when he doesn&#x27;t need to.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that autopilot hasn&#x27;t worked out as quickly as Musk had hoped.  But I also find myself forced in the same breath to acknowledge that Tesla has made a great deal of progress, maybe more than any other car company, at solving a problem I&#x27;ve paid attention to since the DARPA grand challenge days.<p>I think it&#x27;s wonderful to have big dreams as a society, and to reach for them, and accomplish them.  It&#x27;s inspiring.  Maybe you should take notes.  Thanks for expressing yourself.\n\n      The headline is wrong, the video was not faked (nor edited). The guy just said what was in the video was not currently shipping to customers, i.e. it was a tech demo.\n\n      That&#x27;s not faked though.. according to your link they tried multiple times and only showed the success video. But the statement that the software drove with no intervention was accurate, and the video was authentic.\n\n        That&#x27;s at least misleading. By that standard, the current video wouldn&#x27;t be fake if the subject were primarily operating his computer through eye-tracking software, since no explicit representations were made about the mechanism of control.\n\n        The link says that the route was pre-determined, pre-mapped, tried multiple times and crashed once during the trials.<p>By the same logic, this video would not be faked even if in fact it&#x27;s the same chess move he tried for 2 months and it&#x27;s the only one working, and also another patient died.<p>Not saying it&#x27;s the case - clearly not. But yeah, let&#x27;s be real.\n\n          This was live streamed\n\n        How about that time they claimed the Cybertruck beats a Porsche in a 1&#x2F;4 mile race, but they only did a 1&#x2F;8 mile race and then just made up a 1&#x2F;4 mile time based on their feelings? [1]<p>Or that time they lied about 120,000 defective suspensions that broke causing crashes and fatalities and then blamed their customers and covered it up so they would not have to issue a recall in the US (they were forced to issue a recall for the issue in China)? [2]<p>A decade of unequivocal lies about delivering autonomous vehicles [3] while knowingly killing tens to hundreds.<p>But other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HRYS5VWXZts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HRYS5VWXZts</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;investigates&#x2F;special-report&#x2F;tesla-musk-steering-suspension&#x2F;#:~:text=Failures%20of%20aft%20links%20were,raised%20warranty%20expenses%20for%20Tesla\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;investigates&#x2F;special-report&#x2F;tesla-mu...</a>.<p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawnproject.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;Elon-Musk-Broken-Promises-2024.mp4?_=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawnproject.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;Elon-Musk...</a>\n\n  Speculative mud slinging\n\n    You reap what you sow\n\n  Exactly my thoughts, unfortunately.<p>But giving it the benefit of the doubt, this looks mind blowing to me !<p>It was kind of known that the research and tech is almost there for a while already, but seeing the demonstration live like that - incredible !<p>But then it takes me back to those Musk companies - maybe it&#x27;s just a repackaged already available research presented in a nice way - making us believe it could be &#x27;deployed&#x27; in real world, while in reality it can only be done in a very controlled environment. And we are led to believe that we are &#x27;2 weeks away&#x27; from it being widely available. Hope we&#x27;re wrong here.\n\n    The resulting brain infection will quit literally be mind blowing\n\n  Rather surprised at how many are taking this at face value, given the track record.\n\nI haven&#x27;t followed Neuralink too closely since it was announced, so I was not expecting to see what I just saw. I&#x27;ve seen a handful of breakthrough moments in my life - I think this will be remembered as one.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think the device itself is a breakthrough, the issue beforehand was that tissue in the brain tries to heal from the implant, it can be lethal, I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing to have a PERMANENT implant, completely stop that area from &quot;healing&quot; so tht the implant doesn&#x27;t become a legitimate hazard.\n\n    The main issues with previous BCIs were that the electrodes were larger, less flexible, and not as biocompatible. This caused scar tissue to form around the electrodes, degrading the quality of the signals and eventually making the device useless. Neuralink has apparently reduced scar tissue formation enough that the implant receives usable signals for years. Neuralink also uses far more electrodes, improving signal quality and adding redundancy. The number of electrodes necessitates the use of a robot to place them. The robot is programmed to avoid blood vessels, which also reduces bleeding and scarring.<p>It will be quite a while before we know if they&#x27;ve managed to mitigate the issues enough to last a lifetime (and support upgrades), but it&#x27;s better than previous devices.\n\n      Can you point to a study showing that Neuralink has achieved any of those things you mentioned? What evidence is there that the implants have reduced scar tissue formation and what supports the assertion that they would be usable for years? What other previous devices are you comparing it to that allows you to positively assert that it is better than them?<p>You can not just reel off every bullet point on the marketing slides without support as if it is the truth.\n\n        the only development (and it wasnt invented by neuralink) is flexible and smaller electrodes seem to take longer for scarring to take over than larger and more rigid ones.  Right now, it seems that their only path is to help people with severe disabilities get better quality of life for a few years, which many people might take.\n\n          I&#x27;ve worked with Deep Brain Stimulation and other cranial implants before. Mostly on the hardware side and the implantation side.<p>I want to stress that giving a person a few years is a <i>big</i> deal. It&#x27;s not something to scoff at. Even a few months can really help someone out.\n\n  Why would this be remembered as a breakthrough? Playing games with a BCI is many years old at this point. Here is an article from 2020 talking about playing Sonic the Hedgehog, amongst other games [1]. Here he is fist bumping <i>President Obama</i> in 2016 with a brain controlled robot arm.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;video-games&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;brain-computer-gaming&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;video-games&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;brain-...</a>\n\n    Yeah game&#x2F;simulator control by neural interface is <i>old</i> news (and has been demonstrated with non-invasive interfaces.)<p>[2015] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;smart-news&#x2F;paralyzed-woman-operated-flight-simulator-using-only-her-thoughts-180954469&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;smart-news&#x2F;paralyzed-woman-op...</a><p>[2013] With a non-invasive interface: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1741-2560&#x2F;10&#x2F;4&#x2F;046003\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1741-2560&#x2F;10&#x2F;4&#x2F;04...</a><p>[2011] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0026322\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal...</a><p>[2010] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;20876032&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;20876032&#x2F;</a>\n\nIt is fascinating. But looking at this guy condition, playing games would be IMHO not the prio. I would hook up the remote controlling to a robotic exoskeleton, for just be back and function normal. I guess that also can be detected  ( intention to move feet or hands in any direction ).<p>But let&#x27;s see, we are really at the beginning.\n\n  Well I don&#x27;t think those exoskeletons even really exist yet.  So baby steps.\n\n  Of course, but that’s going to take so much more time and effort. You can see how much joy this man is in just having the autonomy to move a mouse again. That’s honestly amazing.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think it can simultaneously control the dozens of degrees of freedom that a robot would have. Yet. You only need three degrees of freedom for a mouse with button. That alone is transformational for a quadriplegic.\n\n  there is good works done in this article:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-023-06094-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-023-06094-5</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cea.fr&#x2F;english&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;News&#x2F;brain-computer-interface-enables-thought-controlled-walking-after-spinal-cord-injury.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cea.fr&#x2F;english&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;News&#x2F;brain-computer-interfa...</a>\n\n  Better than an exoskeleton is a second implant below his C4&#x2F;5 to reconnect his spinal chord with his brain via wifi.\n\n    That is very likely neuralink’s plan<p>IIRC they are doing that test in pigs right now\n\n    Neurolink has already said that this is the plan. This is one of the first steps.<p>They are solving the easiest things first of course\n\n  Your idea is that the priority should have been, instead of first getting a mouse working on his laptop, to hook him up to some kind of robotic exoskeleton?\n\nThe sheer joy on this mans face to be able to freely control a mouse again, and engage with general technology. If they’re able to make this into a generally safe procedure, a lot of people will be interested in just that.\n\nI love that one of the first things he said he did was binge on Civilization 6 until 6am. Welcome back, buddy!<p>Strangely that simple example was the most powerful part for me. I&#x27;ve done that so many times and it was such a fun experience. Now he gets to re-live that joy (and follow up shame) again!\n\nI&#x27;m curious if he&#x27;s signed any type of NDA or non-disparagement agreement to receive the implant.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d have to do that - the implant could simply prevent any disparaging output.\n\n    Har har.\n\n  They probably interviewed him to see if he’d be a good person for PR reasons. And I imagine he got it for free. So he has plenty to be happy about with the situation\n\n    I&#x27;d rather hear about his own experiences from the man himself, without someone from Neuralink standing over him and hyping it for a press release.\n\n      He’s on twitter expressing his own opinion all the time\n\n        Hence why I&#x27;m asking if he signed an NDA or non-disparagement agreement.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, moving a mouse with your mind isn&#x27;t entirely new: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elifesciences.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;18554\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elifesciences.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;18554</a><p>Personally, I think the most exciting part of Neuralink and other companies working on BCIs is the fact that they&#x27;re trying to keep these implants in long-term, and scale the deployment significantly. Most academic BCI research thus far has just been trials, without patients getting to keep the implants long term.\n\n  Moving the mouse wasn&#x27;t that impressive. That he could turn of the music just like that while the game was open was impressive. And Civ 6 is way more complex to operate compared to chess. I assume that&#x27;s not mouse driven.<p>Still early days for this tech but it seems impressive.\n\n    Civ 6 can be entirely played via mouse\n\n    &gt; And Civ 6 is way more complex to operate compared to chess. I assume that’s not mouse driven.<p>Civ 6 is drivable completely with the mouse, and other than editing gold amounts in trade offers a little more quickly there’s not much reason to use anything but a mouse for it.\n\n  I assume moving the mouse is an intermediary step for the short term. Detecting intents and relating to actions is probably the medium term goal.\n\nAs soon as you can stimulate tactile impressions it&#x27;s over. You can put on your VR Headset and be in a completely different world. Eventually the interface for eyes and ears will improve, but tactility would be a huge step towards being in a completely virtual world.\n\n  I think at that point you could also stimulate visual&#x2F;audio cortex as well - no headset needed!\n\n    It&#x27;s going to take a long time to match the inbound bandwidth of the optic nerves. Lots of specialized cells involved.

In the book, there was a Hitler-esque villain who existed long before the characters were born. The villain killed many billions of people. But through cloning, the societies of Earth punish this villain for their entire life by feeding them torturous scenarios through their brain implants. These were scenarios like being chased and eaten by a tiger, running naked through a frozen tundra, execution, etc.<p>The clone thought it was entirely real because it was all in their brain implant, even though they were safe in a jail cell. And as an extra Black Mirror-y twist, anyone in that society could tune in with their own implant to watch the clone being tortured.<p>I’m not really trying to cast doom and gloom on this brain implant tech, I think it’s neat. I was just reminded of the book I read when you mentioned simulating tactile impressions and virtual worlds. Pleasant simulations would be great, but even “benignly” scary ones like a virtual haunted house in your brain could be terrifying. (As someone who hates haunted houses.)\n\n  VR headsets have spent many years being not terribly good. I imagine the first tactile impressions will be similar.\n\nThis makes me very excited! I have Spinal Muscular Atrophy type 2 [1] and I have lost most of my physical capabilities save for 2-3 fingers and of course speech. Although I am now on Nusinersen [2] treatments I am still becoming weaker over time, albeit extremely slowly.<p>It brings me comfort to know that such a fallback will eventually exist, should I need one.<p>Note that specialists are saying that another promising drug from Scholar Rock [3] would probably prevent any further weakening if used in conjunction with my current treatment. Unfortunately, the FDA takes a long time to approve new medications and I have heard this one is particularly special because there is potential for abuse by athletes.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spinal_muscular_atrophy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spinal_muscular_atrophy</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nusinersen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nusinersen</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholarrock.com&#x2F;our-pipeline&#x2F;spinal-muscular-atrophy&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholarrock.com&#x2F;our-pipeline&#x2F;spinal-muscular-atrophy...</a>\n\n  I hope you can get on that promising drug ASAP and that it works wonders. I think the future looks bright for medicine with all these new breakthroughs coming out.\n\n  I‘ve been wondering if Apple‘s AR Headset would be a useful tool for people in similar situations. Did you have a chance to try it, yet?\n\n    Doesn&#x27;t that headset require you to be able to move your head in various directions, and be able to use gestures and such? I just looked at some videos during the release, and those things seems to be a pretty fundamental part of using it.\n\n      You don&#x27;t necessarily need to move anything other than eyes. It&#x27;s the default input method, but it doesn&#x27;t require it. It&#x27;s a computer, it can connect to other devices or use APIs.\n\n        So if you use a headset meant for spatial movements, but you&#x27;re unable to do spatial movements, can&#x27;t you just use a display and get exactly the same experience?\n\n          It&#x27;s not the same experience. Display is never going to give you full immersion.<p>Not saying which is better - it&#x27;s certainly different though.\n\n          A very close experience yes. It works just fine with zero head movement and you can move and adjust your windows to only be directly in front of you. And they are by default\n\n      From what I understand the headset can be configured to be used without moving the head and even to use eye tracking, only, instead of the minimal finger gestures.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;guide&#x2F;apple-vision-pro&#x2F;tan426c48bdc&#x2F;visionos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;guide&#x2F;apple-vision-pro&#x2F;tan42...</a>\n\n&gt; &quot;I played Civ 6 until 6AM&quot;<p>Neuralink has now achieved product market fit\n\n  I never could get into Civ. Do you have any tutorials or a specific game edition to recommend? Maybe my issue is that it&#x27;s too slow to get started with, but it seems like I&#x27;d enjoy it if I stuck with it.\n\n    You either like it or you don’t. The inbuilt tutorial is pretty self explanatory and took me 15 mins to really get into it from scratch. It’s slow and turn based and that’s not for everyone.<p>Factorio on the other hand took a while for me to start liking but that’s because it has a huge learning curve. I eventually got into it but it’s not something I crave playing.\n\n      Hmm, I&#x27;ll power through, thanks. I do love Factorio, though.\n\n    Not a big Civ fan. I had way more fun with Paradox games like Crusader Kings. You can learn them by watching a Let&#x27;s Play on YT. After watching a few hours of somebody play in a roll play fashion, I jumped in.\n\n    Fwiw I liked Civ 5 more, maybe give that one a go over Civ 6 if you haven&#x27;t.\n\n    The open source clone of 5&#x2F;6 is pretty fast, games take less time when it&#x27;s less flashy and more responsive:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yairm210&#x2F;Unciv\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yairm210&#x2F;Unciv</a>\n\n      This is much more convenient than the full game, but I always get stuck in the tutorial because I can&#x27;t find a button it asks me to press :(\n\n      Why do you say “5&#x2F;6”? its an open-source clone of 5, and the Readme notes that given the time it took them to get done with 5 (i.e., not yet, as the base mechanics are only “mostly done” and there’s a bunch of stuff from the expansions still to do), implementing Civ 6 mechanics is an express “won’t-do”.\n\n    Play civ 2 first. The newer civs have so much extra stuff to make it overwhelming.\n\n      Ahh, that&#x27;s a good idea, thanks!\n\n    For me Civ 5 is brilliant (even more so with the improved AI mods), Civ 6 feels like a chore.\n\nSome clarity for ppl. \n- Other techniques would likely work for this patient. Eyegaze technology is pretty readily available. He has proximity switches for driving his chair and lets not forget voice control. So.. what does BCIe offer significantly? I think this is the BIG problem BCI has. The gains are not  enough for a lot of people compared to what the AT sector can already offer. Please remember this. This guy could use eyegaze or voice control on pretty regular hardware. And no surgery needed..<p>- These types of BCI are effectively an array of switches. You typically map a motor thought eg. &quot;Move your arm up&quot; =&gt; Moving the cursor up. This maybe how then you control a game such as chess if it has keyboard shortcuts. Eye movement could be done in the same way but there are easier ways. Interestingly to measure these motor commands you dont really need intracortical BCI. You can do it with surface EEG. Sticking it inside your head - closer to centres where you can measure intentional thought makes the signal cleaner and more reliable<p>- The big breakthroughs is really making this intracortical stuff safer and long term. Its getting there. But this isnt it<p>The big wins out there - are in speech BCI. Thats hardcore. Even the two main studies doing this - each of the participants requires a LOT of training time to make a Machine model work efficiently.\n\n  They are taking an iterative approach.<p>Look at the starship program for an example of where you can get in 20 iterations\n\n  I think once this tech can be used to connect to a robot &#x2F; exoskeleton, then it will be very useful for someone like him. Imagine him thinking that he wants an apple from the fridge in another room and the robot goes and grabs it for him.\n\n    Yeah I agree. In reality though - right now - I&#x27;d say you might be surprised to what people actually want and need. For example  I could assess someone for say a curtain opener or door opener. I have fallen into the trap of assuming that someone would want this. In reality though its very few people who do. Why? Its totally overkill and pointless when 90% they are with someone who will just open the door anyway. (NB: This isnt Everyone - the ubiquity of home control systems on the regular commercial marketplace is changing this I think)\n\n  Sorry but what you&#x27;re saying simply is not true from my experience. The potential of this technology is the ability to perform multiple actions simultaneously e.g. having your character strafe while zooming in while firing a trigger. With eye tracking you are limited to (for the most part) one action at a time, which is what I do now.<p>You are correct in that one could add more inputs but that only works if you can use the inputs. The individual in the video has full control of his head which many people do not. All I can do, for example, is use like two fingers.\n\n  &gt; You can do it with surface EEG.  sticking it inside your head - closer to centres where you can measure intentional and thought makes vy signal cleaner and more reliable.<p>Further clarification:  when doing conventional EEG,  the signal quality is so fragile that even blinking can produce recording artifact.<p>Also,  there&#x27;s the whole &quot;put a shower cap with conductive gel&quot;  things that makes it very impractical for every day use.\n\n    There are &#x27;dry&#x27; EEG electrodes which don&#x27;t require conductive gel, and algorithms to remove the electrical effect of eye-blinks (ICA, etc.)\n\n    You don&#x27;t need a full EEG to do what the parent mentions. 3 electrodes around each eye (EOG) + ground is all that is needed. Even cheap commercial electrodes will work for this. Blinks can be filtered online with PCA-like techniques.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think the point for him was to simply find a way to control his mouse. He said at the end of the clip he specifically wanted to help out with Neuralink. He also said the surgery was easy and he was released a day later.<p>He appears to just think about where the mouse should go and then be able to click and click-and-hold. Seems like multiple inputs which an eye tracker wouldn&#x27;t do. Unless maybe its just configured to click when the cursor pauses on a spot?<p>Also the user experience seems better than attaching electrodes to your head. It seems to just work wirelessly. It is always there and sometimes he has to recharge it.\n\n    Theres a lot of patients who &quot;want to help out&quot; Eddie Chang&#x27;s team in SF have one patient who moved right next to the hospital to equally do this.. (NB: they should be getting paid too by the way - although thats not clear)<p>Yeah - this is wireless. Better than some systems which have been, no joke, a box at the top of your head with a HDMI cable in it..<p>&gt; He appears to just think about where the mouse should go and then be able to click and click-and-hold. Seems like multiple inputs which an eye tracker wouldn&#x27;t do. Unless maybe its just configured to click when the cursor pauses on a spot?<p>This is really the key question. The dwell technique you note is what most eyetrackers do (although far better to use a binary technique - eg a blink - to select because of the midas touch effect). Its built into to Windows&#x2F;MacOS and iOS now. I have a sneaky feeling the reason why its chess is you can encode the positions &quot;X1 to Y2&quot;. You can then do a transformer model to decode intentional speech..<p>If that is the case - then if a person actually speaks whats the benefit right now for this indvidual? (yes - that he doesnt have to say it. BUT sub-vocal speech is already achievable without invasive surgery..)\n\n  He notes these other forms of HCI in the video, and I think you’re really underselling the main point of this being ease of use. All of those methods are significantly degraded experiences compared to normal ways of interacting with a computer. The potential for a quadriplegic to interface with a computer at a higher ease of use compared to a human without disabilities is huge.\n\n    Sure. The problem is this video somewhat misses how that interaction actually works. You need a control technique of thinking to action.  What that actually is and how you learn to use that is missing from the demos. Thats a tad misleading right now IMHO.. (NB: It could be intentional speech eg &quot;Move x to y&quot; or it could be intentional motor control &quot;move my hand right and up&quot; You would also need a stop command. Not sure.. )<p>But sure - &quot;the potential&quot; is the key thing in all this. Just the cost to benefit ratio is pretty dramatic right now.\n\n  Eye tracking does not work nearly as well as people imagine. It cannot directly replace a mouse pointer the way you want it to. The accuracy and reliability are not good enough and never will be due to physical constraints. This system is likely already working better than an eye tracker would for cursor control, and it will certainly improve.<p>Apple has done great stuff with eye tracking on Vision Pro, but it required completely rewriting the UI for literally everything. Not something we have the luxury of doing for accessibility for quadriplegics.<p>Source: built an eye tracker and eye-controlled UI at a startup and got acquired by Google\n\n    I hear you. I literally cant use any commercial tracker because of a alternating strabismus and the midas touch effect is a nightmare. I&#x27;d argue Apple did that because its such a mess on regular OS where the primary input method isnt eye gaze. (They did that with iOS too - match the OS and UI to the primary access method)<p>I&#x27;m not sure I can believe this &quot;This system is likely already working better than an eye tracker would for cursor control&quot; - the training to use this stuff isnt just &#x27;magic&#x27;. I do agree though with &quot;and it will certainly improve&quot;  - yeah iterate.. iterate..\n\n    Eye tracking on AVP works very well on websites that are not at all designed for it.\n\n  There’s a ton more that these implants can do other than cursor control. And not needing external visible hardware like other forms of input is a bigger deal than you might think, and especially in terms of the user wanting to feel more “normal” and less of a robot in a bundle of contraptions\n\n  He explicitly mentions eye tracking and how it doesn&#x27;t work for him in this interview with him: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ModdedQuad&#x2F;status&#x2F;1771298116719002100\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ModdedQuad&#x2F;status&#x2F;1771298116719002100</a>\n\nA key differentiator of Neuralink is that the implant can both read and write through ~1000 channels (each of which is a tiny wire into the brain). So it&#x27;s not really the same thing as external devices that read electrical activity from outside the brain, because those cannot write data. Not sure if the initial implant supports much of this, obviously you&#x27;d start with the simplest use cases.\n\n  Which is why I will never get anything like that installed unless I&#x27;m paralyzed or effectively so.  Humans have no mechanism for recognizing that a sensation, thought, or emotion, which arises within themselves, is actually inserted by malware. No thanks.\n\n    I&#x27;d just wait like a decade and see how it&#x27;s going.\n\nThe inspiration for this (as well as for SpaceX) comes from the “Culture” series of novels by Iain M. Banks, which most people are apparently unfamiliar with. Specifically the BCI interface is called “neural lace” there and it grows along with the brain from a seed and covers its entire surface. There it serves as an interface to access superhuman AIs and information in general, on demand, and only the hopeless luddites choose not to have it\n\n  Sorry but surely the idea of having a brain computer interface predates the Culture novels by many decades. Similarly, how are these books the inspiration for SpaceX? Those ideas of traveling the stars (well, planets) _absolutely_ predate the culture series.<p>Seems pretty obvious to me that these ideas originated long ago in the scientific world and were (beautifully) expanded upon by science fiction authors (again, many decades ago).\n\n    The names of SpaceX’s drone ships, such as “Of Course I Still Love You”, are from the Culture novels\n\n      Oh so grand parent was referring to the names?\n\n    Not the idea itself, but this specific implementation. Musk has clearly read quite a bit of Banks and Heinlein.\n\n      That’s fair I suppose but it’s probably giving more credit to Musk than he deserves. The real work is all being done by researchers who are drastically more knowledgeable about all of this than he is. He’s wise to invest in these sorts of ideas though and deserves credit for that.\n\n        Yeah those researchers would be aimlessly rotting in academia if he didn’t fund risky, out there stuff like this. I can’t name anyone else among his peers who spends their wealth on anything even remotely civilizationally beneficial.\n\n          Okay.\n\n          &gt;Would be rotting in academia<p>They’d be doing research man\n\n            They _are_ doing research man, and they get help from the best engineers on the planet to turn that research into reality. That’s much better than poking mice brains and never getting anything done. Here they get EEs, roboticists, computer vision experts, neurosurgeons, you name it.\n\n        I think he deserves an awful lot of credit for funding such a pie in th sky idea and giving those researches a chance to even attempt it.<p>In 1 month he&#x27;s launched the largest rocket ever, done one of the first successful brain implants ever and released a pretty amazing version of FSD.<p>No other billionaires have done even 1 of those things. Even if he was a buffoon he deserves credit foe the audacity.\n\n          I was sort of with you until the FSD\n\n            The new FSD is fantastic. It&#x27;s not perfect but 12.3 is a  massive upgrade over 11.x. Very natural. The end is within sight, really.\n\n              IDK. I tried previous versions others said were “fantastic” and it was a pants-shitting experience every time, so I quickly turned it off. Plus I had to hold onto the steering wheel the entire time. That’s not “self driving” IMO\n\n                Version 12 is a quantum leap above version 11. It&#x27;s not even comparable. V11 was just bad imo\n\n                  Maybe I’ll give it another try. Do you still have to keep your hands on the steering wheel?\n\nIs it EEG? or any other tech?\n\nAlmost out of the loop about Neuralink&#x27;s tech. Is it EEG?\n\n  It&#x27;s previously involved neural implantation in animals. The video doesn&#x27;t make it clear what&#x27;s going on, here.\n\n  not exactly it is a bunch of wires measuring differential voltages inside the brain not on surface of the skull. So you get a much better specificity in the signals (think of it as resolution). even if you out 1000 probes on a skull you wouldn&#x27;t get much information.\n\nEvery possible breakthrough is now a demo on Twitter without much technical context.\n\nI’ll believe this when it’s independently verified.\n\nI want to know how big the GPU crunching all the numbers is to make this work...<p>The mouse seems to move very nicely and smoothly (60 FPS?) which presumably means the neural net which converts raw sensor data to mouse movements is running in ~15 milliseconds.<p>Most neural nets don&#x27;t do a forward pass in 15ms unless they&#x27;re either tiny or the GPU is very powerful.\n\nI&#x27;d like to know if they&#x27;re doing &#x27;online training&#x27; - ie. Do the weights of the neural net which converts raw signal data into mouse movements update themselves every few seconds using historical data?<p>Such online training might be necessary to deal with brain plasticity - ie. The optimal set of neurons to read to determine X&#x2F;Y mouse movement right now might not be the same set it was an hour ago.<p>Such plasticity can be seen in regular humans too when they say &#x27;whoa, I haven&#x27;t used a pen for months - let me get used to writing again!&#x27;.\n\nThis video kinda looks like the patient really likes their new implant and it&#x27;s abilities, but is pretty frustrated they now need to do more trials&#x2F;make marketing videos for the implant when they just want to get on with their life...\n\nMusk says &quot;Blindsight is the next @Neuralink\n product after Telepathy.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s see, I think after that, the next product should be Magic Missle. Or maybe Sanctuary?\n\nOh my fauci! I can&#x27;t wait to get ads served directly into my brain"

The junction point explains the fast chargers, but the Level 2 would presumably be used primarily by locals.<p>I mean even middle of nowhere cities like Ellsworth are getting DCFC - granted at a dealership, but still it&#x27;s happening!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plugshare.com&#x2F;location&#x2F;560842\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plugshare.com&#x2F;location&#x2F;560842</a>\n\n  &gt;&gt; A good first step to the chicken and egg problem. Living in Wisconsin I have never seen an electrical charging station.<p>There are approximately 35 active Tesla Supercharger <i>stations</i> with almost 300 individual chargers in Wisconsin. (More than I would have guessed...)\n\n  They do not stand out as much as a whole gas station so it can be easy to miss charging stations. Once you start looking though, they are much more common than you might think. In any case, what matters, if you aren’t charging at home, is that you can find chargers using an app or the car’s navigation system.\n\n  Small towns have set up speed traps on highways passing nearby so much that many states have enacted laws to restrict the ability of such towns to annex land for this purpose. Since EV chargers aren&#x27;t a natural monopoly, local governments could use their power of zoning and other regulations to create an artificial monopoly for themselves over EV charging. State enterprises also have a history of being inefficient when they can lock out non-state competitors or drive those competitors out of business through state power.<p>State ownership of utilities are a mixed bag but at least they&#x27;re generally answerable to those in their service area. Due to the transient nature of vehicles needing charging, it&#x27;s not difficult to see some small towns that happen to be near road junctions setting themselves up as the only charging choice in the area. Maybe you have enough charge left to bypass pass the chargers that are 25% more expensive than the state average. Or maybe you just stop and pay it.\n\nDoes this mean Tesla charging or ... ?\n\n  Eventually it’s all NACS&#x2F;J3400 in North America, which is the “Tesla Charger” but the J1772 wire protocol and some additions to help adoption. For example, you can run two phases from commercial 480v three phase commercial power to charge at 270v.<p>As a J1772 equipped driver, I don’t mind eventually needing an adapter since I don’t personally use DC fast charging very often.\n\nI&#x27;ll note that this is part of FHWA and DOE&#x27;s Alternate Fuel Corridors program, and many states applied for and got similar grants.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fhwa.dot.gov&#x2F;environment&#x2F;alternative_fuel_corridors&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fhwa.dot.gov&#x2F;environment&#x2F;alternative_fuel_corrid...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;corridors\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;corridors</a><p>Personally, I&#x27;m glad most of the money seems to be going to electric charging stations vs hydrogen and alternate hydrocarbon fueling stations.  I would have preferred if the program had focused on installing charging stations at the ~1400 highway rest stations across the country vs giving grants to business to help them install stations.\n\n  Look where Tesla puts their Superchargers [1]. There’s a reason they go at businesses instead of rest areas. If you site them where they are at the whim of politics, your infra is in constant political&#x2F;bureaucratic peril. Businesses are incentivized to keep customers coming.<p>Tangentially, the EV chargers are always out of order at O’hare and Midway airport parking lots. The Superchargers at the nearby gas station (ORD) [2] and the Target (MDW) [3] are always available. Tesla is incentivized to offer a highly available charging network (they don’t move EVs or receive revenue from other automakers otherwise); you want folks with an incentive to provide high uptime to own and operate these stations.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supercharge.info&#x2F;map\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supercharge.info&#x2F;map</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;findus&#x2F;location&#x2F;supercharger&#x2F;chicagoiloharesupercharger\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;findus&#x2F;location&#x2F;supercharger&#x2F;chicagoil...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;findus&#x2F;location&#x2F;supercharger&#x2F;ChicagoILSupercharger\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;findus&#x2F;location&#x2F;supercharger&#x2F;ChicagoIL...</a>\n\n    &gt; where they are at the whim of politics, your infra is in constant political&#x2F;bureaucratic peril<p>Whims like this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;new-york-rest-stops-chick-fil-a-17e5a44140f0cb383fa31429bf66184b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;new-york-rest-stops-chick-fil-a-1...</a>\n\n      Distinct issue. You’re serving transport infra, you do what the landlord says or make way for another business that will.

TIL! Thanks! Something I will add to my list when chasing after congresspeople for other policy issues.\n\nYou have to wonder where they&#x27;re finding contractors to competently build these and maintain them. Electrify America has a bad reputation for offline and broken stations, and Tesla might not bid on a contract like this. It would be cool if they built state capacity to just have charging stations.\n\nGOOD! I wish anti-EV states would follow suit. EV chargers are a landmine for business&#x2F;income taxes. Unlike a gas station, people have to wait at least 15 minutes to charge their vehicle. You could have TikTok-theaters (theaters that show trending videos across TikTok), pop-ups, restaurants, etc.\n\n  &gt; You could have TikTok-theaters (theaters that show trending videos across TikTok), pop-ups, restaurants, etc.<p>Thanks, I hate it. So you want to turn these ev charging spots into the equivalent of strip malls and billboards.\n\n  &gt;&gt; EV chargers are a landmine for business&#x2F;income taxes<p>I <i>think</i> you mean a <i>goldmine</i> for business &amp; income taxes?\n\n    lol, i sure did.\n\nMy city spent a stupid amount of money to build 13 slow chargers across the city based on public feedback. I have zero faith that this will fare any better.<p>The best EV charger is the one installed in the home. If the government actually wanted to spur adoption it would be through easing permitting and creating boilerplate contract language for apartment and condo chargers.\n\n  I tried traveling with a nissan leaf ev (24kwh) a couple years ago, and it was COMPLETELY impractical.  It was just a stupid leap of faith with giant portions of luck and silly time wasting.  3rd party charging services suck.  They have few chargers, they have few stalls and terrible information about them.  (The worst was blink, virtually always broken)<p>And then I tried a couple years later with tesla, and it was a completely different experience.  Telsas have large batteries, the chargers are very plentiful along most routes, have many stalls, and are dependable.<p>I came to realize having a non-telsa ev is really a waste of time unless you can charge at home and stay in range.<p>So anything to create a reliable network to travel I think is a good idea (for non-tesla cars)\n\n    I traveled round trip between NJ and MI last year using Electrify America with my ID.4. It was fine, no real pain points -- EA&#x27;s been improving pretty aggressively in my experience, and I think we&#x27;re broadly in pretty good shape.<p>I charge exclusively using public chargers.\n\n    Your experience with a Leaf just showed you that old technology in a vehicle with a small battery and slow charging is best for local travel and not good for road tripping. There is a place for such vehicles but the highway is not it.<p>Today, there are lots of much more advanced EVs from dozens of makers that have large range and faster charging. Over the next year, they are all switching over to a new standard charging connection (which was developed by Tesla. Props). The CCS charging network will also be switching over to j3400. Hopefully this increased competition will force more of them to properly maintain their networks or be replaced.\n\n    &gt; I tried traveling with a nissan leaf ev (24kwh) a couple years ago, and it was COMPLETELY impractical<p>A Nissan Leaf, especially the version with the smallest battery, is a commuter car. It&#x27;s meant to drive you around within your city, never being too far from a charger. It&#x27;s not meant to travel around with. Your experience isn&#x27;t a Tesla vs Nissan experience, nor even a Tesla vs non-Tesla experience, nor even a electric vs gas car experience. It&#x27;s a &quot;travelling long distance in a 100-mile-range vehicle&quot; experience.<p>Nissan, and most other car manufacturers, make cars that have much larger batteries and can go much further. Even most Leaf models can go much further than your 24kwh model. The charging experience is much better when your range is sufficient that you don&#x27;t have to stop and charge every 90 minutes, and thus have a better diversity of chargers available.<p>One might similarly try to travel in a gas-powered golf cart and complain about how impractical it is.\n\nI hate how we are doubling down on car centric transportation. Whether it’s an ICE or EV. At the end of the day, it’s another car on the road.<p>We take one step further with reducing or zeroing out tail pipe emissions. But take 3 steps backwards because department of ~~~highway~~~ transportation engineers feel the need to expand the expensive highways to accommodate increased demand. Ignoring all historical evidence that widening interstate highways or state regional roads is not an efficient way to resolve the issue.<p>Let’s not forget the increased amount of tire wear particles released into the environment, brake dust, and eventually the e-waste when lithium based battery packs need to be changed out.<p>Also where are these vehicles going to be stored? More parking garages. Less walkable infrastructure. More subsidies for the suburban rat at the expense of cities. More heavier cars, trucks, and SUVs on the road means existing infrastructure breaks down must faster. Thus the need to replace more often or maintain more often. All of this at the expense of local cities and state budgets. Also most cities tend to ask voters to approve municipal bonds for such improvements. These are private financial instruments or loans that need to be paid back to private investors. Each new muni bond is one more step towards filing for bankruptcy (hello Detroit!)<p>Instead of spending money on the people. We are spending it on stupid car centric infrastructure. Forget mental health, social support, universal basic income, housing for everyone, easily accessible public transportation, improved paramedic, fire and police response times.<p>We wAnT mOrE eXpEnSiVe RoAdS aNd hIgHwAyS aNd fReE pArKiNg GaRaGeS!!111\n\n  Massive changes to how most people think about anything in society are non-starters. Doubly-so with something as central to the American lifestyle like transportation.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why this is so difficult for some people to grasp.\n\n  Not everyone is a socialist, or high density enthusiast. Personally I want the local government to only spend money in ways that result in people being more independent of a dense centre, that allows people to have more control over their immediate environment, and less impact from neibours.<p>Roads and highways are worth the expense, I am not convinced when it comes to many other public infrastructure or services.\n\n    Socialism?<p>The current transportation system is largely through taxes and no not gas taxes. The way it works is that gas taxes and Federal funds are used to pay for interstates, arterials, and collector roads in almost every state and MSA in the US (pretty much any municipality big enough to apply for transportation grants.) The Federal government then helps fund road construction while states and consequently cities take the maintenance burden on. Maintenance itself is paid for through a combination of gas and state taxes along with Federal grants which are also based on other taxes.<p>The current system is already largely funded through taxation. It&#x27;s just a matter of whether you think those taxes should be spent on creating and maintaining roads or whether you think they should be spent on transit. The closest to use taxes we have is the gas tax and the Federal one hasn&#x27;t been raised since 1993 (state taxes differ per state and have been raised more recently.)<p>If you really want to move away from &quot;socialism&quot; or whatever, then make infrastructure toll based in the US. You&#x27;ll find though that toll roads are highly unpopular.\n\n      You have a very unsophisticated comprehension if you are taking funded with taxes to be the same as socialism.<p>The part of the parents comment that was directed at was &quot;Instead of spending money on the people. We are spending it on stupid car centric infrastructure. Forget mental health, social support, universal basic income...&quot;\n\n      &gt; <i>If you really want to move away from &quot;socialism&quot; or whatever, then make infrastructure toll based in the US. You&#x27;ll find though that toll roads are highly unpopular.</i><p>One example of this is Japan, where nearly all of the highways are privatized and tolled. To get to the nearest metropolis to me I can either drive for 3.5 hours and pay $60 in tolls+gas, or ride the bullet train for 1.5 hours for $70. (Now as soon as you have a family of people in that car, the train starts looking really expensive, but for business travelers it&#x27;s a no-brainer)\n\n    Choosing roads and highways are a form of central planning. Single Family Homes zoning and lack of mixed use zoning are a form of central planning. The government is intimately involved with regulating and encouraging car centric transportation.<p>Ultimately, using the term &#x27;socialism&#x27; is a useless label especially when it is misapplied. It is better to discuss specific policies and details.\n\n      Did you read the comment I&#x27;m replying to? \n&quot;Instead of spending money on the people. We are spending it on stupid car centric infrastructure. Forget mental health, social support, universal basic income...&quot;<p>This is a classic socialist point, one I feel the need to call out.<p>Yes, there is a decision on what to encourage, and I think it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that density inherently comes with more restrictions.\n\n        Single family zoning is inherently restrictive since you&#x27;re forced to live a certain expensive lifestyle. Not being able to ride bikes safely is inherently restrictive. Being forced to spend money on car instead of being able to afford &lt;insert-hobby-here&gt; is a form of restriction.<p>Density can support things like live theaters. It&#x27;s hard to support theater in the countryside. How about restaurants? Can&#x27;t really have the plethora of options without a large population. How do you afford state of the art hospitals? You need a large enough population density to make supporting these hospitals viable.<p>If you say it&#x27;s socialist or capitalist or &lt;ideology&gt; you&#x27;re really only hamstringing yourself in discussion about urbanism, making the entire discussion nonsensical.\n\n        The specific examples given there may be &quot;socialist&quot;, but they could just as well be &#x27;national defense and border control&#x27; and the basic idea would be exactly the same.\n\n          Of course there has never been a self-styled socialist country with strong border control. Definitely can’t think of one… nope. Oh, wait [1].<p>(1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;East_Germany\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;East_Germany</a>\n\n    If anything is socialist about this scenario it would be the roads. You want other people to fund the lifestyle that you prefer and are fully willing to spend their money, time, and effort.\n\n      This ignores a few things. \nFirst, I pay taxes, and my perspective is that the wealth created by my labour ought to benifit me. Just because some of that wealth is given to the government to be directed more efficiently, does not mean that it magically becomes an abstract pool of other people&#x27;s money.\nSecond, we are in a democracy... In order for the outcome I want to come about the majority of people need to be in support of it...\n\n  &gt; We wAnT mOrE eXpEnSiVe RoAdS aNd hIgHwAyS aNd fReE pArKiNg GaRaGeS!!111<p>Yes, we want these things, because cars are overwhelmingly popular.\n\n    A wealthy society is not one where poor people own cars, it&#x27;s one where they can afford to not to.\n\n      Go live in a city like Milwaukee then? 85% of the land area of Wisconsin has less than 100 people per square mile - it isn&#x27;t clear to me at all how even the richest society could blanket that area with useful public transit.\n\n        We managed to blanket it with cars and roads despite them being unaffordable in the long term. We can do it just fine.\n\n          Why do you think cars and roads are unaffordable in the long term?\n\n          Wisconsin is bigger than England with 10% of the population.  It’s missing the mass in mass transit.  Wisconsin is middle of the pack for density in the US.\n\n            And not even England makes trains work unless you’re (basically) rich and in a city center, or need to go anywhere other than London.\n\n          Let me educate you on what Wisconsin actually looks like since I grew up there.<p>50% of the population lives in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Madison, and Eau Claire.  Those cities, respectively, are in the southeast, northeast, south-central, and north-central parts of the state.  You could generously include Hudson and La Crosse in that list in the west and southwest parts of the state, respectively, if you wanted to add a couple of smaller-sized municipalities to tie the state together.<p>One more point of reference: Minneapolis&#x2F;St. Paul in Minnesota lies ~40 miles west of Hudson and Rochester, Minnesota lies ~90 miles west of La Crosse.<p>I-94 connects Minneapolis&#x2F;St. Paul, Hudson&#x2F;Eau Claire then turns south through Madison and Milwaukee, then to Chicago.  I-90 connects Rochester (Minnesota) through La Crosse then on through Madison and Milwaukee.  Another interstate (I forget which) travels north&#x2F;south and connects Green Bay, Milwaukee, and Chicago.<p>There is enough traffic along I-94 to justify a rail connection from Minneapolis&#x2F;St. Paul&#x2F;Hudson&#x2F;Eau Claire&#x2F;Madison&#x2F;Milwaukee&#x2F;Chicago.  There is also probably enough traffic to justify a rail connection from Green Bay to Milwaukee as well.<p>Remember when I mentioned that 50% of the population lives in those cities?  The other 50% of the population lives in rural areas and is generally involved in agriculture, forestry, or tourism, or support for those industries, and there are 2000+ small towns of 1000 population or less geographically distributed across the rest of Wisconsin, each typically 10-50 miles apart from each other.  The towns did not arise like this by coincidence!  This spacing actually creates an optimal geographic spanning tree across the state for the purpose of efficiently transporting food and forest products from rural areas to urban areas.<p>Now, something has to actually connect the farms&#x2F;forests to the towns and the towns to bigger towns and the bigger towns to the urban centers in order to transport the food and forest products (and tourists).  Traffic along the very rural links is extremely low; it is not uncommon to travel one of those links for 40-50 miles and not see anyone else on the link.  So let&#x27;s assume for a minute that it would be reasonable to build rail links, and let&#x27;s assume (generously) that there are no hills in Wisconsin and that we can lay it out in a grid across the 250 miles x 250 miles to cover the southern 2&#x2F;3rds of Wisconsin, with parallel rails separated by 10 miles:<p>* We need to build 12,500 miles of rail.  Cost to build 1 mile of railroad track is $100,000, so the total cost is $1.25 billion dollars.  Ok, not the end of the world.\n* We need to build and operate the trains over these rails.  Call it 100 trains.  Data on the cost to operate a train is sparse, but call it $100&#x2F;mile to operate a train.  These trains would need to travel back and forth (conservatively) 4 times per day; 4 * 100 * 250 * 100 = $10,000,000 per day to operate, so the total cost per year just to operate the trains (disregarding maintenance) is another $3.65 billion dollars per year.  _You can safely assume that the train operator - likely the state of Wisconsin - would lose $3 billion per year operating these trains_.  Why?  Remember when I mentioned just how lightly loaded the rural transportation links are?  There would be some days those trains would operate with a grand total of 3 people on board.  And oh, by the way, we still need roads covering the county in order to transport people and goods to the rail stations so we haven&#x27;t eliminated the need for roads or vehicles, unless we&#x27;re planning on increasing the rail grid by a factor of 10 each direction and now we&#x27;ve increased costs by 100x for both build-out and maintenance.<p>Also conservatively, we can estimate that the people in rural areas drive ~20,000,000 total miles per week across the whole rural population.  (Farmers don&#x27;t generally drive back and forth to town every day; maybe once or twice per week on a &quot;busy&quot; week.)  Call it a $1&#x2F;mile to operate a vehicle, that&#x27;s $20,000,000 per week or about $1 billion per year to operate the vehicles that the rural people require anyway.  Even if we built a 10-mile grid of trains the rural people would still need to drive that ~20,000,000 total miles per week to get back and forth to town, so this expense does not disappear.<p>Now, consider the fact that as soon as you travel more than 100-150 miles inland from the east or west coast the <i>entire country</i> generally falls into the situation that I described above, and repeat the exercise across ~2500 miles east&#x2F;west and ~100 miles north&#x2F;south to see how impractical it would be to blanked the country in rail.<p>Would it be feasible to replace highways with rail lines connecting SD&#x2F;LA&#x2F;SF&#x2F;Sacramento?  Absolutely.  Amtrak should be operating rail along those routes and should be making a fortune doing so.  Is it feasible to replace highways with rail lines across the US?  There&#x27;s just no way that can ever be economically feasible even if you factor in carbon externalities.\n\n        Public transport in Milwaukee is a fucking joke\n\n          I agree for the most part, but at least it is a tractable problem, unlike providing public transport for the entirety of Wisconsin <i>including</i> Milwaukee\n\n  &gt; We wAnT mOrE eXpEnSiVe RoAdS aNd hIgHwAyS<p>You bet. Plenty of choo choo trains available to ride in Europe and Asia.\n\n  As someone who’s lived in Japan, immensely enjoys its train system, and wants to see an equivalent established in the US…<p>Unfortunately, I don’t see a way for it to happen in a timely manner. Even if everybody dropped everything and started working on public rail tomorrow, with all the red tape, obstruction from a variety of parties, and general glacial nature of construction here it’d be an uphill struggle to get even a quarter of the country’s populated regions thoroughly covered with rail in the next 50 years.<p>If given the chance I’ll vote for implementation of public rail and am happy to fund it with my taxes, but I think electric cars are unavoidable in the interim. It’s better than continuing to burn fossil fuels that whole time.\n\n  I&#x27;m a transit activist. The infrastructure bill allocated more money for transit ($39 billion) and Amtrak ($66 billion) than EVs. The funding for EV chargers is a mere $7.5 billion. If anything, the angst should be directed toward the $110 billion allocated to roads and highways.<p>EVs are mostly just harm reduction. An important step but not the end goal in cities.\n\n  These are not MOAR CARS these are replacing the existing cars to cut down on the CO2 emissions.<p>EVs do contribute to brake dust but they do not produce as much brake dust as ICEVs. Yes, there is mining now for lithium, but that has limits. As the car fleet is switched over, the lithium and other minerals in the batteries are very recyclable. There are several companies with pilot recycling programs in place already even though the volume is small.<p>Not sure about your area but in our city, they are just finishing a massive expansion of the light rail network with more planned. The busses are being converted to be EVs, too.\n\n  &gt; Also where are these vehicles going to be stored?<p>I&#x27;d expect most people are going to store their new EV where they previously stored whatever car they traded in when they bought the EV.<p>&gt; Also most cities tend to ask voters to approve municipal bonds for such improvements. These are private financial instruments or loans that need to be paid back to private investors. Each new muni bond is one more step towards filing for bankruptcy (hello Detroit!)<p>...<p>&gt; Instead of spending money on the people. We are spending it on stupid car centric infrastructure. Forget mental health, social support, universal basic income, housing for everyone, easily accessible public transportation, improved paramedic, fire and police response times.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t many of those things on your list likely need in most cities to be funded by bonds?\n\n  &gt; Ignoring all historical evidence that widening interstate highways or state regional roads is not an efficient way to resolve the issue.<p>If the issue is transportation demand exceeds transportation supply for some portion of the day, and that portion is too high. I think you&#x27;re right, there are more efficient ways.<p>Reducing transportation demand is much more efficient than increasing transportation supply. Departments of transportation should be engineering recessions, pandemics, or ground wars to reduce our societal demand for transportation to enable commuting. Alternatively, they should consider forciably relocating some residents our of their survey area and limit population growth.\n\n    That is an impressively shit take and piss poor reading of the comment you&#x27;re replying to.<p>I would enumerate some of the many problems in your comment, but I can&#x27;t believe you would take it in good faith."

We need different sources.\n\n          Even still, both repos had READMEs [1][2] clearly meant to be read by the public. The archival was only successful years ago, with a failed snapshot as far back as 2021 [3]. This really seems like they forgot it was ever public.<p>Now, this is only about it being a GitHub breach. Whether unlicensed (emenel&#x2F;portfolio) or GPL (emenel&#x2F;dust) code should be allowed in such datasets is a different matter.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;origin&#x2F;directory&#x2F;?origin_url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emenel&#x2F;portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;origin&#x2F;directory...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;origin&#x2F;directory&#x2F;?origin_url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emenel&#x2F;dust\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;origin&#x2F;directory...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;origin&#x2F;visits&#x2F;?origin_url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emenel&#x2F;portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;origin&#x2F;visits&#x2F;?o...</a>\n\n          I used SW Heritage to identify the repos that were used for training, since op did not post the repo names.<p>The “different source” is supposed to be ghactions.\n\n        I checked my GitHub archive data and emenel&#x2F;dust is not there, but emenel&#x2F;portfolio is.

I spot-checked the first 10. All 10 are Public on GitHub. 8 of the 10 do not have a license of any type, meaning they are covered by copyright, at least in the US, unless GitHub has some terms extending the license of public projects to 3rd parties.<p>One of mine is Private and was an extension I sold for a short time. I can&#x27;t say if I ever made it public or not.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codazoda&#x2F;like_roller\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codazoda&#x2F;like_roller</a>\n\nCould &quot;private&quot; mean &quot;kept from the outside world&quot;?\n\nFrom one of the comments on that post:<p>&gt; I work for github. This post was shared in our slack, on a non work related channel. We don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s us.<p>&gt; They say they get data from SoftwareHeritage, a website that archives repos from github. If your repos were ever open, they might have been archived there even after you deleted from github.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s my best guess.\n\n  The OP responded to that:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@emenel@post.lurk.org&#x2F;112128613137436381\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@emenel@post.lurk.org&#x2F;11212861313743638...</a><p>&gt; thanks for the additional info. I’m pretty sure the repos of mine were private. If it were only me i could be misremembering something, but i have heard from a number of people that they also found repos in this dataset that were private. So i’m not sure what to think or how to explain it.\n\nThis is talking about The Stack. The poster says:<p>&quot;I found two of my old Github repos in there. Both were deleted last year and both were private.&quot;<p>The Stack was constructed a while ago, so &quot;deleted last year&quot; wouldn&#x27;t have an impact if it was constructed before then.<p>&quot;Both were private&quot; is the thing that needs to be unpacked here. Were these genuinely private repositories that had never been made public on GitHub?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;bigcode&#x2F;the-stack-v2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;bigcode&#x2F;the-stack-v2</a> talks about where the Stack comes from: &quot;This dataset is derived from the Software Heritage archive, the largest public archive of software source code and accompanying development history&quot;<p>You can search that here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;search&#x2F;?q=simonw%2F&amp;with_visit=true&amp;with_content=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;search&#x2F;?q=simonw...</a> - it would be interesting to know if the OP&#x27;s &quot;private&quot; repos are included in that collection.\n\n  For info, I checked and it looks like none of my AGPL licensed repos are included in The Stack. Neither are my private repos.\n\n    My GPL ones seems to be excluded.<p>I&#x27;ve got a couple that are intended to be GPL, but you wouldn&#x27;t know unless you go to the GitHub issues to find the issue I raised about the licence file not being in the repo. They are included.\n\n      It&#x27;s weird that they exclude GPL licensed repos, but not unlicensed repos. It seems like they would have even fewer rights with the unlicensed ones.\n\n        There&#x27;s probably a ton more unlicensed repos than licensed.  It isn&#x27;t weird, its capitalism.\n\n  &gt; Were these genuinely private repositories that had never been made public on GitHub?<p>The poster responded to that:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@emenel@post.lurk.org&#x2F;112128613137436381\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@emenel@post.lurk.org&#x2F;11212861313743638...</a><p>&gt;  I’m pretty sure the repos of mine were private. If it were only me i could be misremembering something, but i have heard from a number of people that they also found repos in this dataset that were private.\n\n    This is a really big claim. I think we need specifics on this - I&#x27;m inclined to think this is people not understanding the GitHub public&#x2F;private repo model (or misremembering the history of their repos) over GitHub deliberately leaking private code to third parties.\n\n      I agree that might be the case. Since I do not personally know the author, I elected to use “may” in the submission title. Hopefully we get a definitive answer from those involved.<p>Still, the post continues to be useful for those who want to opt-out regardless.\n\n        I would use &quot;claim&quot; rather than may until it&#x27;s substantiated.\n\n          Reads a bit weirder, but changed.\n\n      I would give it a 50:50 chance.<p>The other option is that the scraper got lucky with a tiny glitch (whatsoever).<p>On the one hand I bet github does everything to keep stuff secure, on the other hand I can&#x27;t believe there wasn&#x27;t a single glitch in the last few years.<p>And if there was a glitch then regular automated scrapers are a pretty likely siphon.<p>Heck I should check if any of my private repository show up.....\n\n        &gt; a tiny glitch<p>That&#x27;s not &quot;a tiny glitch&quot;. What you described is &quot;GitHub may show your private repo to strangers randomly&quot; which is a even more serious issue than they appearing in an archive some time later.\n\n          Right: exposing private source code in this way is a showstopper bug for GitHub, and a major scandal if they&#x27;ve been covering it up.<p>A lot of companies pay GitHub a LOT of money to securely host their code. A breach like this is a way bigger story than just another &quot;AI is training on your data!&quot; thing.<p>I continue to doubt that private repos being exposed like this actually happened here.\n\n      I have personally experienced this. The person who did it didn’t realise the significance of the repo being “public only for a couple of hours”. I’m also inclined to believe it’s misremembering &#x2F; misconfiguring.\n\n    I&#x27;d be interested in hearing from the cited <i>number of people.</i> If it&#x27;s like 5 randos, then that&#x27;s quite possibly a misremembering, or even conceivably the victims of some unrelated code theft. If it&#x27;s a few dozen people, well that would have very different implications.\n\n      One more person:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39770776\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39770776</a>\n\n        Seems worth tracking publicly. Maybe I should create a GH rep.... er... hm...\n\n          Maybe worth posting leaked Windows, Apple, Intel, Steam, The Wicher codes on GH as private repos and then seeing who will sue whom first.\n\n        I went through my private repos and the only one I found was one where I had forked a project, called `documentation`, and my fork made it into the Software Heritage archive. Sometime between then and now I deleted my fork and cloned a private repo with the same name. I confirmed the Software Heritage archive only has the one that was public and not the private one. I feel like we&#x27;d be hearing much louder alarm bells if the Software Heritage archive included private code given how many people rely on private GitHub repos.\n\n        That person is unable to provide us with a repo name either.\n\n    None of my private repos are included in the software heritage project.\n\n      Nor mine. But if anyone in the year 10,000 needs to run a 4-digit LED segment display as a clock with a 1st-gen Raspberry Pi, they&#x27;ll have the code to do it.\n\n        That’s really funny to think about. By then today’s internet may be the equivalent of the little NES machine you can buy with all the games on it.\n\n          He said year 10,000 not year 2052 tho\n\n    Considering private repos used to require a paid subscription misremembering seems likely.<p>It used to be public by default, and enough people got confused by this that AWS &amp; Github used to specifically scan repo&#x27;s for accidentally public AWS credentials.\n\n  Here&#x27;s a reply from a GitHub staff member: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@correcthorse&#x2F;112128192392083842\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@correcthorse&#x2F;112128192392083842</a><p>&gt; I work for github. This post was shared in our slack, on a non work related channel. We don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s us.<p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;bigcode&#x2F;the-stack-v2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;bigcode&#x2F;the-stack-v2</a><p>&gt; They say they get data from SoftwareHeritage, a website that archives repos from github. If your repos were ever open, they might have been archived there even after you deleted from github.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s my best guess.\n\n    Depending on the license, how is this legal?\n\n      Which bit? The archiving on SoftwareHeritage, the gathering of that data into the Stack or the subsequent training of models?\n\n      that’s a good question… There seems to be two problems.<p>The definition of open source depends on a license existing in a repo. Without a license it’s not legal to copy and distribute.<p>Public vs Private repo is a platforms issue not the code maintainers.<p>If a public repo does not have a license, it does not mean it free to copy and distribute.<p>If a private repo has an open source license like MIT, then the crawler has a right to copy and distribute that repo. Regardless if it has authorization to access the repo or not.\n\n        Hopefully the crawler smart enough to properly handle edge cases...<p>e.x. if the repo has some sort of &#x2F;used-licenses&#x2F; folder where the licenses for packages and the like are included, it could make a bad decision.\n\n        &gt; Without a license it’s not legal to copy and distribute.<p>Yes it is. Due to both the terms you agree when you use GitHub and the general Implied License that covers everything public on the internet.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Field_v._Google,_Inc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Field_v._Google,_Inc</a>.\n\n          Looking at that ruling, it seems the case you linked to hinged on a fact not applicable with the Stack:<p>&gt;Field had actual knowledge of the Googlebot. He also was aware of the ways to prevent Google from either listing his site at all or listing it but not providing a link to the cached version. Instead of opting out, however, he chose to allow Google to both index and provide a link to the cached version.<p>For the AI dataset, (A) did the person know their work was being collected by this group and for this purpose, and (B) did they know of a way to prevent that collection?\n\n          It is not clear to me if they are _only_ using GitHub as source. The Stack explicitly mentions they are using Software Heritage as source and Software Heritage definitely sources from repositories that are NOT stored in GitHub (and never have been).\n\n          I don’t think that “implied license” you’re referring to holds up in the courts.\n\n        &gt; Without a license it’s not legal to copy and distribute.<p>Is this true? When you post anything publicly, from sticking a poster on the street to making artwork like banksy, isn’t the default set to “it’s legal to copy, unless explicitly stated otherwise”?\n\n          The default in the majority of the world is that most creative works (including software code) are by-default copyrighted by the author, and the author must explicitly license away those rights. Some jurisdictions (e.g. France) put limits on what rights the author is allowed to give up. I.e., the default is it is illegal to copy (subject to exemptions like “fair use”).\n\n            Note that this archive project is French.\n\n          Banksy apparently runs a licensing program. Their artwork is most definitely under copyright, and they rely on trademark protection as well.<p>There is also the practical issue that a lot of content is posted publicly without consent of the copyright owner. It&#x27;s simply not true that just because someone else committed a copyright violation first, you can commit further violations without impunity based on that first violation.\n\n        &gt; If a public repo does not have a license, it does not mean it free to copy and distribute.<p>Whether or not it is free to copy and distribute, it should be free to copy and distribute. (My opinion is that copyright is no good; if the file is public then you should be allowed to copy and distribute it.)<p>&gt; If a private repo has an open source license like MIT, then the crawler has a right to copy and distribute that repo. Regardless if it has authorization to access the repo or not.<p>I should not think so. The license would only apply if you have a copy of it anyways. If you are not authorized to access it because it is private, then you would have to get a copy from somewhere else, and if nobody else is providing a copy, that shouldn&#x27;t give you the right to unauthorized access. However, if it has been done, then it is done, so now there is a copy, and the license (if it is a license that allows copying it in this way) would authorize you to continue to use and distribute the copy that you have.\n\n          i’m not saying I agree or care about any of it. A sane company would never allow the use of source code from a third party without a license.<p>If repo is forked and the license is deleted the source code would need to be hashed to verify its the exact version of an open source repo. Mainly they don’t want copyleft or “malcious” license infecting their IP<p>If the hashes don’t match then it’s not technically the same code, so a company can’t safely use it without a license.\n\n      In the US: Fair use disregards licenses. Fair use can be found to apply, or found not apply, by a court of law. Archival of information is generally felt to be Fair use, as is Search indexing.\n\n        The real argument is when is AI re-use of copyrighted material a violation of copyright. That is a large grey area that will probably be determined in favor of large corporations and not in favor of individuals. (As in, Disney can use AI writers to copy you, but you won&#x27;t be allowed to copy Disney)\n\n        Software Heritage aggressively insists on French law... which does not have fair use.\n\n  The software heritage sent me an email they were going to steal copies of my software. I think they assumed because it was published as a git repo they had unlimited rights to steal, reproduce, sell, etc my copyrighted work.<p>To quote the email they sent me:<p>&quot;The mission of Software Heritage is to collect, preserve and share all the publicly available source code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softwareheritage.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softwareheritage.org</a>&quot;<p>So they&#x27;re telling me their intent is to reproduce (share) my work, just because it was publicly available.<p>Upon my reply they did offer to cancel the request, but also told me they are facilitating the storage of my code for users private theft<p>&quot;\n&quot;Add forge now&quot; requests are submitted by Software Heritage users who think\nthat a forge is worth being archived.<p>After a careful examination of your arguments, we acknowledge that your forges may not be archived, so we won&#x27;t process their ingestion, and close this add forge now request. However, we cannot prevent a publicly available from being archived by anyone using our &quot;Save code now&quot; feature\n\n    Steal your repos? So you don&#x27;t have them anymore because they took them? Maybe ask nicely to have them back and with a bit of luck they&#x27;ll give them back to you.\n\n      reproducing my work without license is theft.\n\n        I mean, this is a matter of law, and it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a curious point to double down on.\n\n      Curiously, the people most vociferous about digital copying of IP not being “theft” tend to be those people who have produced the least amount of original IP.<p>Surprisingly, the people generating real, novel, IP like to buy groceries now and then.\n\n        Absurd, presumably anecdotal claim.<p>My own anecdotal experience is that it has no relation and I know many people who have violated the copyright on the IP they themselves produced.\n\n          how does one violate their own copyright? I mean, its my IP, I am free to license, distribute, and so forth as I see fit, there&#x27;s an implicit &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;.\n\n            People who produce IP either by work for hire or by selling their copyright rights.<p>I&#x27;ve had people &quot;steal&quot; IP by sending me a PDF of a paper they wrote whose copyright resides with their university. Not the typical image of a thief.\n\n      This is a sound point, even if it&#x27;s being made a bit sarcastically. Copyright and intellectual property are an entirely different body of law than property rights, and people most often conflate them as an emotionally charged rhetorical technique that&#x27;s generally rooted in a dissatisfaction that intellectual property and physical property are treated differently. The use of the word &quot;steal&quot; in this context is probably to incite readers to their cause, but ends up just sounding sophomoric to people that know anything about intellectual property law.<p>It&#x27;s a shame because the GP had some valuable information to share about the emails software heritage was sending, but likely got downvoted because of this.\n\n        Problem is GP (me) is a dickhead about it.<p>but frankly, it&#x27;s not the first time. Github (after purchase by microsoft) did the same thing to my code. They reproduced it and put it on ice in some place in norway. That was the guise right? I mean I am sure they did, but you can bet your ass they&#x27;re also using my code to train their AI.<p>Most of it was not licensed. It was publicly available as a portfolio so people would see I write serious code and would hire me.<p>So then I took down my entire github after being informed I was enrolled, couldn&#x27;t opt out, etc, and then some OTHER foundation is now scanning my self hosted git repos? That made my blood BOIL!\n\n    Do you happen to still have that email?

The email I got, which I assume is similar, was suspiciously lacking a &quot;just GTFO and leave my website alone&quot; option.\n\n      They explicitly told me they could not blacklist me, but they did do a prompt takedown.\n\n      I blocked their IP address specifically. Contact me if you want it.\n\n      At least some of their software has unique user agents (&quot;Software Heritage*&quot;). I wish a popular FOSS host like Codeberg would block them.\n\n    &gt; However, we cannot prevent a publicly available from being archived by anyone using our &quot;Save code now&quot; feature<p>This is not true. They just had to remove about 500 public repos to comply with my copyright.\n\n      It&#x27;s true as in, that&#x27;s what they told me when I asked.\n\n        They&#x27;re lying.\n\n  I have about fifty private github repos and hundreds more public github repos (half of them forks of other public repos). I&#x27;ve verified that none of my private repos are in the dataset, and all of my public repos are.<p>I was expecting to see at least one repo that shouldn&#x27;t be there depending on when the dataset was put together. In 2015 I changed a repo from public to private, which I think might suggest that the dataset was built after 2015 since my now private repo isn&#x27;t in the dataset?\n\n    I did the same and see none of my private repos. Which is quite a lot. I do see plenty of deleted repos but those were public.\n\n  Github publicly streams the global change log including all public repos.  I have a public repo and noticed there were multiple clones daily after every commit I made.  That&#x27;s when I discovered the API: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;rest&#x2F;activity&#x2F;events?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-public-events\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;rest&#x2F;activity&#x2F;events?apiVersion=2...</a><p>If the repo was public even for a single commit, that was likely cloned and replicated elsewhere.\n\nHmm, I do see some of my repos there, but only public ones. It would seem a bit too foolish of GitHub to put private repositories in a public dataset.<p>Is there any other corroboration or proof?\n\n  It would be fun to upload a private repo with AWS keys in it as a canary. If the account ever gets used, the repo is no longer private?\n\nAs with others, I can say they only seem to have my repos that were ever public. Nothing of mine that was always private is showing.\n\n  Same here, public only\n\n  Yep - same.  My public repos show but not my private one.\n\nIt is always interesting to see how copilot autocompletes things like &quot;Todo: &quot; or &quot;my ssh key&quot; and see what data leaks through!\n\nI mean, there is also a lot of &quot;public&quot; github repos that contain absolutely copywritten work too.\n\nI also see a 7 years old private repo from my account. But I may have made it public initially, I don&#x27;t really remember it. Anyone knows how to check if a repo was ever made public?\n\n  Check if it was ever appeared in gharchive [1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gharchive.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gharchive.org&#x2F;</a>\n\n  The Wayback Machine [0] if you&#x27;re lucky (?) enough to have had it indexed.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;</a>\n\n  If the repo was public for a while (say 2 years), and then became private, then the code in the Stack for your repo must be 5 years old.<p>If on the other hand, it&#x27;s tracked to the latest commit, that is a different scenario.\n\nI am Jack&#x27;s complete lack of surprise.<p>In all seriousness, without strong data privacy regulations (ie: GDPR), we will continue to see this sort of stuff, as the potential monetary rewards for using this sort of data far outweigh the potential liability.  Cost of doing business type stuff, rather than an existential risk for abusing public trust.<p>My opinion is that data should be treated like a fissile element - very dangerous to hold and store, but extremely powerful when properly employed.  However, it&#x27;s only dangerous if the liability of storing it is significant and real, as of today, it&#x27;s not (in the US).\n\nIt blows my mind that we’re all fine with “the home of open source software” is closed source\n\n  The way I rationalize my use of Github to myself is by framing it as me stealing free compute and storage from the evil Microsoft.\n\n    Trust me, they&#x27;re making it back.\n\n      I&#x27;d presume if nothing else in copilot subscriptions, populated by harvesting upteen bazillion repos, issues, and maybe even CI job run logs\n\n        i am pretty sure they would just clone stuff from BitBucket or SF if they didn&#x27;t have it on their own platform.\n\n        <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aibusiness.com&#x2F;nlp&#x2F;github-copilot-loses-20-a-month-per-user\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aibusiness.com&#x2F;nlp&#x2F;github-copilot-loses-20-a-month-p...</a>\n\n          The accuracy of that story was vigorously denied by people in a position to know: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;natfriedman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1712140497127342404\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;natfriedman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1712140497127342404</a>\n\n  especially with the number of actual FOSS alternatives available right now, but that network effect, whew, it&#x27;s strong :-(\n\n    I am considering moving away because of network effect. The more popular repo is, the more work is there (issues, PRs...). It&#x27;s not scalable.<p>Using another platform&#x2F;self-host would introduce a friction.\n\n      You can disable issues.\n\n        That&#x27;s not the point.<p>I am not opposed to issues per se. The problem is dealing with the amount, it&#x27;s exhausting. It&#x27;s just too easy to make issue or comment on GitHub because of network effect. This sums it up pretty well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nolanlawson.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;05&#x2F;what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nolanlawson.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;05&#x2F;what-it-feels-like-to-be-...</a> (my workload is of course far smaller, but still it takes time and saps energy)<p>Yes, that issue has been opened for 4 years and I don&#x27;t consider it important and neither did any of &quot;me too&quot; comments to do anything about it. At best I sometimes get drive by PR, which takes far more time to deal with than if I just did it myself.\n\n    What FOSS solutions give me an editor in the web, Codespaces, free CI&#x2F;CD compute, free website hosting, etc.?\n\n      I feel as though your question conflates FOSS with <i>free</i> SaaS compute, but <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salsa.debian.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;instance_configuration#gitlab-pages\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salsa.debian.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;instance_configuration#gitlab-...</a> shows they are using the community edition (MIT <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;gitlab-org&#x2F;gitlab-foss&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;v16.10.0&#x2F;LICENSE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;gitlab-org&#x2F;gitlab-foss&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;v16.10.0&#x2F;LI...</a> ) and using GitLab Pages so that&#x27;s &quot;editor in the web&quot;, &quot;CI&#x2F;CD compute&quot;, &quot;website hosting&quot; right there. I believe codespaces is &quot;we run a docker container with vscode in it&quot; so kind of a subset of &quot;CI compute&quot; but since I don&#x27;t use that, I can&#x27;t speak to whether it&#x27;s included in the FOSS side of GitLab or not\n\n        &gt; I feel as though your question conflates FOSS with free SaaS compute<p>My comment did not. The comment I replied to did. It said:<p>&gt; especially with the number of actual FOSS alternatives available right now<p>I find GitLab quite lacking to GitHub and don&#x27;t particularly see it as a compelling alternative to GitHub. Plus, there is no <i>actual</i> benefit to it being FOSS.\n\n          <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;gitlab-org&#x2F;gitlab&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests?scope=all&amp;state=merged\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;gitlab-org&#x2F;gitlab&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests?scope=...</a> would disagree as would the top section of <i>every</i> release notes post showing which <i>community</i> member made the biggest contribution to that GitLab release. That&#x27;s not even counting the fun things I can do to my own copy of GitLab which I can modify and host for my organization&#x27;s needs, no AGPL, no reverse engineering obfuscated ruby from a .vhd, just actual open source<p>You are welcome to find GitLab lacking (there&#x27;s currently at least 66500 people who agree with you), and &quot;compelling&quot; is up to you, but to say it&#x27;s not a full featured competitor to GitHub is disingenuous\n\nNeed more proof than &quot;pretty sure they were private&quot; and &quot;heard from a number of people&quot;.\n\nThis organization claims that they&#x27;ll allow you to opt-out, but they haven&#x27;t seemingly done so for the oldest request on their repository [0]. Pathetic.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bigcode-project&#x2F;opt-out-v2&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bigcode-project&#x2F;opt-out-v2&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1</a>\n\nThis is a nothingburger.<p>I have &quot;private&quot; repos listed in the dataset but they were all at one time public. Searching the SoftwareHeritage site I can find those once-public repos with ancient commits.<p>My private repos that were always private are not listed in the dataset.\n\n47 of my repos are in the stack, and none of them are private (and I have plenty of private repos)\n\n  Same here. I think some people are confusing private now vs private since creation.\n\n  I do think, however, that &quot;repo no longer public&quot; should be treated as an opt-out signal.\n\n    Which is valid, but what&#x27;s the timeframe for rechecking and validating if there&#x27;s been a change? I&#x27;ll posit it&#x27;s practically impossible to catch every single change within a reasonable timeframe to ensure that &quot;a repo no longer public, today, within a data set collected earlier&quot; would be excluded.<p>I may be misunderstanding your suggestion. If so, I&#x27;m curious to learn what I missed.\n\n      My assumption is that the &quot;my private repo was included&quot; crowd are misremembering that their repo used to be public at some point in the distant past (~years). My suggestion would be that they re-scan before each major revision of the dataset (such as this upcoming &quot;v2&quot; release). This would be a relatively expensive process given the numbers involved, but so be it.<p>(edit: I think &quot;v2&quot; is already released, but you get my point)\n\n        I can get behind this idea. Thank you for clarifying.\n\n  None of mine are in the stack and I am now personally offended that all those crappy little one-file Swift and sh utilities will be excluded from the singularity\n\n  From the reports it looks like they have to have been private and deleted\n\nAll of the comments here where the commenter found their repos say either &quot;it only has the public ones&quot; or &quot;it has some private ones from x years ago and i don&#x27;t quite remember if they were ever public&quot;.<p>So it seems probable this is a case of repo owners misremembering.\n\n  I agree. Only my public repos are in the data set.\n\nI&#x27;m curious how they get around licenses. For example, I have repos that show up in The Stack. Some have licenses that require inclusion of the copyright in any source re-use or redistribution.<p>IANAL, but it seems like inclusion in the data set and subsequent distribution without the copyright notice would be a violation.\n\n  Probably some obscure GH legal clause stating “we own your data. Ownership is implied and we may do anything with it. Private vs public is a concept of accessibility over the internet. Not necessarily means it’s not accessible via intranet or other non-public means”<p>It’s the similar legal clauses used for decades on social and video hosting platforms.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think that gets around the code licenses. They may use it as if it does, but I&#x27;m not convinced that would hold up if soemone were wealthy enough to make a court case.\n\n    GH interestingly doesn&#x27;t grant themselves nor others that many rights.<p>---<p><pre><code>  You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time.

It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.\n</code></pre>\n---<p><pre><code>  Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users&#x27; repositories, may be viewed by others.

(And hot take: Github should just let people disable the fork button already.)\n\n      What if we include the Microsoft Services Agreement? GitHub Copilot is a Microsoft AI Service\n\n  In The Stack FAQ, they claim that they are doing minimal analysis of the LICENSE file and SPDX tags.<p>I&#x27;d bet that this is enough to detect cases like GPL code, but I also bet that if this analysis fails instead of falling back to &quot;unknown license, assume proprietary, don&#x27;t copy&quot; they fall back to &quot;free lunch!&quot;. Because reasons.\n\n    I suspect you&#x27;re right.<p>Even though even permissive licenses like MIT and BSD require attribution and preservation of copyright notices. Maybe their AI just can&#x27;t &quot;reliably detect&quot; licenses.\n\n    At least one of my repos with no license&#x2F;spdx was excluded, though the source files do say &quot;all rights reserved&quot; in them.\n\nThe crypto craze stole our energy to validate digital currency transactions on the blockchain.<p>Now the AI craze stole our code and collective knowledge to ultimately train their models, and hopefully replace SWEs and other knowledge based fields (ie, medicine).<p>At least with blockchain, some people got rich. But with the AI craze the only people getting rich are the rich themselves.\n\n  &gt; At least with blockchain, some people got rich.<p>But plenty more lost money or went bankrupt. The one’s who got rich did so at the expense of other non-rich people.\n\n    &gt; But plenty more lost money or went bankrupt. The one’s who got rich did so at the expense of other non-rich people.<p>[citation needed]\n\n      Logical reasoning is still a valuable tool.<p>Where else would the money have come from?\n\n        I got &quot;rich&quot; also, but I&#x27;ve never speculated, and TBH I&#x27;ve sold, and spent, more spent than sold at all kind of valuations, and most of the riches are still unrealized, so, sorry if I doubt what you say.\n\n      <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cryptocurrency_and_crime#notable_thefts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cryptocurrency_and_crime#notab...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bankruptcy_of_FTX\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bankruptcy_of_FTX</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OneCoin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OneCoin</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bitconnect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bitconnect</a><p>Etc.\n\n        LOL what about the amounts the banks and bankers stole from us in the last decade and a half?

Only my Public repos included. All my private repos are not included.\n\nIs there any other good service for enterprise development?\n\nI do not use private GitHub repositories. (If I want something private, I will store it on my own computer and&#x2F;or on DVDs, etc.)<p>If they are using private data in AI dataset (or other uses) then that is a serious issue; they are copying data which is meant to be private. (Public files are public and should be made copies that others can use too, though.)\n\nEven though they were only my public repos in there, I really don&#x27;t like this being opt out instead of opt in, especially since some of those repositories were not under fully permissive licenses\n\nSo let me understand this.<p>Step 1) &quot;Software Heritage&quot; crawls the web (not only Github; they definitely crawl ANY gitlab instances they find online among practically everything else).\nThey &quot;store&quot; ANY type of source code, irregardless of the license of that code. They admit as much in their own FAQ ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#24_What_is_the_policy_for_determining_what_deserves_to_be_archived_are_there_requirements_for_a_GitHub_Gitlab_or_XXX_repository_to_be_archived_by_SWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softwareheritage.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#24_What_is_the_policy_...</a> ) :<p>&gt; Software Heritage archives everything that is publicly available, without preliminary tests or checks [for LICENSE file or others]. You are responsible for checking whether the source code you find in the archive can be reused, and under which terms.<p>Step 2) &quot;Hugging Face&quot; uses the Software Heritage dataset to build some AI training dataset (&quot;The Stack&quot;), again, completely ignoring licensing. You apparently have to manually opt-out if you don&#x27;t want your COPYRIGHTED source code to be included there. But as far as I can see, opting out is only considered AT ALL for Github repositories via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;bigcode&#x2F;the-stack-v2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;bigcode&#x2F;the-stack-v2</a> .

Any use of all or part of the code gathered in The Stack v2 must abide by the terms of the original licenses [...]<p>Step 3) Eventually and inevitably someone releases some model trained on this dataset, ignoring licensing again.<p>Step 4) Someone uses code generated from such chatbot, unknowingly violating everything software license known to man.<p>Step 5) ???<p>Step 6) Profit!<p>Where do these &quot;Software Heritage&quot; guys mention which user-agent their crawler is using so that I can permanently ban them from my websites?<p>At least archive.org does that and they have a much nicer way to request exclusion from their archive.\n\n  You lost me at step four. If reading source is fair use and generating content isn&#x27;t derivative work, this is kosher. As litigation mounts, we&#x27;ll learn more.<p>To me, a learning path that&#x27;s acceptable for humans is acceptable for AIs. All of the rationales for treating AI&#x2F;human learning distinctly feel flimsy and arbitrary. <i>&quot;The difference is learning scale.&quot;</i> So what? <i>&quot;LLMs just parrot derivatives of their training data.&quot;</i> No, they don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s demonstrably false, and theoretically absurd, for all the common cited reasons. <i>&quot;AIs obviously aren&#x27;t people. So their learning restrictions must be different.&quot;</i> Why? <i>&quot;People are financially benefiting from the AI&#x27;s knowledge!&quot;</i> Yep, that&#x27;s generally how employment works. Etc, etc.<p>My take could be totally wrong. I get that. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see where the courts fall on the issue. But personally, the critics&#x27; arguments feel profoundly crummy and counterproductive; applying their logic to pre-LLM systems usually results in horrendous alternative realities. But that&#x27;s just, like, my opinion, man.\n\n    Having an agenda to push much?<p>Anyway, this is strictly one level up above that debate, as here they are scraping source code which is NOT free, and whose licenses could explicitly forbid copy for use in training datasets, or by the military, or even by people whose eye color I don&#x27;t like.<p>For example, example code for proprietary tools which usually allows you to only copy it strictly for purposes of extending the proprietary tool.\n\n  I had this problem with Software Heritage for non-Open Source stuff in my personal Gitea.<p>I eventually had to specifically block their IP addresses from accessing my Gitea and threaten legal action before they took the offending repos down.<p>I still have them blocked.\n\nI and most of my coworkers have all found at least one private repo which we believe was always private to be in the data set version 2.\n\nOpt-out consent is the equivalent of assuming a partner consents because they haven&#x27;t said anything.<p>Consent is not Opt-out == Yes means Yes\n\nTime for an end to end encrypted Git Service.\n\n  Time to start large scale poisoning of repos.\n\nEncrypt your private repos.."

      "conversation_text": "I am of the opinion that instead of letting legaleses define good&#x2F;bad patent, we should let the economics work it out. Mandate patent filers to declare a public flat license fee . Along with annual recurring patent-maintenance tax to government  as some X% of that declared fee.<p>Market will decide which patents are worth maintaining for 20 years, and government get proportional revenue as well.\n\n  While that&#x27;s an interesting thought experiment and there are definitely good reasons to make it more difficult to sit on an unused patent, it&#x27;s already difficult enough for lone inventors and small organizations to get and keep a patent. This would require everyone to either have a lot of money up front to pay the maintenance tax or keep the license fees low thus ensuring that they will never have a lot of money.\n\n  That puts all the power over patents in the hands of those with deep pockets. They would be able to directly pay to prevent competition. It&#x27;s insane to eliminate limits on what could be patented while doing that.<p>They could fund the keep-away of basic things like &quot;ordering x on your phone&quot; with the proceeds from being the only actor allowed to do that.\nFundamentally exploitable system incentives.\n\n  Your solution seems to be addressed at solving a &quot;there are too many patents because they&#x27;re cheap to acquire&quot; problem, but that&#x27;s not a problem. Patents are expensive to acquire already. Bad patents don&#x27;t lack value. Rather, they offer insane value for little effort if you guess the right thing to patent.<p>Look at the EFF&#x27;s example. Say it&#x27;s 1987, you&#x27;ve been playing with AOL for a bit, and you realize that someone might want to use a computer to do stuff like ordering pizza deliveries. You file a patent where your &quot;invention&quot; is &quot;okay it&#x27;s like pizza ordering on the phone but you do it with a computer instead.&quot; Then you pass it through a lawyer who draws up some diagrams to make it look like it&#x27;s an invention, and boom, patent US4797818A is granted and you now control the entire online food delivery ecosystem until 2007. Oh, but then someone else says &quot;wait, what if the customer does that but USES A PHONE.&quot; Well, now they own that for 20 years, so now you both can arbitrarily limit this space. Great. Oh, but now swomeone says &quot;oh, but what if you do this and also the food is displayed IN CATEGORIES!&quot; Well now he&#x27;s got a patent, too.<p>It&#x27;s madness. The problem isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s too cheap to acquire and maintain these. The problem is that these are so obvious that they are no longer inventions.\n\n    One issue is that you don&#x27;t have to have a prototype to get a patent. Except perpetual motion machines, too many people tried.\n\n      For the example given though, it doesn&#x27;t seem too hard to prototype a &quot;order pizza using phone&quot; app. It might add a 10k expense or whatever to the patent, but that&#x27;s small relative to how much money you can extract from all pizza chains in the US.\n\n        My assumption is if you had ro have a prototype it would be more likely to discover prior art.\n\n  I declare that I patented human breathing. Every human who is breathing is to pay me the, really very cheap, fee of 1 cent per day. O there is a tax? So now I only get half a cent per day per living being.\n\n    You probably joking, but that wouldn&#x27;t work because of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prior_art\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prior_art</a>. All the &quot;bad&quot; patents were probably novel at the time they filed. That&#x27;s not the issue. The issue is that they&#x27;re for arguably obvious stuff like &quot;[x] but on internet&#x2F;phone&quot; that the sibling commenter is talking about.\n\n      Read the comment that I am responding to.<p>&#x27;letting legalese define good&#x2F;bad patent, we should let the economics work it out.&#x27;<p>If &#x27;legalese&#x27; cannot define good&#x2F;bad patent anymore, there is nothing stopping such a silly patent that I propose.\n\n  Or we could just abolish the concept of patents entirely. All they do is stifle progress so that somebody can make money at an unfair advantage to everyone else.\n\n    &gt;All they do is stifle progress so that somebody can make money at an unfair advantage to everyone else.<p>You don&#x27;t see any problem with pouring huge sums of money into developing something, only for a competitor to copy your idea and undercut you? As an inventor, why would I bother putting in all that effort knowing that would happen?\n\n      Same reason you would do anything else. Because regardless of whether you have a monopoly, you can still make money by solving people&#x27;s problems\n\n        If you&#x27;re going to invest in making something possible, you need to recover at least the value of the resources you expended in doing so. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll have no resources left for the next investment. Copyright and patents are capitalism&#x27;s attempt to make investments possible in a world where copying is cheap, and while they&#x27;re deeply flawed, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that investments do need to be returned.<p>(Don&#x27;t get me started on the stock market: that has <i>nothing</i> to do with actual investment.)\n\n          &gt;(Don&#x27;t get me started on the stock market: that has nothing to do with actual investment.)<p>Secondary markets support &quot;actual investment&quot; by allowing early investors to cash out. An investment is far more attractive to you if you know you can offload it to someone else and get the net present value immediately, rather than waiting years&#x2F;decades for it to pay out. For instance, if a nuclear plant takes will last 80 years but will take 50 years to break even, why would a 40 year old bother to invest? By the time it breaks even you&#x27;d be long dead.\n\n            At the cost of so deeply skewing what an &quot;investment&quot; is. How much destructive nonsense has been driven by the stock market? The South Sea Bubble, and every bubble since. Short-sighted decisions to meet quarterly revenue targets, at the expense of all else.

I would not call any of this investment, but the stock market would.<p>If they require disclosure of enough information for the technology to be (in principle) independently reproduced, patents are worth it. I&#x27;d even argue that patent terms could be extended, in some domains, where that&#x27;s necessary to ensure a return on investment. Copyright is, in principle, worth it, though the term is currently far too long and the laws can be abused for unrelated things (e.g. DMCA ink cartridges).<p>But the stock market is not worth it. The invisible hand of the market can remain irrational far, <i>far</i> longer than you can remain healthy and fed with a roof over your head, surrounded by friends and beautiful things. Let us not sacrifice what is good at the altar of the invisible hand.<p>The real estate market is similar: housing is for living in, not for speculative investment. The market incentivises real estate owners to ensure there aren&#x27;t enough houses to go round, driving up house prices – but they usually forget that they can&#x27;t actually sell their only property, so this only benefits landlords. (Irrational behaviour, sure, but whoever said humans were rational was a 20th-century economist who never read Adam Smith.)<p>Large infrastructure developments used to be handled at the community level, and in many places, they still are. For something as large as a nuclear power plant, that&#x27;d be your regional council or your national government. Hundred-year investments have to be made at that scale, anyway: that&#x27;s what your secondary market proposal is about, after all. The stock market is only one (highly-flawed) way of organising things.<p>People do not build sheds in their gardens because they expect to be compensated: they build a shed because they want a shed.

I think that&#x27;s the patents that attract the most ire, rather than pharmaceutical patents that don&#x27;t allow you fully reproduce the drug or whatever.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39763707\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39763707</a><p>&gt;But the stock market is not worth it.

People do not work because they expect time and labour to be returned to them: they work because they get other things out of it. We should not assume that investment of resources yields fruits in kind – but the stock market cannot but make that assumption!<p>The shed example actually shows a lot of problems with your line of thinking. Sure, for a project like a shed in the typical case, you can be reasonably assured that whatever utility can get out of the shed (eg. 15 years of storage) exceeds the cost you put in (eg. $1000 and a weekend&#x27;s worth of work). However, that&#x27;s not guaranteed to be the case. For instance, you might not be able to use the shed for the full 15 years, eg. if you&#x27;re planning to start a family and need to move in 2-3 years to a bigger home[2]. If that&#x27;s the case, the economy (as a whole) would still presumably benefit from the shed getting constructed. Future occupiers of the property presumably would have storage needs as well, for instance. You might not be able to use the shed enough to recoup all the resources you put in, but other people will. However, the shed doesn&#x27;t end up getting constructed because the person paying for the construction can&#x27;t capture all the utility. In a world with markets this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, because if the shed is something that other people would appreciate, it will boost the value of the home, which would allow the current owner to capture the full value of the shed even if he moves out in a year.<p>[2] you might argue that sheds are such a slam dunk proposition that even using it for 1 year would justify the construction cost. Even if we grant that&#x27;s the case, not every investment opportunity in the economy are slam dunks, and arguably we shouldn&#x27;t restrict ourselves to investing in only slam dunks.\n\n      If you are unable to make efficiently products based on your ideas, for the entire society it is much better if someone else is able to do efficient production.<p>The reason why the Western countries have achieved their dominant position in the modern world is because at some point, a few centuries ago, the secrecy of the manufacturing guilds has been overridden by the new trend of publishing openly any new discovery in science and technology, while the countries like China, which have remained dominated by secrecy, have remained stagnant during the fast evolution of the European countries.<p>The Silicon Valley has become what it is because in the early days of the electronics industry the concerns about &quot;IP&quot; were minimal, every new discovery was published and it spread quickly among all companies located there.<p>Then gradually the &quot;IP&quot; protection has increased, the competition has diminished more and more and the pace of innovation has slowed down proportionally.<p>It is extremely rare that those who have the original idea for a patent are also able to discover the follow-up innovations that are necessary to convert an idea into a successful product.<p>There are very numerous examples of patents which have been almost never used in anything useful as long as they were valid, but immediately after expiration many companies were able to make good products based on them.\n\n        &gt; If you are unable to make efficiently products based on your ideas, for the entire society it is much better if someone else is able to do efficient production.<p>What happens when the idea in question takes a non-trivial amount money to develop, and you want to avoid a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma situation where nobody wants to put in the investment?\n\n      This is such egocentric&#x2F;selfish thinking. I wish to live in a society which “pours” adequate sums of money into developing things for the benefit of all, not leaving it up to individuals like you who are in it only to benefit themselves.\n\n  Make sure keeping a patent is prohibitively expensive. Start with some trivial price y, like say a dollar. Then make every year cost equal to `(y*x)!` where x is the year&#x2F;month&#x2F;time period and `!` is the factorial function.<p>Any patent worth the upkeep for first 10 years is probably worth keeping it.\n\n    How does this work for patents like drugs or whatever, which are very expensive to develop&#x2F;bring to market?\n\n      Medical r&amp;d should be done by the government anyway. There&#x27;s no reason to allow pharma companies to extract untold billions of dollars in profit from the economy every year when the involved &quot;research&quot; is either trivial (such as with the insulin racket) or financed by the government anyway.\n\n        &gt;when the involved &quot;research&quot; is either trivial (such as with the insulin racket)<p>source that &quot;the insulin racket&quot; was &quot;trivial&quot; to research? Yes, insulin was discovered more than a century ago, but that&#x27;s not the thing that&#x27;s patented today. All the expensive insulin are enhanced versions that are better in some way (eg. lasts longer, reacts sooner). If you want the old, crappy, and non-patented kind, you can get it at walmart for less than $25.<p>&gt;financed by the government anyway.<p>Basic research that the government finances doesn&#x27;t cover the billions of dollars needed to bring the drug to market.\n\n      Then it works as intended, the pharma company at first enjoys a cheap patent, but gatekeeping the drug for years, until way after the r&amp;d costs are recouped from sales, becomes prohibitively expensive.<p>If the drug doesn&#x27;t sell a lot and is never profitable, then the patent gets dropped earlier to avoid sinking more costs.<p>If the drug cures cancer and makes millions, the company can easily recoup its cost up until the upkeep is too much, at which point surely it would be better for society that the drug be open for everyone?<p>Pharma companies are massively profitable, the argument of &quot;think of the poor pharma companies doing r&amp;d and their costs uwu&quot; isn&#x27;t really valid.\n\n  But some companies evolve on top of their patents and use them to obtain a competitive moat over a period of time to outcompete larger players. If the patents were available for a flat license fee, you’d penalize patent innovation by smaller entities as bigger entities could pay the flat license fee and copy the patent. So smaller players will either just keep it a trade secret and hope that no one finds out (which theoretically hurts society due to lack of published secrets) or have to hope they can monetize their patent super fast &amp; find someone with really deep pockets to fund that work.<p>And as mentioned, patents are super expensive. From talking to some people it varies significantly depending on your details but probably starting is ~10-20k per patent.\n\nAbolish software and &quot;business-method&quot; patents.<p>Until that&#x27;s done, patent &quot;reform&quot; is a sham.\n\n  What is the most egregious about software patents is that they work only because in the first few decades of software development no patents could be obtained for software.<p>Anyone who patents now some kind of software algorithm is able to write any practical implementation of the patented algorithm only by incorporating many techniques that have been invented earlier, but they have never been patented, even if typically they would have had much better reasons to be granted a patent than the newly patented algorithm.<p>If it would have been possible to patent software since the beginning, the software industry could never have existed, due to mutual destruction that would have blocked any development.\n\n  why shouldn&#x27;t software be patentable?\n\n    Because software is incredibly elastic, which heavily blurs the line on what is and isn&#x27;t a new invention. It is also nebulous, which means that it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to obtain a patent for a system that seems reasonable at first, but then decide &quot;actually I meant all of this other stuff too&quot; and on paper the patent does apply to all the other stuff too, because short of submitting the exact code to be patented you pretty much always get to do this.\n\n  On some level I think some things make sense to patent. And they are more algorithms. Let&#x27;s say compression of file or image or stream. Sure go ahead and give those a patent. If they are superior someone will pay license fee.<p>On other hand idea of compressing something should not be patentable. If someone can read few lines summary of patent and come up with solution that does same thing, but might not be interoperable no you should not get patent.\n\nPersonally, I would:<p>1) Limit the number of patents granted every year. Patents worked fine 100 years ago, when there were fewer of them. The standards for things like &quot;non-obvious&quot; should increase to keep a cap.<p>2) Ban patents on anything which only became possible in the past ≈10 years for reasons unrelated to the filer. E.g. no patents on anything which requires ChatGPT until ≈2030, so there is time for prior art to build up and to learn what&#x27;s obvious.<p>3) Change patent duration by domain. 20 year software patents make no sense (5 year ones seem okay). 5 year patents on e.g. aerospace seem to make no sense (20 year ones seem okay).<p>4) Make an open process where anyone can cheaply and easily attach prior art to a patent and try to invalidate it.<p>5) First-to-invent &#x2F; first-to-file makes no sense, as it seems that if two people invented the same thing at the same time, that should set a strong presumption of &quot;obvious.&quot; If two people file for the same patent, unless one is very clearly first in all respects, each should act as prior art for the other.\n\n  You remind me of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;592&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;592&#x2F;</a><p>For every point, you have to take a subjective decision that is in no way trivial.<p>1) Additionally to what happens today now you need to compare patents (how would you increase the cap for non obvious if you can&#x27;t say A is more non obvious than B)<p>2) Additionally to what happens today now you need to decide if something was possible 9 years ago. Our search tools are not that great at &quot;present me the image of 9 years ago&quot; and even then not everything is public, etc.<p>3) Additionally to what happens today now you will have same patent applied to multiple domains with small variations.<p>4) Yet another process, which now happens in court if someone thinks the patent must be defended (a granted patent does not mean it can not be later invalidated)<p>5) How do you decide very clearly first ? No improvement versus today.<p>I do agree with you though that the current system is not ideal. But a simple change like reduce to 10 years the duration might be the best next step (and while I like 5 years idea, making big jumps has more chance of push-backs from invested actors)\n\n    I thought you&#x27;d be linking to 793<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;793&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;793&#x2F;</a>\n\n    &gt; For every point, you have to take a subjective decision that is in no way trivial.<p>Have you ever been through a non-trivial patent filing process? Any other non-trivial administrative law case? A non-trivial court case?<p>This is precisely why these processes are so complicated, both under the rules I proposed and the rules currently in place. It&#x27;s why we have judges and lawyers. The way policy happens is people float ideas, much as I did, and as other people have. Those get discussed at a high level. If something looks reasonable, people do deep dives and work out the details. Those are further smoothed over as laws translate into regulations, and the contours are defined in case law.<p>I don&#x27;t think your comment reflects an understanding of the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve, which is narrowly patent trolls, and broadly, that it&#x27;s impossible to do anything without inadvertently stepping on a dozen patents.<p>WE NEED FEWER PATENTS.<p>&gt; 1) Additionally to what happens today now you need to compare patents (how would you increase the cap for non obvious if you can&#x27;t say A is more non obvious than B)<p>You don&#x27;t need to compare. The patent office administrative apparatus needs to adjust the bar each year. There&#x27;s already a bar set by them. That&#x27;s the point of delegating to an executive branch -- they can make changes like this one quickly.<p>&gt; 2) Additionally to what happens today now you need to decide if something was possible 9 years ago. Our search tools are not that great at &quot;present me the image of 9 years ago&quot; and even then not everything is public, etc.<p>Same as prior art. A patent examiner looks and has a discussion with the patent filer. It can be invalidated in court.<p>&gt; 3) Additionally to what happens today now you will have same patent applied to multiple domains with small variations.<p>Which I would like to reduce or eliminate. When LSA was invented, there was a swarm of patents applying it to every which domain, making it impossible to do much of anything.<p>&gt; 4) Yet another process, which now happens in court if someone thinks the patent must be defended (a granted patent does not mean it can not be later invalidated)<p>With one difference -- and this was lack of clarity in my writing -- my process kicks in at the time a patent is filed. If I want to avoid patent trolls in my domain, I can set up a search for relevant patents.<p>&gt; 5) How do you decide very clearly first ? No improvement versus today.<p>This is simple. I am switching from OR to AND. You have to be first-to-invent AND first-to-file. If you&#x27;re first-to-invent, and I&#x27;m first-to-file, neither of us gets the patent.<p>Indeed, if I&#x27;m first-to-file, but you can show that you invented before I filed, no patent is granted.<p>The improvement is fewer patents.\n\n      Do you know anybody working in a patent office? I know people in the European patent office and they are overwhelmed by numbers of application, they need very educated people to read through lot of (boring) documents and they do not get much incentive to be perfect (I mean salary is fixed).<p>&gt; needs to adjust the bar each year.<p>You make it sound like this is moving a slider - I have strong doubts this is the case, someone need to write a description, explain it, make sure people understood how to interpret it. Doubt that changing rules each year would work well.<p>&gt; A patent examiner looks and has a discussion with the patent file<p>You seem to agree that this is additional work.<p>&gt; Which I would like to reduce or eliminate.<p>Making a policy must take into account side-effects. The intention can be good but the result of it can be bad<p>&gt; my process kicks in at the time a patent is filed<p>One more process? There is a search already when you fill (or pre-fill don&#x27;t remember the terminology) something. In my limited experience, results are - let&#x27;s put it mildly - average.<p>&gt; if I&#x27;m first-to-file, but you can show that you invented before I filed, no patent is granted.<p>What is the difference with today? But this is easier said than done. Patent language is complex, details are very minor and people will argue very every little thing.<p>Fewer &quot;active&quot; patents and &quot;less incentive to be a troll&quot; would also be obtained by reducing drastically the granted period and that is clear and simple to implement.\n\n      &gt; WE NEED FEWER PATENTS.<p>If a system is implemented with this as its primary guiding principle, what you will end up with is fewer good patents, and a vastly higher proportion of junk or actively malicious patents.<p>We don&#x27;t need fewer patents. We need to eliminate software patents, better fund the patent office so it can employ enough people to properly review all the applications it gets, and probably do something different with biological and pharmaceutical patents (too many of these are built heavily on public research, and AFAIK it&#x27;s far too easy to make small changes and get the original patent extended if it&#x27;s still lucrative).\n\n  &gt; Patents worked fine 100 years ago, when there were fewer of them.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about the number of patents. In the distant past, patents were intended to allow individual inventors to monetize their invention for some time by selling licenses to companies.<p>Today, patents are mostly used as a weapon in corporate warfare and by patent trolls to extort money from companies, both a complete perversion of the original idea.<p>Not sure if it is possible to return to (and enforce) this original intent of protecting the individual inventor, but if not we should just get rid of the whole broken patent system in general.\n\n    You can: increase the price for patenting something. Google will think twice before spending 100K for hello world. Patent trolls you&#x27;ll always have, but you need to reduce them.<p>The system has to become again &quot;healthy&quot; to foster real innovation and competition,  not a garbage bin to block each others.\n\n      That would make it impossible for the &#x27;archetypical&#x27; individual inventor working in their garage or basement (if those actually still exist) to get a patent on their invention though.<p>Maybe companies shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to own a patent. If a patent is always owned by the original inventors (so it moves with them if they change jobs, and any patent license fees always go to the inventors), it would help. But I guess there&#x27;s always loopholes in such simplistic ideas ;)\n\n        &gt; if those actually still exist)<p>That&#x27;s what I fear is not the case anymore. And I am not sure we&#x27;re getting back there. With so many regulations in all industries, it has become impossible to innovate from your home. Unless you really want to patent BS like big companies do, which is ugly...<p>It sucks, but that&#x27;s how it has become.<p>If you want to protect such minorities, you can offer them a discount, but make it clear indeed that the patent belongs to the individual for even longer, not to the company.<p>Doing nothing as it has been until now certainly doesn&#x27;t help.\n\n      My suggestion is to double the fees every year so that only patents will be kept which really generate relevant economic returns.<p>My suggestion is 1000 USD in year 1.<p>After 10 years the fee is 1m USD per year.<p>After 20 years the fee is 1bn USD per year.<p>The current schedule of 23 years aligns nicely with this. If a Pharma patent is really generating billions of returns then maybe it would be worth for the company to pay 8 bn USD fees in year 23.\n\n        patents should be like 10 years max on any account in my opinion. You shouldn&#x27;t have to wait a generation for one to expire.\n\n      &gt; <i>You can: increase the price for patenting something. Google will think twice before spending 100K for hello world.</i><p>This is a terrible idea. Google will not think twice before spending 100k for a patent on hello world, but startups and small businesses would be priced out of the patent system entirely. All this would do is further increase and entrench the power of large corporations to the detriment of startups, entrepreneurs, SMBs, and ultimately, consumers.\n\n    If the system worked at all, an inventor could still make money selling IP weapons to corporations.\n\n  &gt; &quot;First-to-invent &#x2F; first-to-file makes no sense, as it seems that if two people invented the same thing at the same time, that should set a strong presumption of &quot;obvious.&quot; If two people file for the same patent, unless one is very clearly first in all respects, each should act as prior art for the other. &quot;<p>I think this is too much of a simplification. Imagine the case of blue LEDs. It was known that these would have a huge market, and there were probably 100 different research groups around the world spending millions of dollars and thousands of hours trying to determine how to make them commercially successfully - even with some early weak prototype and research papers. That&#x27;s clearly not &#x27;obvious&#x27;.<p>In our history, one team (well, really an individual) managed to perfect the process first, but it could easily have been two or more teams randomly hitting the same solution at almost the same time.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the &#x27;right&#x27; thing to do in that circumstance would be - award it to the team who happened to try &#x27;x&#x27; first, the team who filed first, or shared somehow.<p>But my point is that simultaneous does not necessarily imply obvious.\n\n    In real life, the inventor of the blue led was basically scammed by his company. The company earned a lot of money and basically shifted the whole business to produce blue leds. Veritasium recently made a video about that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AF8d72mA41M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AF8d72mA41M</a><p>I think this illustrate another point: patents should protect inventors, not companies. Companies shouldn&#x27;t be able to amass a &quot;portfolio&quot; of patents to bully their competition either.\n\n      I like the idea of making sure the inventor gets some portion of royalties.<p>To be honest, it&#x27;d probably help my employers too. If that was the case, I&#x27;d have dozens of patents under my belt. As is, I see little upside to applying for patents for my employer.<p>My general feeling is that the price of a patent application should grow in some non-linear way with the number of patents. Having a few, targeted, focused patents should be cheap. Google has around 100,000 patents (source: random web site; could be wrong; if it is, swap out for any other big company and big number).<p>For reference: Patent office fees for various services are currently $100-$1000. Legal fees are probably $20k-$100k. The patent examiner has very little time and capacity to do a good job, and there is a resource mismatch. In abstract, an alternative would be a smooth rise in costs along the lines of:<p>- First patent is $50<p>- Tenth patent is $500<p>At this point, moving from individual-scale to corporate-scale:<p>- Hundredth patent is $50,000 (so about equal resources to both sides)<p>- Thousandth patent is $200,000 (subsidizing the individual patents)<p>- Ten thousandth patent on is $1M to file<p>In practice, this hides a lot of complexity. I think the biggest problem I can&#x27;t think for how to solve (suggestions welcome!) is the corporate shell game. Google sets up a thousand subsidiaries, each of which files 100 patents.<p>Perhaps a simpler alternative:<p>- Individual personally filing a patent: $50<p>- Individual with lawyer &#x2F; LLC &#x2F; S-Corp &#x2F; small business: $5000<p>- Private C-corp: $50,000<p>- Public C-Corp: $100k\n\n        Would you imagine that you could you still buy&#x2F;sell patents?<p>In which case - Google, rather than applying for patents itself, offers a patent purchase programme for employees. It will buy every patent filed for by it&#x27;s employees as &quot;Individual personally filing a patent&quot; for 1000 USD.\n\n          Plus a $10k transfer fee and a $100k patent conversion fee to change a personal patent to a C-corp patent.<p>Transfer fees are not a bad idea in either case. If a company goes under, it often leaves a portfolio of patents which get auctioned off to the highest bidder. There should be some minimum bar there.\n\n  &gt; 3) Change patent duration by domain. 20 year software patents make no sense (5 year ones seem okay). 5 year patents on e.g. aerospace seem to make no sense (20 year ones seem okay).<p>One other idea would be to require a working prototype to be demonstrated as part of the filing otherwise the duration of the patent would be halved.\n\n  &quot;For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.&quot; ~ HL Mencken<p>The problem is not the number of patents. If you limit that number, what you will get is a host of patent trolls and other largely-bad actors optimizing to be the first to get each year&#x27;s patent quota.\n\n  I especially agree with #5, if you don&#x27;t invent&#x2F;show reasonable progress on an algorithm&#x2F;device&#x2F;etc within X (TBD) years the patent is useless; you should have kept it a trade secret or worked on it. Also, anything that is overly broad should be laughed out of the patent office. also current patents are far far too long\n\nThe core idea of patent was to protect inventors from richer entities stealing their work and mass producing it.<p>Patents nowadays are used by rich entities as barriers to entry to industry.<p>The whole system is broken.\n\nI was reading somewhere (forbes?) that more than 90% patents are anyways useless.<p>Most patents are to scare people like the average Joe that opens up a company and needs to be careful about a whole bunch of things. In reality, competition is so brutal that nobody gives a damn - and at very high levels, they will find a way out. Plus, to if we knew all the patents existing, there would be no new companies - you can&#x27;t patent obvious stuff, yet they do it.<p>Especially in our industry, we could have a better life without a lot of patents - mostly trivial stuff which shows how stupid our system is and why countries outside our system laugh at us.<p>Hard-core stuff like covid vaccines and unique innovations which outside countries feel cybercrime is worth doing - that&#x27;s probably the stuff you want to create a patent for. Although I have my own ethical view that vaccines and health-related discoveries should be open, but yeah, that&#x27;s another topic.<p>The rest is literally garbage that has to feed a broken system for the sake of keeping the system alive.<p>USA is in some cases really worse than EU countries in terms of modernizing things.\n\nI think that patents should only be enforceable if there is a commercialy product or service using it in the interval of maybe 5 years since the patent was registered. People making money by buying patents and suing companies is downright evil."

      "conversation_text": "This is... not a surprise. Jews have lived in Islamic countries for centuries, and had very good relations with their Islamic neighbors. In fact, there are many Jews with Arab origins living in Israel today. Unfortunately, after WWII, most Arab countries forced the Jews living there to leave (mostly to Israel).\nThere are minor Jewish communities in some Islamic states still, but in recent decades this is very rare (there is, obviously, a large minority of arabs, both muslims and christians, living in Israel. Yes, as first class citizens - I&#x27;m not talking about the occupied territories, but Israel within the 1967 lines).\n\n  During the rule of al-Mutawakkil, the tenth Abbasid Caliph, numerous restrictions reinforced the second-class citizen status of dhimmīs and forced their communities into ghettos.[15] For instance, they were required to distinguish themselves from their Muslim neighbors by their dress.[16] They were not permitted to build new churches or synagogues or repair old churches according to the Pact of Umar.<p>Is this an accurate portrayal of the good relations you describe or an exception? It&#x27;s hard to find unbiased accounts of what Jewish-Islamic relations were like pre-israel, especially since both sides have an agenda to push.\n\n    And yet this hardly compares to what happened in Europe during the medieval period.\n\n      It seems like neither the Christian world or the Islamic world have been safe havens for Jewish people.\n\n    There are examples of widespread persecution, but this is incredibly low effort. Al-Mutawakkil (who was Uzbek and Greek, for what it&#x27;s worth) was a psychopath that didn&#x27;t represent the general Islamic view. The pressures he placed on Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians and even other internal Islamic sects was not a popular view. Christians were regularly teaming up with Muslims to riot against the bad leadership[0].<p>The idea that it was enforced is even more dubious. The decrees were racist, sure, but unlike his more insane personalized antics (like when he ordered a holy Zoroastrian tree be cut down and shipped to him so he can build his house out of it[1]) the vast majority of the Islamic world didn&#x27;t agree or support any of it and it was unlikely that any of it was actually enforced. He had little support outside of the Turkic world and a North African militia group, and even that was far and few inbetween.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homs_revolts_(854%E2%80%93855)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homs_revolts_(854%E2%80%93855)</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cypress_of_Kashmar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cypress_of_Kashmar</a>\n\n      I&#x27;m not sure the articles you cited are enough to prove that all of his decrees went un-enforced but I appreciate the rebuttal and added context. What we can both agree on is there was widespread persecution and the relationship was not as rosy as some would claim.\n\n        You seem hell-bent on not compromising with his position despite writing we can both agree. Can you agree that in the more-than-a-millenia of history there were some rosy relationships without widespread persecution too?\n\n        Well, the more serious decrees (such as demolition of churches to punish Christian groups) didn&#x27;t happen[0], so by extension we can assume that the much more minor ones weren&#x27;t likely enforced either.<p>But yeah to call it all rosy is definitely rewriting history. All Abrahamic faiths are hyper-aggressive and whenever we&#x27;ve seen politicization of one we see the suffering of other faiths. Of course on differing degrees as different leaderships and empires came and went.<p>[0] Almost all of these churches were eventually destroyed&#x2F;taken over later, sometimes centuries later, but not during his lifetime.\n\n  I do think that your comment almost understates the relationship: in 1917, an incredible 40% of Baghdad&#x27;s population was Jewish.<p>The nature of historical Jewish-Islamic relations <i>is</i> obviously a matter of great political contention (especially now). It varied depending on the politics of the time and place—sometimes rich and peaceful (and indeed better than Europe) and sometimes tragic and violent—but for anyone casually curious, there is a dedicated Wikipedia article that I think is pretty good:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_Jews_under_Muslim_rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_Jews_under_Musl...</a>\n\n  Describing Arabs in Israel as first-class citizens is a bit starry-eyed, although they&#x27;re certainly better off than their second-class non-citizen cousins across the Green Line though.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Racism_in_Israel#Racism_against_Arab_citizens_by_Israeli_Jews\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Racism_in_Israel#Racism_agains...</a>\n\n  The fact that Israel carried out an intimidation campaign against Iraqi Jews to force them to immigrate is pretty much a mainstream historical discourse.[1]<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1950%E2%80%931951_Baghdad_bombings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1950%E2%80%931951_Baghdad_bomb...</a>\n\n    The source you link to seems to  indicate that this is not an accepted historical fact but very much disputed who precisely did what.\n\n  And I thought that enforcement is a direct retribution because of a certain nation being created in 1948. The relation certainly plunges downhill after that.\n\n  I&#x27;ve known Israelis and Arab Israelis. I would NOT call them &#x27;first class citizens&#x27;, there is discrimination codified into law and most state entities.\n\n  Jewish Arab relations historically were ok, not something I’d call “very good”. Some paces better than others, some times better than others. Generally though Jews were still second class citizens in Arab nations.<p>Here’s a wiki article that captures some the past issues. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Antisemitism_in_the_Arab_world\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Antisemitism_in_the_Arab_world</a>\n\nProbably most people ignore the good relationship between Jews and Arabs because it is not taught or communicated, sadly, often. They participated in math, medicine, astronomy, and philosophy.\n\n  From what i understand, at the time this thing was made, Islamic society was more advanced and way better for jews than Christian Europe.\n\n    Right, while the Christian Europe was amidst a Dark Ages and was torturing and burning Jews and others, Islam was in its Golden Age period. Too bad it was short and Mongol hordes ended it, leaving a significant mark on the Islamic culture.<p>Just realized we are witnessing at the moment two wars (there are more, but these two just get significant news coverage) by cultures who were scarred by Mongols - Russia and Islamic Empire\n\n      The idea of &quot;dark ages&quot; is a myth (pun with the username intended), but if anything it applies to the early medieval age, which is exactly when anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe was... not very common, since persecution of Jews started later: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Medieval_antisemitism\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Medieval_antisemitism</a>\n\n    Yes. And zionism as a global political force is in large part, possibly mainly, funded and promoted by christian zionists, and not by jews.<p>Comment above implies a dichotomy between arab and jew which is wildly ahistorical.<p>To an extent the migration of jews to Israel from arab countries post-WWII was done by Israel, infamously the &#x27;magic carpet&#x27; from Yemen for example.<p>As an aside, the urge among zionists to claim that muslims are the worst, OG colonizers is probably related to zionism being an explicitly colonial project, as stated by pretty much every influential early zionist. Cecil Rhodes was begged to help out due to his experience in this area, and the intimate relation between apartheid South Africa and Israel was in part made possible due to this similarity.\n\n  It&#x27;s probably not taught in the US, but it&#x27;s certainly taught in Israel, but they also include the periods after that when Arabs started massacring and prosecuting Jews.<p>It&#x27;s not a single time period, a lot of stuff happened, and the relationship changed - and not because of Israel (history didn&#x27;t start in 1948).\n\n    Israel is tiny and not influential in terms of global education. It is also studied in Jewish schools around the globe but also this is tiny comparing to the world itself.\n\n    1000% the current state of Islamo-Judaic relations is because of Israel. I really cannot fathom what alternate reality is otherwise.<p>How you want to decide who to blame for what is a different story, but the fact is what it is. History didn&#x27;t begin in 1948, but the formation of Israel (which began before WWII) is what kicked off the current colder than ice relations between the two religions.\n\n      &gt; I really cannot fathom what alternate reality is otherwise.<p>So all the massacres of Jews by Arabs before 1948 were done via time machine?<p>&gt; is what kicked off the current colder than ice relations between the two religions.<p>This is laughably false.\n\n        You didn&#x27;t read my comment. The formation of Israel began earlier than 1948. Arabs and Jews didn&#x27;t begin killing each other out of nowhere. They did it over land disagreements which began because of Zionism which was almost a century old and being implemented well before WWII came around. Please learn history and stop spreading disinfo\n\n          That&#x27;s an ... interesting alternate history. But modern Zionism started in 1882, yet the Genocide of Safed was in 1834.<p>Reading the article about it it&#x27;s clear the local authorities did not prosecute Jews as a policy - but, the local population was full of hate for Jews.<p>You see it over and over when reading the history of the area - the official policy allowed Jews, while the individual people wanted to kill the Jews. Nothing has changed today.<p>And the hate for Jews was obviously not because of modern Israel, since that didn&#x27;t exist, not was even thought of.\n\n            If you think I&#x27;m saying anyone anywhere hating Jews in the modern day is only because of Israel, then we&#x27;re on different wavelengths. The overall, global decline in healthy relations between the religions largely has its locus in the creation and sustaining of Israel. Just as there are violent clashes there are good interactions, but the current political reality has subdued the latter and increased the former.<p>It&#x27;s the same way as the creation of modern Pakistan has substantially decreased good relations between Muslims and Hindus. The idea that either side is wholly evil and the opposite is justified in its hate is completely contrary to everything we know about human beings. The average Hindu is very amenable to growing animosity towards Muslims when he sees his nation&#x27;s arch rival, an ethno-religious state, send spies over the border, orchestrate bombings, etc. And that&#x27;s how many in the Muslim world feel about Israel who has also orchestrated bombings, assassinations, etc. in their countries.\n\n              You are rewriting history. <i>WHY</i> did the creation of Israel have to be associated with bad relationships? After all the Jews purchased all the land they were going to live on, and the partition gave them empty land. And it&#x27;s not like it was their national land - it was not a country. It was only personal land, and that was exchanged via purchase.<p>The Arabs responded with anger and a war. The reason is that hate by Arabs long predates this time period. Have a look:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishrefugees.org.uk&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;massacre-of-jews-by-muslims-before-1948.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishrefugees.org.uk&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;massacre-of-jews-b...</a><p>You are writing as if Israel was some &quot;new change&quot; that made Arabs mad, but that&#x27;s not the case, it&#x27;s simply a continuation of what never changed.\n\nSorry for the sidetrack, but that is such an incredibly beautiful object, with those delicate etched hyperbolae. So much skill and craft went into making it and you can see that it is a superbly-designed practical tool that was well-used. It&#x27;s quite humbling to see things like that."

      "conversation_text": "This seems like a general problem for a company like this: your great success demonstrates that your employees are incredibly valuable. And sometimes businesses may say things like &quot;our people are our greatest asset&quot;, but that&#x27;s not actually true. They&#x27;re not an asset. Your IP is an asset, and you own that. But your people are often capable of going elsewhere and producing equally good work, and they&#x27;re likely to do that if they get a better offer.\n\n  So give them real ownership of the company and real fruits of their labor. Otherwise yea why wouldn’t they go to the highest bidder?\n\n    That would be ridiculous. All the upside is supposed to go to a small handful of people who already have more money than they need.\n\n    Are you talking about options?\n\n  It&#x27;s no different than professional sports. When you win the super bowl for instance, the value of many of your players (employees) suddenly jump. At that point it&#x27;s infeasible to pay everyone what they can realistically get on the market. Thus you identify and pay your most essential assets, and the others leave and receive huge pay bumps.<p>I think it&#x27;s very valuable for the industry, and as long as the teams who are picking up these employees are able to utilize them effectively, will result in broader innovation.\n\n    &gt; At that point it&#x27;s infeasible to pay everyone what they can realistically get on the market.<p>Largely, because of salary caps created fairly explicitly to break the winning -&gt; popularity -&gt; money -&gt; monopolizing talent -&gt; winning positive feedback loop.<p>Success feedback loops aren&#x27;t quite so constrained in most other industries.\n\n      With the compensation deferral setup (like Ohtani in MLB), I&#x27;m curious if the influence of the caps will be eroded.\n\n    Interesting dynamic, never thought of that.<p>Were there instances where a sports club actually didn&#x27;t want to win some title to prevent exactly this from happening? How would the sports association react if the club decided to throw the match for this reason?\n\n      Sumo wrestlers throwing away matches so that the other player can record a winning streak.\n\n      Well, I know it’s not the same thing.  But some sports clubs do try to lose so they can get a higher place in the draft picks.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tanking_(sports)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tanking_(sports)</a><p>And of course when kids don’t want to play during the summer  &#x2F;s<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Losing_Edge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Losing_Edge</a>\n\n  You assume that IP once created stands on its own. The programming as theory building view suggests that IP will degrade once people who have robust mental models about how the IP was created and works. So software&#x2F;IP in essence has two critical parts that need to be there, the actual work that was created and robust mental models living in people’s heads who continue to work on those projects.<p>It also goes against the idea that programmers are replaceable cogs that management can change out as and when they want to.\n\n    I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding the GP. He&#x27;s not saying the people aren&#x27;t valuable; he&#x27;s saying they aren&#x27;t assets. That is to say, they aren&#x27;t property.<p>Which isn&#x27;t what &#x27;asset&#x27; means, but it <i>is</i> the central meaning; using it on people always felt squicky to me.\n\n  In my experience this kind of mass exodus is more associated with failures in leadership&#x2F;management than an inevitable result of success. For example, OpenAI has been far more successful than Stability and its senior employees obviously have lots of options, but its staff turnover ratio feels much smaller than Stability&#x27;s.\n\n    Isn&#x27;t that largely because they&#x27;re all locked into comp structures that can net top researchers something ~$10M?<p>I guess one could argue it&#x27;s a management issue that Sam Altman figured out a way to structure his company to make that possible.\n\n  &gt; They’re not an asset. Your IP is an asset.<p>While true for existing IP for industries like pharma, for industries like AI, your IP isn’t worth anything unless it keeps evolving. If you lose your key researchers, you’re done.\n\n  &quot;Our people are our greatest third-party suppliers&quot; just doesn&#x27;t have the same ring to it.\n\n  They&#x27;re not an asset but they&#x27;re a hell of a lot more valuable than the IP. Ask anyone who runs a research org. The IP is nice but it deprecates rapidly. It&#x27;s the fastest depreciating asset ever. The value is all the machine (network of talented people, culture) that builds the machine (IP).\n\nThe source article [0] might be a better link.

It seems once you get started, everything else tends to fall into place more smoothly.<p>I&#x27;m eager to know others&#x27; perspectives.\n\n  Because of the FTC, BigTech is more reticent to do an acquisition.<p>So like in the case of Inflection.ai, Microsoft just did an acquihire of the entire team and “licensed” the technology&#x2F;IP from what now is a shell of a company.\n\nIt makes me wonder if I should switch from my current position as a Java dev to something related to AI and machine learning. It seems that is going to be the future now, and there seems to be a big need for people with that knowledge right now.\n\n  Yes, if you&#x27;re willing to invest X years into becoming relevant on the AI&#x2F;ML market, and you believe than in X years there will be still too few AI&#x2F;ML specialists - then it&#x27;s a great idea.\n\n    There&#x27;s a huge amount of help needed in AI&#x2F;ML in non-researcher roles (infrastructure, pipelines, testing, etc).  I&#x27;d say that the bulk of AI&#x2F;ML orgs are actually just that, in my experience.<p>(I&#x27;d further argue that the number of actual &quot;AI researchers&quot; that actually contribute enough to justify their mega-million comp packages is small indeed... but that&#x27;s a separate topic)\n\n      Infrastructure was another area I was thinking of possibly moving into as well, since AI of course still has to rely on that as well.\n\n    To the parent: “AI” in 2024 is just using REST APIs. Don’t bother inventing new models, just get up to speed on what the various vendors are good at and the basic techniques (particularly Agents&#x2F;ReAct and RAG) and you’ve learned enough. The demand for AI is almost unlimited right now, and it’s definitely not too late. It’s like 2009 in the iPhone dev era; plenty of time to quickly learn ObjC.\n\n  yep I did an analysis on this and that’s definitely where the software jobs are right now: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloomberry.com&#x2F;how-ai-is-disrupting-the-tech-job-market-data-from-20m-job-postings&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloomberry.com&#x2F;how-ai-is-disrupting-the-tech-job-mar...</a>\n\n    Good article, thanks for posting.\n\n    Interesting Article. Looks like it would be worthwhile to dedicate some of my free time into specializing in AI more\n\n  Dotcoms, then add tech (the money of Web 2.0), crypto&#x2F;blockchain, AI&#x2F;ML...<p>If you are hearing about it, and you aren&#x27;t already in, it might be too late.<p>That having been said, it&#x27;s a prime time to have project that you can bootstrap into a startup. You dont need to be google, you need to be google, small teams can clear a few mill a year with the right product and not get much larger.\n\n    AI has this difference to the other booms that the resources required to train a large model are out of reach of a student in a college dorm.\n\n  I&#x27;d say this is a &quot;yes&quot;, and remember that there&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> of work that doesn&#x27;t involve actually training models.  Every company right now has a big need for help in infrastructure, data pipelines, ops, monitoring + dashboards, internal tools, CI&#x2F;CD, release management, etc.\n\n  Probably too late now. At least for this cycle.\n\n  The way job hunting is in the industry now with recruiters and employers relying on automated systems to filter resumes it couldn&#x27;t hurt. Even if it&#x27;s just something to slap on your resume to get noticed. Most of the people responsible for hiring in our industry now don&#x27;t know or understand what they&#x27;re hiring for anymore. AI isn&#x27;t changing job roles so much as it&#x27;s changing job titles.\n\nHey now, there&#x27;s a real lack of information in this tweet.  Just a link to a paywalled article from a dodgy financial journal.<p>This is the second time this has been referenced on the front page and I still don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re talking about or what the details are (and I&#x27;m not about to give money to <i>forbes</i>, of all people.)\n\n[dupe]<p>Some more discussion on Forbes article here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39768402\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39768402</a>\n\nInteresting. It&#x27;s not mentioned in the article, but the team behind the recently released &quot;Stable Cascade&quot; models has left stability as well.<p>Personally, I assume stability has hit a scaling&#x2F;money issue on image generation models, which is why they might be pivoting to other domains where you can still make headlines spending &lt;$50M on training runs, like their 3D models.\n\nI mean, since we&#x27;re sharing Forbes links\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;kenrickcai&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;04&#x2F;stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration&#x2F;?sh=437f3ec075c5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;kenrickcai&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;04&#x2F;stable-di...</a><p>The CEO of Stability seems to be rather controversial person at the helm of a rather controversial company.  I&#x27;m honestly surprised more people haven&#x27;t left the company by now, unless they had some absurd incentives to stick around.\n\n  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;NHdKM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;NHdKM</a>\n\nSad to hear, they really created some awesome models for the community. Looks like their entire diffusion team left. Do we know where they went to? Hopefully another organisation pops up without the incompetent discord based leadership and that actually finds a way to finance themselves while releasing weights in some capacity."

      "conversation_text": "This would be very useful if it wasn&#x27;t for Discord:<p>&gt; <i>Note: Using an unofficial client at all is against Discord&#x27;s Terms of Service and may cause your account to be banned! Use at your own risk!</i>\n\n  I know that we all work on what we want to work on for reasons even we do not understand sometimes, but I do wish people motivated to work on projects like this would dedicate that time elsewhere, somewhere they are wanted. Why not make a great Matrix client or improve that ecosystem somehow otherwise? Why make a Discord client when Discord literally does not want you to?\n\n    While I agree with the sentiment, there is no lack of Matrix client side-projects.\n\n    I wholeheartedly agree but working on something you can use is much more fun, and the chances this person uses discord are much higher than of them using matrix\n\n    What&#x27;s a dev to do when their friends are on Discord?\n\n    &gt; somewhere they are wanted.<p>While Discord might officially not allow it, a lot of folks do want the option of using different clients. There are a few out there and generally speaking it does like discord doesn&#x27;t crack down on it unless they see odd api usage. *DISCLAIMER:* Still very much use at your own risk. I am not responsible for banned accounts.<p>&gt; Why not make a great Matrix client or improve that ecosystem somehow otherwise?<p>Likely for the same reason there are still relatively few feature complete matrix clients out there. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are a ton of clients out there with some functionality. But few that support all functionality. For the longest time it was just Element.<p>A large reason for that has to do with how complex the Matrix protocol is to deal with. To be fair, the discord API also has become a hot mess with all the features tagged on over the years. But the basic API for just chat is fairly straightforward. Not to mention that there are multiple wrapper libraries for various languages out there that make things even easier.<p>Also, people work on projects they benefit from themselves. Or at least the ones they are motivated to do. If someone isn&#x27;t on Matrix why should they invest the time and effort to get effectively nothing in return?\n\n      What&#x27;s complex about the Matrix Protocol?\n\n    nobody cares what discord wants, their client sucks and lots of people want an alternative.\n\n    &gt;Why make a Discord client when Discord literally does not want you to?<p>Discord&#x27;s hostility is irrelevant if you desire to write a client. Kind of like climbing a mountain because it&#x27;s there; who cares if the mountain will probably kill you.<p>&gt;I do wish people motivated to work on projects like this would dedicate that time elsewhere, somewhere they are wanted.<p>If that desire was expressed in the form of compensation, more devs would probably start lining up.<p>I realize the very concept of compensation is heresy for FOSS, though.\n\n    At the time when yim,icq,msnm had their primetime no company behind it wanted third party clients.<p>&quot;Why make a Discord client when Discord literally does not want you to?&quot;\nWhy make another X when you could improve Y.\nBecause most of the time if they wouldn&#x27;t build X they wouldn&#x27;t improve Y. This is no company that balance human resources.\n\n    &gt; Why not make a great Matrix client or improve that ecosystem somehow otherwise?<p>From my dabbling, I would say Discord&#x27;s API is a lot easier and better documented. Matrix has a billion different standards, a complex message format, and encryption to deal with. There are libraries, but they&#x27;re not easy to use, sometimes incomplete, and are rarely documented beyond &quot;this is how you send a ping bot&quot;.<p>Also, people actually use Discord a lot. Matrix is big, but not Discord big. In practice, Discord rarely ever bans anyone for using alternative clients either.<p>I don&#x27;t like the way Discord is now the standard for communities, but I&#x27;m not too surprised about it either. At least open source projects seem to use Matrix, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my gaming buddies because of how odd the clients generally are.\n\n      &gt; Matrix has a billion different standards<p>There is one specification, available on the official site.  It isn&#x27;t, and never will be, required to implement all of it.<p>&gt; a complex message format<p>It is a very simple format.  Here&#x27;s an example message (as sent by a client; additional fields are added by the server, such as server-side timestamp):<p><pre><code>    {\n        &quot;content&quot;: {\n            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Hello, world.&quot;,\n            &quot;msgtype&quot;: &quot;m.text&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;m.room.message&quot;,\n    }\n</code></pre>\n&gt; and encryption to deal with<p>This is also optional.  If you want to talk in unencrypted public rooms, for example, you needn&#x27;t bother with it.<p>The spec is so simple that you can send a Matrix message from a shell with curl.  It&#x27;s just JSON over HTTP.\n\n        The official spec is a combination of hundreds of tiny specs and extensions, akin to XMPP. There may be one single reference, but it&#x27;s constantly evolving.<p>&gt; It is a very simple format.<p>In a best case scenario, sure. The Discord version of your example would just be &quot;Hello, world&quot; without any of the other JSON.<p>In practice, you need to deal with a whole range of message types with various references and slight variations. Inner Matrix message bodies are essentially freeform, which makes Matrix quite powerful but also difficult to deal with compared to the &quot;different HTTP endpoint per request type&quot; approach Discord takes.<p>&gt; This is also optional. If you want to talk in unencrypted public rooms, for example, you needn&#x27;t bother with it.<p>Sure, if you accept having your users install two different apps, one for encrypted chat and one for group chats.\n\n          &gt; The official spec is a combination of hundreds of tiny specs and extensions, akin to XMPP.<p>You could say the same thing about any specification that involved multiple features.<p>&gt;  There may be one single reference, but it&#x27;s constantly evolving.<p>So is HTML.  But one of my Matrix clients from 7 years ago still works.  How well would a 7-year-old Web browser work on today&#x27;s Web?  Could you use a 7-year-old version of a third-party Discord client?<p>&gt; In a best case scenario, sure. The Discord version of your example would just be &quot;Hello, world&quot; without any of the other JSON.<p>So Discord encodes the message type in the URL instead of the body.  So what?  It has to go somewhere, and I&#x27;d generally rather have URLs include less, not more.<p>I actually messed up earlier: The `type` field is included in the event as seen after sending.  The sent event could just be, e.g.<p><pre><code>    {\n        &quot;content&quot;: {\n            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Hello, world.&quot;,\n            &quot;msgtype&quot;: &quot;m.text&quot;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t see anything to complain about there.  (Sure, I&#x27;d prefer Lisp expressions over JSON, but come on.)<p>&gt; In practice, you need to deal with a whole range of message types with various references and slight variations.<p>Is the same not true for Discord?  It supports a variety of message types as well, and Discord also constantly evolves the system and adds new features (every time I log on to it I&#x27;m bombarded with news of updates, yet I still can&#x27;t find a way to view a simple list of &quot;servers&quot; I&#x27;m in <i>by names</i> instead of by unintelligible icons).<p>&gt; In practice, you need to deal with a whole range of message types with various references and slight variations. Inner Matrix message bodies are essentially freeform, which makes Matrix quite powerful but also difficult to deal with compared to the &quot;different HTTP endpoint per request type&quot; approach Discord takes.<p>That seems to conflate two issues.  And I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s more difficult to deal with than any key-value store in any program.  You collect the values from the keys you care about.  That&#x27;s it.  Every Matrix event has certain basic fields in common.  A few are specific for message type (e.g. a filename field for a file or image upload event).  Where&#x27;s the problem?  Destructuring incoming data is probably the easiest part of writing a messaging client.<p>&gt; Sure, if you accept having your users install two different apps, one for encrypted chat and one for group chats.<p>I use unencrypted 1:1 chats as well (in which case it&#x27;s no worse than IRC or Discord, where the server operator could read your messages).<p>I think that&#x27;s pretty cool, frankly: that a modern system with well-audited end-to-end encryption still allows it to be used optionally.  You&#x27;re not required to deal with the complexity of key management and session verification if you don&#x27;t need or want it.  Matrix lets me choose.<p>And I can choose my homeserver or run my own.  Can you run your own Discord server (actual server)?<p>The only significant appeal I see for Discord is the existing user base.  Well, that didn&#x27;t save AOL.  I guess we&#x27;ll see how it turns out.\n\n            &gt; You could say the same thing about any specification that involved multiple features.<p>You could, which is why I find APIs like Discord&#x27;s easier to program for.<p>&gt; So is HTML.<p>Web dev had a certain reputation, partially because of that.<p>&gt; Is the same not true for Discord?<p>Discord sure has a bunch of weird format options, but the core messaging API hasn&#x27;t changed significantly in years as far as I can tell. You have text messages, sometimes with attachments, and that&#x27;s about it. Even the base structure of usernames changing has been backwards compatible without API changes.<p>&gt;  Destructuring incoming data is probably the easiest part of writing a messaging client.<p>That depends on the structure of the data, really.<p>&gt; I use unencrypted 1:1 chats as well<p>That does make things easier. But I don&#x27;t. A fancy GTK version of Cinny would he completely useless to me without basic encryption support. I still run into encryption bugs from time to time using multiple types of client.<p>&gt; And I can choose my homeserver or run my own. Can you run your own Discord server (actual server)?<p>So do I! And I can&#x27;t, obviously. But realistically, who cares? The Venn diagram between &quot;people who want to be able to run their own server&quot; and &quot;people I know who know how to install Arch&quot; is pretty much a single circle.<p>I want Matrix&#x2F;XMPP&#x2F;the Fediverse to succeed, but nobody but technology enthusiasts seems to care about any of this. A chat service I can use to talk to developers and fellow server admins is great in its own right, but it&#x27;s not a replacement for Discord where the normal people hang out.<p>From what I can tell, dissent is built in a way that shouldn&#x27;t make it too hard to convert into a Matrix client. You&#x27;ll need to fight with Spaces to get the &quot;Discord server&quot; concept across, though. For the people who don&#x27;t want to use Discord, most of the work is there. All you need is to grab a Matrix library for go (gomatrix died a month ago so you&#x27;d need to fork&#x2F;vendor that I guess?) and rework the data store.<p>I think my biggest issue with Matrix is mostly the status of most existing libraries. Many of them are outdated, partially cover the stack, and there&#x27;s not a lot of info on how to use them. Libraries get partially developed, and then abandoned for various reasons.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s rather annoying to work with is the way Matrix deals with things like emoji reactions and state. Everything is one big additive list of messages that needs to be read completely to get a proper view of the room.<p>Whatever the exact reasons may be, I had an easier experience writing a small Discord client than I had writing a small Matrix client. Matrix can be as easy as Discord, but only if you don&#x27;t try to do anything more complex than an IRC client.\n\n            &gt; You could say the same thing about any specification that involved multiple features.<p>You could, which is why I find APIs like Discord&#x27;s easier to program for.<p>&gt; So is HTML.<p>Web dev had a certain reputation, partially because of that.<p>&gt; Is the same not true for Discord?<p>Discord sure has a bunch of weird format options, but the core messaging API hasn&#x27;t changed significantly in years as far as I can tell.

Many of them are outdated, partially cover the stack, and there&#x27;s not a lot of info on how to use them. Libraries get partially developed, and then abandoned for various reasons. Because of this, it&#x27;s easier to maintain your own data model code rather than reusing existing work.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s rather annoying to work with is the way Matrix deals with things like emoji reactions and state. Everything is one big additive list of messages that needs to be read completely to get a proper view of the room.<p>Whatever the exact reasons may be, I had an easier experience writing a small Discord client than I had writing a small Matrix client. Perhaps my expectations were simply too high.\n\n        With all due respect but<p>&gt; This is also optional.<p>If you are making a client for anyone besides yourself at some point people will expect to be able to use one of the many &quot;optional&quot; features. At that point it doesn&#x27;t matter if you technically don&#x27;t need to support it as users will then simply see it as a shortcoming of your client.<p>So if we are talking about anything more than a MVP client these optional specs should be included in the argument as only being optional in theory.\n\n    Hi, developer here! I have worked on a Matrix client before (diamondburned&#x2F;gotktrix)! I abandoned it because I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to handle E2EE or rewrite it in a different Matrix library, but Fractal is also fairly stable now and it scratches the same itch, so I didn&#x27;t see a point.\n\n    Everyone says &quot;Discord bad&quot; (and I agree, it has issues) but few bother to understand and learn about what makes it successful and makes people use it (even in spite of its badness).<p>Alternatives bring in their own set of issues and generally focus on technicalities rather than delivering a good Discord&#x2F;etc competitor, so nobody uses them.<p>Do you want to chat with people or do you want to waste time dealing with protocol fragmentation, half-baked clients (or no clients at all), fundamental protocol-level flaws (that can&#x27;t be fixed without effectively starting from scratch on a new protocol), etc? Most people pick the first option and then tolerate the badness of Discord as a necessary evil.\n\n  I wonder if there are open source Discord server impls around that could help making a switch from the walled garden?<p>maybe this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spacebarchat&#x2F;spacebarchat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spacebarchat&#x2F;spacebarchat</a>\n\n    In that case you might as well use other options like Mattermost, Rocket.chat or of course the Matrix route.\n\n      No sane voice support.\n\n        why do you need voice support?<p>&amp; is there no lower-level solution? IE why do you need your discord client to do voice transcription?\n\n          Because people like to talk to each other sometimes.<p>And voice channels are a convenient feature people prefer rather than handling yet another tool with its own idiosyncrasies.<p>And voice is not enough, it also needs video and screen sharing. It all needs to be &quot;free&quot; (AKA someone else pay for it) too, or people will keep using Discord.<p>People should also be able to create their own servers without worrying about technical details, and again, without directly paying for it.<p>That&#x27;s how high the bar is.\n\n            doh, I forgot about voice chat.<p>&gt; People should also be able to create their own servers without worrying about technical details, and again, without directly paying for it.<p>I think this is the real reason why Discord is so ubiquitous nowadays. I remember back in 2017&#x2F;18, it was really only (PC) gamers who used Discord - because your average PC gamer is somewhat more tech literate than the general. Nowadays, every community and their mother has a Discord server.\n\n        <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mumble.info&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mumble.info&#x2F;</a> works for voice.\n\n          True, but has a shitty chat interface.\n\n        Yeah fair if you do require an all in one solution. It honestly didn&#x27;t occur to me as I rarely use voice on Discord.\n\n        Mattermost supports voice calls now.\n\n          Calls are not enough.\n\n      You can&#x27;t reach Discord users that way.\n\n  Apparently, the developers of Dissent have never read Discord&#x27;s Terms of Service, because it doesn&#x27;t even mention third-party clients.\n\n    I just read all of the ToS and also didn&#x27;t find anything which disallows third party clients. I did find some older references to it on Google. Perhaps they changed the rule?\n\n      No, it was never there. Some people assumed it was, said it out loud, and it spread like a meme (as in the original meaning of the word.)\n\n    After a quick look at their ToS I too do not see a clear mention.<p>In a previous HN discussion from September 2021:<p>&gt; [zorkian] <i>It&#x27;s still against the TOS -- my point is only that we don&#x27;t specifically look for third party client users and we have no specific plans to do so.</i><p>[Note zorkian’s HN profile: “VP, Core Tech @ Discord. Opinions are my own and I do not speak for my employer (unless noted explicitly.)”]<p>&gt; [tumult] Just curious -- where in the TOS are third party clients forbidden? I&#x27;ve read it a few times, and I&#x27;m not seeing it.<p>&gt; [dge2020] Probably:<p>&gt; <i>You agree not to (and not to attempt to) (i) use the Service for any use or purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms;(ii) copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, attempt to discover any source code, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise exploit the Service or any portion of the Service, except as expressly permitted in these Terms;</i><p>&gt; It&#x27;s a catch-all but the best restriction that prevents third-party clients is probably &#x27;prepare derivative works based on&#x27; and &#x27;reverse engineer&#x27; (which you would need if you want your third party client to use any regular client API calls, or if you want to support signing in with the user-facing login page&#x2F;qr login).<p>&gt; [tumult] A third party client like Ripcord isn&#x27;t a derivative work. It also wasn&#x27;t made by reverse engineering any of Discord&#x27;s code. Even if it were, these rules still wouldn&#x27;t apply to using third party clients.<p>So it seems that, as you note, the ToS do not explicitly mention third-party clients but Discord themselves believe that it forbids third-party clients.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28435490\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28435490</a>\n\n    I&#x27;m actually fully aware of this! Discord&#x27;s ToS just says they can ban you for any reason, and it also touches on API abuse. A lot of past Discord clients (e.g. cordless) don&#x27;t try to minimize API calls (especially some sensitive ones), and some of that counted towards API abuse.<p>Dissent tries to minimize API calls by requesting information over the Gateway Websocket and caching them instead. This is actually what the official client does!<p>It&#x27;s just way easier to say that it violates the ToS instead of explaining the whole deal, though. You might still get banned, use it at your own risk.\n\n  Why are companies like Discord, Slack, Reddit etc. so hellbent on having users stick to their god awful front end clients? You can easily perform all the data harvesting you want on the backend. Just provide some open-source api clients, and let the community build the UIs they want.\n\n    They have it in their hands to display inbound advertisment?\n\n    i suppose because of engagement metrics\n\n    Because they want complete control over your experience.\n\n    It tarnishes their grand &#x27;vision&#x27; for the user experience.\n\n    Why are users, especially technically-inclined ones, hellbent on using these proprietary services? Throw them all out if they are going to be this way since there are <i>great</i> alternatives. The last thing communities should do is build UIs around these types of services instead of building ones for systems&#x2F;services that aren’t so hostile towards users.\n\n      &gt; Why are users, especially technically-inclined ones, hellbent on using these proprietary services?<p>Because that&#x27;s where people are.\n\n        &gt; Why do you rob banks?<p>&gt; Because that’s where the money is<p>— Willie Sutton, career bank robber, caught 11 times<p>Perhaps there’s a better solution out there\n\n          Analogous to the metaphor you just made, the &quot;better solution&quot; is not talking to people. I&#x27;m all-for open and secure communication protocols, but the layman isn&#x27;t going to agree if you cast it as an all-or-nothing mentality.\n\n            You can a) set up a gateway&#x2F;bridge or b) contribute to those platforms to make them better so users like them <i>more</i> as the open+secure options are more worth the long-term investment into instead of making users choose between privacy&#x2F;security or having the ability to communicate.\n\n              For 99% of normal people, neither A nor B is something they are capable of. If the success of free alternatives is contingent on this behavior, we might as well throw in the towel now.<p>If the average Discord user read your comment, I think it would reaffirm their assumption that free Discord alternatives aren&#x27;t for them.\n\n                Versus myself that would see that there is a security&#x2F;privacy concern &amp; would immediately see if I can use an alternative.\n\n      &gt; since there are great alternatives<p>No. There aren’t.\n\n    Control over premium features. Which in a sense is valid, I rather have a product supported by people paying for premium features than a product that runs on ads or only does exist by the grace of venture capital.<p>Of course some premium features can be controlled server side, but not all of them.<p>For example, the extended message limit can quite easily be done by a custom client by splitting up the message. \nSimilar for custom color themes.<p>Having said all that, in the case of Discord I honestly don&#x27;t think they need to lock down third party clients for this. As most Nitro features are mostly server side anyway.\n\n&gt; still no x-super-properties use<p>Unsafe. \nDiscord uses the aforementioned header for client identification for certain endpoints. Lack of usage of this header is dangerous.\n\n  Could you elaborate? What exactly is in that header and what&#x27;s dangerous about not passing it?\n\n  Hi, Dissent actually makes no effort to try and hide itself from Discord! In fact, API calls via Dissent have their User-Agent header set to &quot;Dissent (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libdb.so&#x2F;dissent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libdb.so&#x2F;dissent</a>)&quot; to emphasize the fact that they&#x27;re NOT performed by the official client.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28435490\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28435490</a> goes into this, but Discord doesn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> care if you use a third-party client. They only care if said client misuses the API, and that happens to include a lot of past clients. I&#x27;ve been developing a handful of Discord clients for several years now and have never had my account banned, but I have a backup account just in case this scenario happens.<p>Of course, people may still be banned for using Dissent, so use it at your own risk.\n\n    You&#x27;re misusing the API by not following what headers are used by Discord itself, so this comes off as fairly irresponsible. 2021 was a long time ago, so I wouldn&#x27;t take anything said there as accurate to current times.\n\nThis would be great if it supported voice calls.\n\nHmmm... I don&#x27;t use Discord a lot, but (depending on how resource intensive this app is) I wish someone would combine this with <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpbruinsslot&#x2F;slack-term\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpbruinsslot&#x2F;slack-term</a> into a lightweight Slack client. Not sure about how Slack&#x27;s policy regarding unofficial clients is though...\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revolt.chat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revolt.chat&#x2F;</a> looks like a good alternative to Discord.\n\n  Wow, did not know about this, looks like a really good alternative to Discord!\n\n  Is there a list of features that Revolt has?\nI was unable to find this on their website or at a glance at their Github page.\n\nWarning: alternative Discord clients will get you banned. I got my account permanently banned for no other reason other than using a 3rd party client, even though it (Ripcord) had insanely better UX.\n\n  Its so sad, that Discord is too small that the DMA kicks in and they would be forced to allow third party software.\n\n    This is a community of Tech enthusiasts and yet, so many entertain this party of leopards eating people&#x27;s faces by accepting anything less than open federated&#x2F;P2P protocols.<p>And so far, the DMA has only served to show malicious compliance on the side of Facebook. Nothing to better the lives of those who reject the walled gardens.\n\n      I don&#x27;t want to speculate why this is the case, but tech enthusiasts rarely have the social capital that it takes to move friend groups or local forums over to specific platforms.<p>The sad reality is that we can either accept the monopolizing forces like everyone else, or make ourselves apart from important social contexts.\n\n      &gt; This is a community of Tech enthusiasts<p>Eh no, I’d say it’s precisely the subset of tech enthusiasts who aspire to work for a profitable company like discord, or even build one. There are a few of us here who reject corporate tech, but i don’t think it’s the majority.\n\n      I like to use Mumble <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mumble.info&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mumble.info&#x2F;</a> for voice chat while gaming. It&#x27;s really effective at voice chat and runs on a toaster. The server was really easy to set up on my raspberry pi. Is there another software that might be helpful that you can think of? Free software would be preferable\n\n  They also do very, very little in terms of personal data protection.\n\n    Which is often related - there&#x27;s no way to batch delete your data, trying to do so with third-party tooling could get you banned, and once you&#x27;re banned you can&#x27;t delete it. In fact, you can&#x27;t even delete messages from channels that an ordinary user has kicked you out of. And IIRC banned accounts still have unique public identifiers, so any PII can still be correlated (as opposed to the [deleted] pseudononymization that Reddit does)\n\n  I used cordless exclusively.  I too got my main account banned as part of the initial round where they did this.\n\n    When was that? It&#x27;s a shame that they seem to have changed positions in the past few years<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28438440\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28438440</a>\n\n      Early 2021, as shortly after the dev shut down cordless.<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve actually reversed position at all.  I think the bottom line is they don&#x27;t like anything that isn&#x27;t their client because they can&#x27;t pump nitro at you.<p>And considering part of their TOS is basically they can do whatever they want, I don&#x27;t know why people would even risk it anymore.\n\nMore people choose to make clients for a proprietary services that will ban people for using them or even invent their own protocol than people choose to make clients for Matrix. This should worry the Matrix folks.\n\n  i&#x27;d never heard of matrix until now, and i had to search for it on two different search engines before i eventually found it (very far down on the list of results).<p>after briefly scanning their website, i don&#x27;t get it. there are multiple providers you can create an account with and multiple clients? is this for direct messaging to individuals or are there &quot;rooms&quot;? can accounts on different providers talk to each other? how do i know which provider i should sign up with?<p>these are mostly rhetorical questions because i&#x27;ve already lost interest and all of my online friends are already on discord. but the experience i just had is what they should be worried about imo.\n\n    It&#x27;s fediverse but for chat. It has group chats, but netsplits somehow behave even worse than they do on IRC and if you join public ones you&#x27;ll get sent extremely unwanted images by bots on a regular basis.<p>There are a million clients because the official one has horrible UX and everyone thinks they can make a better one.<p>I know quite a few people who think it&#x27;s the future of chat but every time I&#x27;ve tried to use it I&#x27;ve ended up having a bad time. I&#x27;d advise against trying personally.\n\n      I&#x27;m wearing a Matrix T-Shirt right now and can&#x27;t disagree much about the experience not being great.<p>&gt; There are a million clients because the official one has horrible UX and everyone thinks they can make a better one.<p>I wish. My experience is that there are <i>few</i> clients and a lot of them have similarly ... beginner-unfriendly UX due to the SDKs, the protocol itself and cultural factors (there seems to be a good amount of &quot;this is good enough&quot;&#x2F;&quot;you don&#x27;t actually need that&quot; hubris in the community).<p>Matrix, besides XMPP, is the only federated chat protocol with any kind of traction, so I figure that it makes sense to invest in improving it rather than building something new. Ideally using it would be a no-brainer choice for delivering chat apps: Why would you invent something new when you could use a protocol that already exists and already has a vast ecosystem of libraries and users? That&#x27;s where I wish it was, reality unfortunately looks quite different.\n\n        &gt; Why would you invent something new when you could use a protocol that already exists and already has a vast ecosystem of libraries and users?<p>Unfortunately that&#x27;s exactly what Matrix did, and people keep repeating the same mistake. Just this week, i was seeing a new federated IM protocol whose main selling point is &quot;not XMPP&#x2F;Matrix&quot;:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tinode&#x2F;chat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tinode&#x2F;chat</a><p>If only these Matrix&#x2F;Tinode people spent their energy on making a decent XMPP client, Discord would not even be born. Alas, my interpretation is it&#x27;s a hard-sell to investors to make a client for an existing network and these devs want to put bread on their tables.\n\n          i mean it is also totally fair enough to just make another version of something that already exists for the sake of it, making things is fun and that&#x27;s a good enough reason imo.<p>personally i&#x27;m really not a fan of the &quot;x already exists so everybody should always use that and nobody should ever spend time making a different one&quot; school of thought that seems to be so prevalent here. i just think it goes without saying that if their thing isn&#x27;t obviously better and easy to adopt, it probably won&#x27;t gain any traction.\n\nI have tried quite a lot of alternative discord clients, my favorite is still Abaddon[0]. It works great, and its UI is fonctionnal enough for my needs.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uowuo&#x2F;abaddon\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uowuo&#x2F;abaddon</a>\n\nI simply wanted to write a user bot which reads messages from a channel (to write them to another messenger). After reading tos it seems to be a reason to get a ban, but did this ever happen for simply reading? I bet this stuff only triggers on actions.\n\n  they actually provide a pretty complete bot api that&#x27;s perfect for what you want to do. since it&#x27;s a bot api, the &quot;user&quot; will appear as a bot in discord clients, and a few restrictions will apply (e.g. bots cannot interact with each other). but for simply reading a channel, it&#x27;s pretty trivial to do.<p>I did use it in the past using the Rust library Serenity [0] (unofficial library ofc) to make a geoguesser-like bot [1] for a private server with friends. Pretty simple to use actually! Do note they have some pretty harsh ratelimits when it comes to API calls though, so pay attention to caching when fetching data (not likely to be an issue for your usecase at it&#x27;ll mostly be server-sent events.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;latest&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;latest&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tuetuopay&#x2F;bot-ticelli\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tuetuopay&#x2F;bot-ticelli</a> (don&#x27;t judge, this was thrown together between amongus games during lockdown)\n\n    I know about the bot api, but I want to use that as a user account.\n\n      I don&#x27;t get why you would want that but what do i know :DI<p>Indeed since clients have a websocket connection to stream incoming messages, it should be nigh indistinguishable for them from a regular clients.<p>Also, the API abuse they are worried about is spam and scams, so just pulling out messages is likely to be the last of their problems.\n\n        I mean that’s kinda the same as the linked project Dissent - they also use a user account. That’s why I thought about it that way.\n\nThis looks like a very slick project and might just use it. GG!<p>Any chance something similar exists for slack? The discord client is not that much of a pain, but slack you have to pick between a client that OOMs the machine, and a browser tab that OOMs the browser.\n\nWhat perfect timing, I started going down the GJS (Javascript) route for a custom app. Maybe it&#x27;s time to build a Go + templ like package w&#x2F; GTK4 widgets.\n\n&gt; Using an unofficial client at all is against Discord&#x27;s Terms of Service and may cause your account to be banned!<p>Remind me again, why do people still use this garbage?"

Hopefully Cranelift lands in stable at some point.\n\n  That’s pretty good. Our frontend app built with TS with SWC recompiles in about that time.\n\n    Depends on the code size though. Is this 1k lines? 10k lines? 100k lines?<p>Just looking at the blog this seems like a fully static site that should be able to be built in milliseconds. Some input from the developer here on what takes all this time would be interesting.\n\nTheir benchmarks are based on a machine with 72GB of RAM and another with 128GB of RAM - not that it does matter, but I&#x27;m really curious if they&#x27;re outliers or if I should bump my computer specs. That&#x27;s a lot of Electron web apps running in parallel!\n\n  Some people need it, some don&#x27;t. When I upgraded to a 7950X I was unable to find an excuse to buy more than 32GB. &quot;That one time a script compiled clang by default with LTO and OOMed&quot; was not a good enough reason.<p>If you use a lot of VMs, it comes in handy. If you do a lot of heavyweight compilation in parallel, same thing. But at least on Linux, popping 3 VS Code projects and 4 more browsers doesn&#x27;t even hit 50% utilization.\n\n    Funnily enough, RAM I find I can use no matter how much I have, especially now that you have LLMs. I can run a quantised Mixtral 8x7B on 64GB RAM.<p>But the 7950X is grossly underutilised, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.\n\n      Shouldn&#x27;t the quantized LLMs be using the CPU to good effect? I&#x27;d imagine your Mixtral is substantially faster than it would be on a weaker CPU.\n\n        I have a 4080 with 16GB of VRAM. I experimented with llama.cpp by offloading layers onto GPU and doing the remaining on CPU. I found that it gives me max tokens&#x2F;sec if I set it to 8 CPU cores as opposed to the 16 available on the 7950X. I guess beyond that, the bookkeeping between the cores might be taking up more time than it is worth.\n\n      the answer i found is run gentoo and compile yocto projects.\n\n    Yea, very workload dependent. Reposurgeon needed hundreds of gigabytes of ram to convert the GCC repository from SVN to Git, which was a lot of fun, but most of the time I would be fine with 32GB.\n\n    You can try running tests in parallel with the memory sanitizer (MSAN) enabled. MSAN uses a lot of memory, and on a 64 GB machine I have to reduce the amount of parallelism not to trigger Linux OoM killer.<p><pre><code>    MSAN: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;sanitizers&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MemorySanitizer</code></pre>\n\n  My understanding is that processor performance is more important for rust compilation than available memory, but ultimately the atrocious compilation times are why I struggled so much with Rust.\n\n  Definitely outliers. The Steam hardware survey [0] is obviously not a perfect measurement, but in its February results only ~3% had 64GB and only ~0.3% had more than that.<p>I recently upgraded to 64GB to run quantized LLM models, but when I&#x27;m not using an LLM I rarely use more than 16GB, much less 32GB.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;hwsurvey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;hwsurvey</a>\n\n    I have 32GB on my Linux laptop (plus 12GB swap) and regularly run out of RAM with just a handful of VSCode&#x27;s open (it&#x27;s generally the language servers using all the RAM) and a couple of dozen Firefox tabs (Firefox seems to be much worse than Chrome RAM-wise). If I run my actual work project, which needs a few gigs then it often just completely runs out of memory and hard reboots.<p>Never have the same problem on Windows even though I only have 16GB there. Feels like Linux is just really bad at memory management. That may be skewing the Steam survey since almost everyone there will be using Windows.<p>On Linux I wish I had 64GB.\n\n      Have you tried zram for instance? There are a lot of things one can do to better utilise RAM on Linux.<p>I believe Fedora comes ootb with a lot of things to make ram management quite good. Using another distro these days, but Fedora impressed me on that front.<p>(edit: Try to use zram and zswap, check if your i&#x2F;o scheduler is correct for your hardware, and increase your swapiness value. These should make your system behave better. For other performance improvements, use ananicy and irqbalance.)\n\n        Yes I have zram enabled. First thing I tried.<p>Even if it is possible to fix this, it&#x27;s still a horrible bug because you absolutely should not have to blindly tweak settings to stop a desktop computer from hard-rebooting when it runs out of RAM.<p>I think this is a really fundamental problem on Linux though - it would require enormous changes and unprecedented cooperation between different groups for a proper fix. Much easier to say &quot;you&#x27;re holding it wrong&quot;.\n\n          Sounds like you need some swap (?)\n\n      Set your swap to double your RAM. Windows has a swap file that grows as much as it needs to.\n\n        I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t. Windows lets you set the swap size limit. The biggest difference is that Windows doesn&#x27;t over-commit, so you <i>need</i> a big swap file otherwise you&#x27;ll be running out of memory all the time even before you actually use all your physical RAM.\n\n      You might just be misunderstanding Linux&#x27;s RAM management strategy. Do you actually start getting out of memory errors, or do you see &quot;free&quot; memory rapidly go to zero?<p>If it&#x27;s the latter, that&#x27;s because Linux deliberately uses as much RAM as possible for caches and such, which means &quot;free&quot; <i>should</i> be near zero most of the time. The number that actually matters on Linux is &quot;available&quot; memory, which is the amount of memory that is currently free <i>or</i> used for optional caches and could be reallocated for a new required chunk of RAM should an application need it. Here [0] is a decent in-depth explanation.<p>If it&#x27;s the former, there&#x27;s something very wrong with your installation, because every Linux system I have makes <i>much</i> better usage of memory than Windows, even running a heavyweight DE like KDE. Even my machine that dual-boots Linux and Windows performs noticeably better on all metrics (including memory usage) when in Linux.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxblog.io&#x2F;free-vs-available-memory-in-linux&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxblog.io&#x2F;free-vs-available-memory-in-linux&#x2F;</a>\n\n  I benchmarked Rusts performance on 2, 4, 8 and 16 cores on several widely used crates (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arewefastyet.pages.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arewefastyet.pages.dev&#x2F;</a>). Performance generally improved with the number of cores, but memory made no difference. All of these crates topped out at around 1GB and additional memory didn’t improve performance.<p>So no, 72GB or 128GB makes no difference.\n\n    Yes, maybe I didn&#x27;t make it clear but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not impacting for Rust. I was just wondering if it&#x27;s normal to have these specs since my computer has probably &quot;just&quot; 32GB of RAM\n\n    I agree that memory size isn&#x27;t going to matter much, but memory speed should be noticeable, especially on large projects.\n\n  If you are like me and opening too many browser tabs (and other applications, of course), you need a lot of RAM. My desktop has <i>only</i> 48 GB of RAM right now and a typical VM usage is around 80--100 GB. I will probably go for 128 GB or possibly 192 GB of RAM for the next desktop.<p>Rust builds, in comparison, don&#x27;t actually reach that far, mainly because it is proportional to the maximum number of parallel jobs. In my experience, 48 GB was more than plenty for 8 parallel jobs if I wasn&#x27;t doing anything else.\n\n&gt; Note: Discord User @PaulH(and a couple others) let me know about this bug that prevents the server build from using the dependencies built for the previous compilation of the server&#x2F;webassembly frontend build due to changes in the RUSTFLAGS.

But it reloads with errors included.<p>The primary benefit of the rust compiler, at least from my point of view, is telling me what&#x27;s wrong, where.

I waited and waited for a Surface Laptop that has 32gb on ebay. When it came, price skyrocket to almost double the 16gb model. Twice more it happened and I literally gave up and bought the 16gb. I don&#x27;t know what the retail premium from Microsoft is, but the reseller premium is truly insanity. Surely, Microsoft spent the time engineering it to fit 32gb and could reap more producing more of them.\n\n        I have the 2022 model of this machine [1] which is a macBook Pro clone from Xiaomi.<p>It&#x27;s an absolute beast, build quality is almost on par with Apple (screen is better than what Apple offered in 2022, actually) and the 32GB RAM base model from this year can be had for less than 1,000€.<p>I dunno where the &quot;destruction of your wallet&quot; threshold lies for you but for me it&#x27;s way higher.<p>The 2022 version also used Ryzen APUs and there is excellent Linux support.\nIt&#x27;s my daily driver for Rust development (I run Pop!_OS on it).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a.aliexpress.com&#x2F;_EygTDml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a.aliexpress.com&#x2F;_EygTDml</a>\n\n          &quot;But for me it&#x27;s way higher&quot;<p>Point not comprehended.\n\n          I’m really not wild about buying a Xiaomi laptop (even though my understanding is Xiaomis stuff is all well engineered etc). People will point to the NSA doing shit but I have fairly little faith in Xiaomi devices (especially ones heading towards foreign addresses) not having nasty secret backdoors.<p>There is a bit of a qualitative distinction between the Lenovo backdoor stuff and that. But that’s just my personal threat model\n\n        I recently upgraded my gaming laptop to 32GB DDR4 for very cheap. It doesn’t destroy the wallet if the ram isn’t soldered and you can easily replace it. I paid about 75€ with taxes for two sticks of 16GB. I wouldn’t recommend gaming laptops as laptops though. They are terrible laptops.\n\n          How much was the gaming laptop itself though? I’m sure you can make this work of course, just curious about the base machine price\n\n            About 2000€ I think. But you can probably find a gaming laptop around 1000€ that is easy to upgrade to 32GB.\n\n        What? Laptop + 32G RAM is Laptop + 100€. With a refurbished thinkpad you can get reasonable compile times for as little as 600€.<p>Stop buying macbooks if you want lots of RAM and performance for a low price.\n\n    This has definitely be one big reason for me why I did not get into rust. I don’t want to have to buy a new machine just to get the compile times I’m used to\n\n  &gt; The primary benefit of the rust compiler, at least from my point of view, is telling me what&#x27;s wrong, where.<p>Incredible! Rust developers have invented &quot;IDEs&quot;!\n\n    I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re familiar with front-end developer tooling or the development process, but my editor will not tell me what error a browser is going to throw.\n\n      &gt; but my editor will not tell me what error a browser is going to throw<p>And so won&#x27;t Rust, a runtime error is a runtime error after all.<p>But even Typescript has pretty good control flow analysis which catches a lot of (what would be) JS runtime errors while typing when properly integrated with an IDE.<p>It&#x27;s not like Rust invented static typing, it just has a very strong type system (which can quickly become an annoyance though, that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a wide range of &#x27;strictness&#x27; among statically typed languages, because while static typing is generally a good thing, a &#x27;too strong&#x27; type system might not be.\n\n        Somehow I see a trend on developers educated in scripting languages and using either Go or Rust as their first compiled languages.<p>Apparently they invented static linking, pattern matching, structural typing, unsafe keyword, and plenty of other stuff already present on compiler toolchains and type systems that predate them...<p>I wonder if we will ever sort out the issue of developers caring about programing language history, or operating systems for that matter.<p>I mean in the wider sense, not the geeky community that already does that as a hobby.\n\n    Your sarcasm missed the mark. You meant &quot;static typing&quot;.\n\n  You’re a front end developer but you don’t need to make small tweaks all the time? “At the end of addressing all of the obvious errors, I have something that works.” is irrelevant to large swaths of front end code, which is basically always in a “working” state (displays something without error), but needs to be continuously expanded and refined.<p>TFA talks about reload times of 20-30s before their optimization, on a powerful computer. It’s certainly not “a few seconds” especially for people on less powerful hardware. That’s a ridiculous wait time for, say, tweaking a CSS class.<p>I find this comment highly suspect.\n\n    JavaScript errors only occur at runtime. It&#x27;s very common, especially in legacy codebases, for issues to just fly under the radar, even if they are obvious to the seasoned dev. There is a reason why one of the most popular JS books is called &#x27;Javascript: the good parts&#x27;.<p>With rust, it&#x27;s very refreshing in that it&#x27;s idiot proof, which JavaScript is not. \nCSS is not relevant, since it is not actual programming.\n\n      We (at least the author and I) are talking about front end development here where most reloads are tweaking markup and stylesheets and shouldn’t introduce any error. And half a minute or longer reloads are unacceptable for those.<p>I don’t need a lecture on the history of JavaScript, thank you. Especially since JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript has come such a long way that JavaScript the Good Parts is barely relevant anymore.<p>&gt; Rust… idiot proof<p>That’s such a… interesting statement that I’m not going to respond further.\n\n      CSS is actual programming. Nevertheless, he was just stating a common case where one iteratively checks if their assumptions, even if carefully accounted for, conform to their expectations.<p>Another, very real &quot;programming&quot; situation could be the following: correctly parsing 3D mesh information in a multithreaded fashion and pass that to your preferred API of choice. Is one going to get all edge cases right the first time? Is your program&#x27;s codebase large enough? Eventually it becomes kinda yucky having to wait.<p>The compiler may know what is programmatically correct, not what your intention is. I think that&#x27;s what the other person was trying to argue.<p>I&#x27;m not too concerned about compile times myself, I&#x27;m used to them given I mostly dabble with compiled languages (I do a lot of CSS though!), but there&#x27;s a argument to be made about iteration time and being fast in solving a problem.\n\n  I benchmarked Rusts performance on 2, 4, 8 and 16 cores on several widely used crates (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arewefastyet.pages.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arewefastyet.pages.dev&#x2F;</a>). Performance generally improved with the number of cores, but memory made no difference. All of these crates topped out at around 1GB and additional memory didn’t improve performance.<p>So no, 72GB or 128GB makes no difference.\n\n  Working on a couple of ideas that flip that logic on its head, but you’re more likely to be right because of finite time.<p>The thing about rust is that the overhead is all upfront.<p>Not to be sacrilegious, but bleeding at the move or &amp;wtf borrow boundary is a price one pays to have confidence, subsequently.<p>Your cms&#x2F;customer acronym probably doesn’t need it, but you’ll love the —fast option in some stacks that merely means “compile the rust extension.”<p>Plus… it’s a gainful hobby. I’m fine if other people have hobbies that don’t resemble x86 in 1998 on slackware ;)\n\n    I will never understand who hated my innocent and light-hearted thought that much. Hope it was worth making me go, “aw” for no reason.\n\n  People are impatient. I expect in a few years someone will”solve” this problem by removing the borrow checker and then by removing the unsafe keyword, then allowing dynamic linking and shared libraries…. And this person will be lauded as a genius. And some group of cranky bitters will make a new language with a new borrow checker,,,, cycle repeats\n\n    The borrow checker is not responsible for even 1% of compilation time.<p>The elephant in the room is monomorphisation and macro expansion. Those generate a ton of code that LLVM has to process. In return you get much faster programs at runtime.\n\nThe coolest thing about this to me IMO is the comparison between the two CPUs.<p>Is there a project that publishes benchmarks compiling projects across different CPUs? I know passmark is kinda the go-to but this would be cool.<p>Someday I&#x27;ll feel the need to upgrade from a 2700x...\n\n  Phoronix does a lot of CPU benchmarks, including code compilation, but mostly focused on Linux. More result are also available in the OpenBenchmark page, which is also part of the same project. Take a look at the timed compilation test-suit: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbenchmarking.org&#x2F;suite&#x2F;pts&#x2F;compilation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbenchmarking.org&#x2F;suite&#x2F;pts&#x2F;compilation</a>\n\n  Have you looked at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbenchmarking.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbenchmarking.org</a>?\n\n    I haven&#x27;t, thanks!\n\nSuper interesting! I would have loved to see included in the potential solutions the use of sccache too\n\nLooking at some benchmarks online and the 7900x always beat the 5950x even though the 5950x has more cores.<p>But in this article the 7900x performed worse than the 5950x, is it because of the core count, or are there some other factors?\n\nFirst time I hear about mold.<p>The performance looks good, but are there any plans for any other improvements such as LTO?\n\n  mold supports LTO out of the box.\n\nI really wish people wouldn&#x27;t use AI-generated images for blog posts, it&#x27;s so distracting! I clicked the link wanting to read the article, but instead spent several minutes looking at the image to find errors: what&#x27;s shown on the screen (apparently it&#x27;s &quot;Jot Commeditin&quot;) looks like something between a hex dump, git blame, and occult incantations written in a long-forgotten alphabet. Probably you need a keyboard like the one on the desk (with keys arranged in a fractal pattern) to write something like that. And a mouse with a cable going nowhere...\n\n  He got three out of four of “manic pixie dream girl”\n\n  I did the same! Then didn&#x27;t read the article.\n\n  Same, but what’s worse is that people never put in the caption that it’s AI nor what tool is used. Transparency goes a long way.\n\nFrom my experience, faster SSD have a suprising strong effect for some (simple) languages (probably not Rust), like Go [0]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octobench.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octobench.com&#x2F;</a>\n\nIs it an unpopular opinion to say 75% of “a lot” is still “a lot”, plus now you have to keep track of the knobs and constantly monitor for and be conscious about not wrecking build times as you’re maintaining and developing.<p>I’ve found in 10+ years of software development that speed of iteration cycle is highly correlated with productivity. Compile times is not the only input into this cycle time, but it’s a big one, and importantly, it’s within the control of the language tooling itself to solve. The human idle attention time of 1-2 seconds should be the gold standard to strive for, even if not always achievable.<p>There seems to be quite a bit of cope around Rust build times in the community, which was natural a few years ago (a lot of people used to “blame” llvm, but it doesn’t seem to be as big of a culprit) but things are different now, no? Given the maturity, growing ecosystem and corporate investment, I would expect incremental build speedup to be prioritized, and steadily improving. But clearly it isn’t moving very fast in that direction. So why not?\n\n  &gt; I’ve found in 10+ years of software development that speed of iteration cycle is highly correlated with productivity.<p>I agree, though in practice with many Rust programs that iteration cycle is actually <i>not</i> &quot;edit, compile, run&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;edit, save, wait for rust-analyzer to update&quot; which is generally much quicker (even if it is sometimes still a little slow).<p>In <i>most</i> cases, Rust&#x27;s very strong type system means you spend a lot less time actually running your program.<p>There are definitely exceptions though. E.g. if you&#x27;re making a web app and editing CSS or whatever then the Rust compiler isn&#x27;t going to tell you if you&#x27;ve got the colour wrong.<p>&gt; a lot of people used to “blame” llvm, but it doesn’t seem to be as big of a culprit<p>It still is; there was a post here really recently where someone broke down the time spent in various phases. LLVM is still the vast majority, though apparently that is partly due to Rust generating a lot of work for it.<p>&gt; I would expect incremental build speedup to be prioritized, and steadily improving.<p>It is.<p>&gt; But clearly it isn’t moving very fast in that direction. So why not?<p>Because Rust&#x27;s unit of compilation (a crate) is very large. In C&#x2F;C++ it&#x27;s a single file.\n\n    &gt; I agree, though in practice with many Rust programs that iteration cycle is actually not &quot;edit, compile, run&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;edit, save, wait for rust-analyzer to update&quot; which is generally much quicker (even if it is sometimes still a little slow).<p>This is one area that I think Dart did a good job on. They support both a JIT (I am not sure if it’s tiered) and AOT modes of compiling, the JIT targeted for development and AOT for production. This is the ultimate extreme of optimizing for both use cases, obviously it’s a ton of work, but I would love more languages to be like this. (I believe the JIT mode works directly on the source so there isn&#x27;t an intermediate compilation step like Java, but it’s been a few years since I’ve used Dart)<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dart.dev&#x2F;overview#native-platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dart.dev&#x2F;overview#native-platform</a>\n\n      I agree. And Dart&#x27;s VSCode extension is suspiciously fast. Like it accurately finds compile errors in easily 100ms. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done so differently to pretty much every other system, where you&#x27;re talking ~1-2s typically. It&#x27;s very nice though.\n\n      This is the best of both worlds, that traces back to Lisp and BASIC environments.<p>Have all variants available and allow the devs to pick the right one for their current workflow.<p>Java, .NET, Eiffel, Common Lisp, Scheme, C++ (via stuff like ROOT and Live++, VC++ hot reload isn&#x27;t that full proof), OCaml, Haskel, are all examples of these mixed tooling approach.\n\n    It is a single file, but when you include header files which get dropped in they can get to many hundreds of thousands of lines of code in practice per corresponding .o file.\n\n      But the level of parallelism possible is downright insane with C++ because of this property... once, out of anger at my build time on something I was working on back in 2016&#x2F;2017, I set up a AWS Lambda as a compilation server (fully generic: all it had was my toolchain, not the code in question or even the build scripts) for something akin to ccache and successfully managed to build my project with a pipeline (I use that word as I was still doing the preprocessing locally) of at least a hundred simultaneous jobs: good luck ever pulling that off with Rust.<p>It is also generally very easy to break apart any file or decouple any header files using various techniques that don&#x27;t affect your project layout or require any mental maintenance once done. In contrast, with Rust, you have to essentially refactor what your project even &quot;means&quot; to pull that off as you now need to be juggling a ton of microcrates (and then it seems like there is some inherent crate overhead so this becomes a painful tradeoff plane you need to optimize; compilation units have to become degenerated small before that matters in C++).<p>And, even then, the remaining slowest file in my insanely complex C++ project does tend to take a ridiculously long time to build (I have a 30-60 second long compile for one small component) and I have run out of low-hanging fruit; but, I honestly hardly ever actually have to build it: the coupling of header files is massively overstated as when you are in a tight build&#x2F;update cycle you are generally modifying a single function in a source code file, not changing some header file of basic data types that will affect the code generation of literally the entire rest of the project.<p>Like, I get it: thinking about code as a merged set of linear forward passes is sometimes annoying, but it doesn&#x27;t just enable massive gains in compile time... it also encourages more legitimate coupling between components as circular dependencies require extra code and upkeep for prototypes <i>and that&#x27;s good because circular dependencies are bad</i>. Rust thereby is doing something that frankly feels super awkward: it is elevating behavior that frankly makes more sense only within a single file or at best a single object to a project organizational unit, which suddenly makes this all seem much more complicated to handle correctly.\n\n    &gt; In most cases, Rust&#x27;s very strong type system means you spend a lot less time actually running your program.<p>That just sounds wrong to me TBH. IME it never pays off to &#x27;front-load&#x27; too much, you might get a working implementation of your original idea without ever running the code, but that original idea will almost certainly be &quot;wrong&quot; once you see it in action and you just wasted a lot of time agonizing over your type structure which turned out to implement a quickly outdated idea.<p>Nothing beats quick iteration on a running program when it comes to productivity.<p>&gt; Because Rust&#x27;s unit of compilation (a crate) is very large. In C&#x2F;C++ it&#x27;s a single file.<p>If the a C++ file includes any C++ stdlib header it will also also become very large (tens of thousands of lines of gnarly template code for common headers like &lt;vector&gt; or &lt;string&gt;). If the unit of compilation is a crate in Rust it should actually be faster to build than typical C++ projects which often put the implementation for one class into one source file (and each of those source files is expanded to tens of thousands of lines of code after includes are resolved).<p>C mostly doesn&#x27;t suffer from this problem though, since C header typically are only a couple dozen or hundred lines of API declarations.\n\n      &gt; If the a C++ file includes any C++ stdlib header it will also also become very large (tens of thousands of lines of gnarly template code for common headers like &lt;vector&gt; or &lt;string&gt;). If the unit of compilation is a crate in Rust it should actually be faster to build than typical C++ projects which often put the implementation for one class into one source file (and each of those source files is expanded to tens of thousands of lines of code after includes are resolved).<p>&gt; C mostly doesn&#x27;t suffer from this problem though, since C header typically are only a couple dozen or hundred lines of API declarations.<p>But then, there&#x27;s no reason why Rust couldn&#x27;t be like C. The issue comes from the dependencies and libraries bundled, which is not an issue <i>per se</i> of the language.\n\n      This sounds overblown to me, TBH. IME you hardly need to agonize over type structure for common day to day code. The benefits of the type system are highly advantageous to refactoring without causing breakage, so I become more nimble in getting towards the proper structure. This is precisely what allows me to iterate more quickly and is a benefit.\n\n      I had lots of coffee pauses when doing builds back in 2000, where our C bindings for the Tcl based server, used as Apache and IIS modules, across Aix, HP-UX, Solaris, Windows 2000&#x2F;NT, Red-Hat Linux would take one hour per platform on average.\n\n    &gt; in practice with many Rust programs that iteration cycle is actually not &quot;edit, compile, run&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;edit, save, wait for rust-analyzer to update&quot; which is generally much quicker<p>Rust-analyzer is struggling significantly on larger repos, to the point of being barely usable.\n\n      Is this with the likes of Leptos? The fancy HTML macros add a ton of compilation time (and are an antipattern IMO).\n\n        No, just ordinary distributed systems stuff. tokio, serde, bincode, error&#x2F;logging&#x2F;testing crates, and stdlib.\n\n    &gt; Because Rust&#x27;s unit of compilation (a crate) is very large. In C&#x2F;C++ it&#x27;s a single file.<p>What do you mean exactly here?\n\n      In C++ you can compile each file independently from every other file. You can&#x27;t do that in Rust; you can only compile <i>crates</i> (which are made of many files) independently. Within a crate you can have circular references for example.<p>So the smallest chunk of work that can be parallelised is much bigger in Rust than in C++. (Unless you are writing atypically small Rust crates and atypically enormous C++ files.)\n\n        I understand that&#x27;s not a language limitation, but rather a compiler&#x2F;toolset&#x2F;ecosystem issue (like not having a standard ABI?).<p>I ask becasue I wonder what&#x27;s the real culprit here and whether it can be solved or if it&#x27;s due to the language.\n\n          It is like you say, mostly compiler&#x2F;toolset&#x2F;ecosystem, all 3.<p>While staying in the same ecosystem you can split your application into smaller crates, which many are doing. It&#x27;s just not that ergonomic.\n\n          It kind of is a language limitations. They could have said &quot;no circular dependencies at all!&quot; (which is quite reasonable) and then it would be easier to deal with.\n\n    &gt; In most cases, Rust&#x27;s very strong type system means you spend a lot less time actually running your program.<p>&gt; There are definitely exceptions though.<p>I mean.. I know what you mean but this is kinda what I meant with cope. Putting “running code” aside as an edge case seems like a dangerous moving-the-goalpost kind of Rustism that kinda grew out of the “Rust is so safe that if it compiles it’s correct”-meme. Once we’re doing serious and boring good old development, it’s a redeeming quality at best, imo. Not to mention that rust analyzer also suffers slowdowns in similar ways.<p>&gt; LLVM is still the vast majority<p>That’s interesting. So why the meager numbers from cranelift then, judging by the post? Granted, I’m not doing Rust day-to-day anymore so I’ve been ootl.<p>&gt; Because Rust&#x27;s unit of compilation (a crate) is very large. In C&#x2F;C++ it&#x27;s a single file.<p>Isn’t this the same for Go? Sure, it’s a simpler language but we’re talking many, many times on similar sized projects (wish I could link to something but unfortunately anecdotally only). Is it monomorphization, macros, or just everything combined?\n\n      &gt; So why the meager numbers from cranelift then<p>People are seeing 20-30% improvements thanks to Cranelift. Not sure why you think that’s meagre.<p>&gt; edge case<p>It’s not an edge case but it is valid to say that the pattern of development is different. You’re right that people need feedback that what they’re doing is right within 1-2 seconds. They are getting that thanks to the IDE. They need their tests to compile and run within a few seconds, and they’re getting close to that.<p>I’m not disagreeing with you. In an ideal world all builds and tests would run within 2 seconds, like you’re suggesting. And yet, people are managing to ship software successfully, despite it taking more than 2 seconds. That suggests that maybe this 2 second thing isn’t a requirement and more of a nice to have. And that maybe, there is something to people relying on IDE feedback while coding.\n\n    In C++ it can be a module nowadays, which is similar to being a crate, yet it is faster, from my clang&#x2F;vc++ experience.\n\n  &gt; Is it an unpopular opinion to say 75% of “a lot” is still “a lot”<p>I don’t know if it’s unpopular, but it may be inaccurate. OP claims that they improved by 75%, so you probably meant “25% of a lot is still a lot”.<p>&gt; I would expect incremental build speedup to be prioritized, and steadily improving. But clearly it isn’t moving very fast in that direction. So why not?<p>Is this assessment based on something?<p>For what it’s worth, people have been working on it for years, with varying approaches and levels of success. The recent spate of articles you’ve seen is precisely because these approaches are bearing fruit. Several folks have worked on making a previously single threaded frontend multithreaded, others have added an option to swap the LLVM backend out for a much faster one (cranelift), and yet others are working on moving to a faster linker by default.<p>The net gain from all of these once they land could be as much as 30–50%, depending on the project, mode of compilation (clean or incremental) and hardware (single&#x2F;multiple cores). That is a pretty fantastic improvement, considering the whole year improvements in the last 4 years have been 7%, 17%, 13% and 15%, for an overall speed gain of 37%.<p>If all of this doesn’t sound impressive, I’d encourage you to read nnethercote’s annual reports which explain how much effort went into making compile times faster. 2023’s report -  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nnethercote.github.io&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2024.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nnethercote.github.io&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;how-to-speed-up-the...</a><p>Ultimately, all of these improvements might not be enough for the people who need HMR to be productive. That’s possible. But the idea isn’t to get to a point where every line of code written in the world is Rust. There’s plenty of Rust development happening today. When the compile times drop as hoped, more people join and that grows the ecosystem.\n\n    I have a feeling many of the common multithreading optimizations carry the same flaw as incremental compilation: they give you good speed-ups in the short term, but potentially mask deeply flawed architectural decisions. Essentially improving perf by digging yourself into a deeper grave.\n\n    &gt; you probably meant “25% of a lot is still a lot”<p>Yeah exactly. This was afaik a fairy small sized application (where the majority was probably framework code) which went from 20s to 5s for incremental compilation on a very beefy desktop rig. Those absolute numbers are important to grok the situation.<p>&gt; That is a pretty fantastic improvement, considering the whole year improvements in the last 4 years have been 7%, 17%, 13% and 15%, for an overall speed gain of 37%.<p>&gt; If all of this doesn’t sound impressive, I’d encourage you to read nnethercote’s annual reports which explain how much effort went into making compile times faster<p>It’s not at all that it’s unimpressive. It’s abundantly clear that extremely bright minds are putting a ton of effort into it, consistently and over time. I’ve worked personally with some of these people and they are insanely talented and knowledgeable… Which is precisely why I’m concerned that we’re not seeing the big boosts that comes with picking low hanging fruit, perhaps there isn’t any left. Optimization tends to yield lower results over time (although the recent advances are great to see and I wish it continues). From the outside though, it appears like either inherent constraints that limit how far you can go, or at least initial compiler design reasons that would be cost-prohibitive to change.\n\n      &gt; big boosts that comes with picking low hanging fruit, perhaps there isn’t any left. Optimization tends to yield lower results over time<p>As the link I shared says<p>&gt; For the first time ever, I’m writing one of these posts without having made any improvements to compile speed myself. I have always used a profile-driven optimization strategy, and the profiles you get when you measure rustc these days are incredibly flat. It’s hard to find improvements when the hottest functions only account for 1% or 2% of execution time. Because of this I have been working on things unrelated to compile speed.<p>&gt; That doesn’t mean there are no speed improvements left to be made, as the previous section shows. But they are much harder to find, and often require domain-specific insights that are hard to get when fishing around with a general-purpose profiler. And there is always other useful work to be done.<p>---<p>&gt; From the outside though, it appears like either inherent constraints that limit how far you can go, or at least initial compiler design reasons that would be cost-prohibitive to change.<p>Also correct. Rust prioritised faster run time over fast compilation times. For example, monomorphization is something used pervasively in most Rust code. Fast at run time, but slow to compile. The fact that the entire crate needs to be compiled if a line is changed is yet another issue.<p>Everything indicates that even if Rust improves, it will never reach that 2 second recompile for large projects. But fortunately the experience of the last few years suggests that it&#x27;s still possible to succeed despite (or maybe because of) prioritising runtime over compile time.\n\nI’m not sure I understand why editing an html template requires to recompile the rust project. I implemented a static site generator in rust for my own projects, html templates are simple liquid template files, it’s instant to recompile them. Same for stylesheets. Is the author generating the html from rust directly?

      "conversation_text": "Many apps lack a good means of triggering &quot;reminders&quot; on iOS and MacOs. Apple seems to keep the secret sauce to themselves. 3rd party apps just miss the mark IMO. However, the reminders app itself leave a lot to be desired. So something like this that ties a great app into what the native apps reminders is a great idea. Thank you for sharing!\n\n  Shortcuts app has <i>just enough</i> support to manage reminders, but automation triggers are fairly limited.\n\n    I haven&#x27;t had great luck with shortcut reminders. I always feel like there are cases it didn&#x27;t trigger, then I don&#x27;t trust it.\n\n  I run my own CardSAV&#x2F;CalDAV server but as long as you have a DAV server (Fastmail gives one for eg), Reminders will happily sync against it.<p>I use it to sync my reminders&#x2F;contacts&#x2F;calendars across Thunderbird&#x2F;Linux and iOS.<p>I can edit&#x2F;update&#x2F;delete items programmatically with ease without any Apple secret sauce.\n\n    That sound like a fun project to try out. I may try that out. Thanks.\n\n    This is probably one of the best yet most underrated features of the various stock Apple organizational apps: they work just as well as vendor agnostic clients for standard protocols (IMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV, etc) with relatively little favoring of first-party services.<p>I wish this were more common, but instead it’s more typical to see things like the vendor agnostic Windows Mail being abandoned for “new” Outlook which is much pushier about using MS services.\n\n  What features is the Reminders app missing? I switched from Things to Reminders and didn&#x27;t notice any missing features. Not doubting your statement - I&#x27;m genuinely curious to know what functionality might be lacking in Reminders that I&#x27;m unaware of.\n\n    Persistent reminders. TickTick&#x27;s implementation is good.\n\n      what is a persistent reminder?\n\n        It keeps spamming notifications until you act on it. Very helpful if you need some help with attention.\n\n          I use the IOS &quot;Due&quot; app for this. I have it set-up to pull out items from Reminders that have days and times assigned.<p>Makes it really hard to forget those tasks.\n\n            I have used that, it&#x27;s pretty nice! For now I settled on TickTick cause it&#x27;s easy to use from my Linux laptop and my iOS devices. If you are fully Apple, Due is a good choice.\n\n              Also, Due syncs via iCloud, which can be e2e encrypted nowadays.<p>With TickTick you&#x27;re storing &#x2F; sharing your data with a commercial company...\n\n          I certainly see the notifications for incomplete tasks from Reminders on my lock screen every time I lift my iPhone. I have one I&#x27;ve been ignoring for weeks. Seems pretty persistent to me...\n\n  &gt; <i>Many apps lack a good means of triggering &quot;reminders&quot; on iOS and MacOs. Apple seems to keep the secret sauce to themselves.</i><p>Apple built developers an entire framework dedicated to this, which works on both iOS and macOS. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;eventkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;eventkit</a>\n\nWas it difficult to build? I&#x27;d like syncing with other task&#x2F;reminder providers from Obsidian\n\n  Difficulty is of course subjective; I have 10+ years of functional programming experience but was completely new to Swift; the core functionality took less than a week of 4ish hours a day. Apple&#x27;s EventKit API is very developer friendly and Markdown is a well known format so that made things easier. I&#x27;m not a frontend &#x2F; UI tradie so spent another few days learning SwiftUI &amp; making things look quality (and TBH I think that quality is not where I want it to be). So to answer your question... not really?\n\nI love Obsidian - its approach, the ecosystem, and the implementation.<p>But... I can&#x27;t help but feel it will become the latest application to either pivot to something unpalatable (probably after being acquired) or become abandonware, leaving me to move to Yet Another Tool. And so it prevents me from really investing in any of it - I just use a no-frills text editor.\n\n  For me, the nice part about Obsidian is that they&#x27;re just markdown files. So even if something happens to Obsidian, the notes still exist and are still easily transferrable to something else.\n\n    Yeah, having a non-proprietary data format is a huge plus. I wish the Obsidian code itself was open source.\n\n      It’s hard to make a living with open source (saying from experience).\n\n        Sadly, that&#x27;s true, and my frustration with the constant churn of software is no reflection on the good people making Obsidian.\n\n        Obsidian is free to use, and they make their money from offering additional sync-service and good will of the users. I don&#x27;t think open source would impact it much. Though, it would bear the risk of a hostile fork, maybe to include a free to sync or something. I mean the obsidian-devs have some bad history on that front.<p>But at least they should give some guarantee to Open Source it if there were no significant update in a while, similar to how Qt and KDE have their agreement. Or at least they should make the source available, so people can contribute or move away easier in case of problems.\n\n    Markdown isn’t immune to deprecation in the Obsidian ecosystem - I have files with random junk in the headers leftover from failed attempts to integrate some data management plugin or regime.\n\n      So? Does it matter much for some reason? That doesn’t seem like a compatibility issue.\n\n        If you&#x27;ve invested time into adding metadata and app-specific markdown to your setup, you lose that when you move to another tool. Has happened to me before. It&#x27;s about vendor lock-in when you go too deep into their ecosystem.\n\n          And instead of open text files with plaintext properties in the YAML frontmatter standard, you want to do.... what, exactly?<p>And the plugins are all OSS, on GitHub.<p>What do you imagine is more open with less lock-in?\n\n      Its called front matter and its supported in markdown\n\n        How does that change the point being made? Front matter is supported essentially as a bucket of metadata. Front matter has varying degrees of usefulness without supporting tooling.\n\n          Front matter is still a simple text based format that can easily be parsed by other programs, and there is already quite a bit of tooling to process it. Even without tooling, it’s human readable. The degree of usefulness just increases the more sophisticated the tool is that you’re using to read it. \nCompare this with the painful migration away from Evernote, which left me with a folder full of giant .enex files that I can technically use elsewhere, but at this point are realistically just an archive I’ll never touch unless I really need something.\n\n    Fairly easily transferrable to something else. I assume that many of the plugins that power users use involve added non-standard stuff to the files. Like if you&#x27;re adding a bunch of metadata to be consumed by the Dataview plugin, all that metadata might be worthless on a new app unless someone creates an equivalent plugin elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s open source, so they <i>can</i>. But people who want forward-compatibility should probably think about what their raw markdown files look like, and how useful they&#x27;d be in another program.\n\n      It’s not open source, just free as in beer.<p>Personally I do avoid add-ons that create special syntax in the md files so that if Obsidian ever goes shitty I’ll have an easier time migrating to whatever alternative.\n\n        Sorry, the plugins are generally open source, that&#x27;s what I was referring to.\n\n          Gotcha, yeah.<p>If it ever comes to needing an Obsidian replacement I&#x27;d hope it can aim for compatibility with the plug-in ecosystem, at least initially. No idea how difficult a target that would be. Either way, I certainly worry about my data in Obsidian less than I worry about Evernote, OneNote, or Apple Notes, even with a couple of non-standard markdown additions.<p>Since it&#x27;s not VC backed I&#x27;m hopeful about Obsidian building a long-term sustainable business without having to turn shitty, but who knows. I should sign up for Sync and give them some money.\n\n      &gt; <i>I assume that many of the plugins that power users use involve added non-standard stuff to the files. Like if you&#x27;re adding a bunch of metadata to be consumed by the Dataview plugin, all that metadata might be worthless on a new app ...</i><p>The metadata is YAML frontmatter.  Works with any frontmatter aware tools, which includes, for example, most static site generators.<p>It&#x27;s all just markdown, the plugins layer on top of Markdown.<p>Your site basically works if you shove it in GitHub pages.   With a touch of config matching, you can open an Obsidian &quot;vault&quot; in the VSCode plugin called Foam (like Roam but for a local folder structure of Markdown files).<p>Most add ons, like, say, Excalidraw for charting, are themselves tools with plugins in GitHub Pages, Hugo, MkDocs, etc., so are portable for static site gen (SSG).<p>The only thing it seems to be &quot;missing&quot; is the CRDT style multiplayer live editing of tools like Notion or Craft.\n\n    That&#x27;s the theory, but it&#x27;s not like they use strict markdown. Markdown in the first place is a very simple and limited format, so everyone has their own syntax-extensions and tweaks, and obsidian is no exception. So even if you lose the data themselves, you could lose a significant amount of ability to work with them, if somehow obsidian becomes unusable.<p>And if you build on plugins, this sometimes happens even now here and there. Plugins becoming unusable because of an update is still not uncommon. Their developing stopping for whatever reason is also a bit of a problem.\n\n  FWIW, their CEO seems quite set on long-term growth instead of a quick sell, as evidenced by <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39336308\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39336308</a>\n\n    That may be the CEOs intent, but if they have share holders and someone shows up with money it isn’t entirely the CEOs call.   They have a responsibility to produce returns and if an offer is better than what they can do without selling their obligation is pretty clear.<p>I’ve known some folks who I believe really wanted to grow a company but when faced with an offer to buy it they didn’t feel they could survive a legal challenge arguing that they should sell.\n\n      It’s 2024. By this point we all know how this ride goes. So if a founder states that they’re targeting sustainable long-term growth, and that intent isn’t reflected in how they’ve taken on investments, they’re flat-out lying.   There’s simply no excuse to be that utterly naive. The Obsidian mob seem very switched on, and their public headcount isn’t remotely indicative of VC-funded hyper-growth. It looks like they’re doing everything right.\n\n        My point being that even if the CEO intends long term growth, it may not matter.<p>People’s perception regarding the CEO is telling the truth or not is largely irrelevant at that point.<p>If the offer is big enough their hands are often tied due to their obligation to the rest of the owners.\n\n      They are bootstrapped and committed not to take VC money[1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stephango.com&#x2F;vcware\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stephango.com&#x2F;vcware</a>\n\n      Obsidian does not have any shareholders. It&#x27;s a team of 6 people, and the sole owners are the two original founders.\n\n    The Evernote CEO used to talk about how he was building a 100 year company.\n\n      As a matter of fact, Evernote still works and is improving fast.\n\n        For me Evernote peaked around 2014-2015. The native clients were fast and small and integrated well with the host platform. I haven&#x27;t used it since around 2020, so I&#x27;m glad to hear they are actually working on it.<p>I subscribed on the Plus plan for 8 years at $35 &#x2F; year. Now the personal plan is $130 &#x2F; year. I used it maybe once a week so for me that would be $2 every time I launch it. It just isn&#x27;t worth it.\n\n        Recent evolution? Do tell\n\n          Well, I suggest you check the Evernote product lead&#x27;s X account.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;fedesimio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;fedesimio</a><p>You&#x27;ll see that they are working on many improvements, some of them are already in the app.\n\n  To me, Obsidian just isn&#x27;t sticky, so I already have pivoted to Amplenote. It&#x27;s been the tool that I consistently use for note taking and personal task tracking.\n\n  I used Evernote for well over a decade and I don’t regret that I did, despite the changes that eventually forced me to get rid of it and change my habits.<p>There is already a growing ecosystem of tools that are Obsidian-like, and if Obsidian ever went down an unpalatable path, those tools are ready and waiting.<p>If a no frills editor works for you, great. But at the same time, I don’t think a future problem with Obsidian is a good reason to avoid it. In a worst case, that no frills editor will open your vault just fine. But I’d personally switch to something like Logseq, which is also coming along really nicely.<p>In the meantime, the value that Obsidian brings to my daily life is immense. And that’s worth the risk of eventually needing to find something new, especially when I know that the underlying data is completely portable.\n\n    &gt; There is already a growing ecosystem of tools that are Obsidian-like, and if Obsidian ever went down an unpalatable path, those tools are ready and waiting.<p>can you name a few? i have currently installed and enabled 65 plugins. Granted, that is mostly because the obsidian team does not know how to build a good product, leading me to use plugins. but even then, the functionality is not that bad (templater, book search, dataview, loom, custom file explorer&#x2F;command palette etc)\n\n      The fact that the product is so extensible is a sign to me that they know how to build an excellent product.<p>I&#x27;m currently using 1 community plugin and have only enabled a handful of the core plugins.<p>I personally wish they would stop adding features to Obsidian. It feels complete to me.\n\n        i disagree. extensible is super duper but even that isn&#x27;t great with Obsidian from a dev perspective. so the product &quot;Obsidan Plugin API for devs&quot; is also lacking.<p>and core features should be in core (dataview for example). what is most shocking though is that sync and publish are horrendous implementation of said features. i would kind of get it for other stuff but together they are 20 bucks plus tax per month. just now sync has &#x27;merged&#x27; a note on my iphone (no changes on iphone though) and completely scrambled the note. same with another 3 notes. if i did not check the note by chance now, i would have missed it.<p>the entire UI around a sync feature is bad.\n\n      Logseq is at the top of the list and would be the most similar&#x2F;robust in terms of linking, visualizations and plugins [0]. It’s also open source, and I think a lot of development would shift in this direction if Obsidian ever angered the community.<p>Roam Research is also conceptually similar but I’ve spent less time digging into the tooling.<p>I’ve also been keeping an eye on Zettlr and Joplin, but these are not as flexible and their usefulness would depend on how you’re using Obsidian.<p>I misplaced the link to the repo right, but there was a “universal markdown notes migrator” project I found on GH back when I was evaluating Obsidian that looked promising and the goal was to facilitate movement between tools.<p>- [0]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;logseq&#x2F;awesome-logseq\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;logseq&#x2F;awesome-logseq</a>\n\n      Check out: VSCodium + FOAM (VSCode plugin). Cross-linked markdown notes. You can then use MkDocs&#x2F;MkDocs-Material and ROAMLinks (MkDocs plugin) to publish as a cross-linked HTML site.\n\n    &gt; There is already a growing ecosystem of tools that are Obsidian-like<p>That very much depends on the definition of &quot;like&quot;. Most are very different in their concepts and abilities or even foundation. They are mostly similar, if you compare it to cloud-tools, or old commercial tools.\n\n      I think this is fair, and maybe “Obsidian-compatible” would be a better way to describe it.<p>With that said, there are a few key tools that are extremely similar conceptually, e.g. Logseq&#x2F;Roam. Logseq in particular feels like “Opinionated Obsidian”. And this is where most of the tooling growth has been occurring through plugins.\n\n  I started getting the same feeling and so switched to Logseq and have been very happy.\n\n  &gt;...leaving me to move to Yet Another Tool.<p>That&#x27;s actually integral to the notetaking&#x2F;productivity app market. Either the app soon dies out or you get bored with it and you move on to the next one.<p>Just like with self-help products. Targets of the self-help market are never intended to just read one or two books and get on with their lives. They&#x27;re vulnerable to seemingly unending consumption of one self-help product after another. They&#x27;re endlessly sold on regurgitated feel-good crap that keeps them coming back for more.<p>These productivity tools, like self-help books, become the ends in themselves, rather than the means.<p>I used to do the same thing with productivity &amp; learning apps and systems. Kept procrastinating looking for that One Good Tool. I had this misconception that if I didn&#x27;t have that one perfect notetaking tool or productivity app, then I&#x27;d be held back.<p>I ultimately realized that what was really holding me back was myself.<p>I eliminated my dependency on The One Perfect Tool, I replaced that dependency with more practical action, lightly supported by simple pen &amp; paper and plain text files, and now I&#x27;m more productive and more learned than ever.\n\nInteresting. I’ve found ReminderCal’s approach to synching with the Calendar pretty novel and foolproof (basically use an action in Shortcuts to sync it it across when you close Reminders), and I’d be interested to know how your works.<p>That said, I’ve had many, many false starts with Obsidian, and I don’t think this is enough to tilt my workflows towards it again. The Apple Notes importer does not work with images or drawings, which  kind of makes the thought of transitioning kind of moot.<p>Also, I can’t be trusted to not fiddle around as soon as I open my vault. Notes is much less customisable, but this is a wind for consistency and ‘stability’ when I open it up to <i>actually take notes</i>.\n\nHow does this sync the other way? If you delete or complete a reminder or change the description do you get duplicates or do your changes get clobbered? What about conflicts? Does it matter if you make the changes in obsidian or reminders?<p>I guess I&#x27;m asking how fragile this is in practice.\n\n  - Deleting a Task in Obsidian that has been synced to Reminders deletes the Reminder<p>- Deleting a Reminder that has been synced to Obisidian deletes the Task from Obsidian (if enabled in the settings menu)<p>- Completing a synced task in Obsidian will complete the Reminder (on the next sync)<p>- Completing a synced Reminder will complete the Task in Obsidian (immediately if the app is running)<p>- Creating a Reminder in the synced list creates a task in a note called &quot;Reminder Sync Inbox.md&quot;<p>- Editing a Task in Obsidian and syncing deletes the previously associated Reminder and creates a new one (effectively updating the text in Reminders.app)<p>The only known limitation (so far) is:<p>- Editing a synced Reminder description in Reminders.app does not update the text of the Task in Obsidian: This is hard to solve as the original Task may contain embedded links (which are stripped to just the link text for the Reminder description). Syncing those edits back to Markdown is a difficult problem that I haven&#x27;t bothered focused on yet as I feel it may not be solvable.<p>In case of a conflict, the state in Obsidian always wins :)\n\nWould love to see you add support for Logseq!\n\nWorks great. Now just make it sync with JIRA too.\n\nWhy does no one use Logseq? I prefer it to Obsidian after using both\n\n  I wanted to like Logseq, but I couldn&#x27;t stand how opinionated it is about the format of my notes. Also, at least on Ubuntu 22, there was a noticeable delay when interacting with any UI element.\n\n    Interesting -- I like the bullets and the &#x27;restrictiveness&#x27;\n\n      You can achieve a similar effect in Obsidian by using the plugins Outliner and Zoom.<p>I still feel Logseq is still a better outliner (although I don&#x27;t use it), Obsidian is better at handling the other use cases.\n\n  I use LogSeq with the TODO plugin giving me a sidebar view of outstanding TODOs. It would be wonderful to have a similar plugin for LogSeq but of course the onus is on me to make that happen. If someone were working on such an integration I would gladly support it via Patreon or open collective, etc…\n\n  It&#x27;s confusing. I tried it a few time, but never really got into it. It seems very opinionated into what it offers and seems to force you into a workflow. Obsidian is more liberate and flexible in that regard.\n\nI would love to have exactly this but for Omnifocus! I currently do it with Shortcuts but is limited to one way sync which is very inconvenient. Having the task in context on Obsiadian but also nicely organized and actionable in a task manager is great.\n\nAs in the other comments here, I use Obsidian but avoid making it tightly coupled with my workflows. I like the fact that I can walk away when needed.<p>I used reminders a lot earlier, but I have stopped using them these days. I continue to use Calendars and Notes. Between the two, the need for reminders has gone from my workflow. If I need reminding and have a date&#x2F;time, it is calendared. If I need a Checklist (Shopping), it is in a Note or part of a Note (e.g., Shared Shopping List with your partner).\n\nI love Obsidian, but mostly use a filter (dataview) to deal with my tasks and overview. Most of the time on Windows and Linux. I do not use my macBook a lot. Only for testing the application we work on, so not very familiar with Reminders, though I like the idea. How do you properly link them up as they might go out of sync (loose relation) if one of the texts gets changed.\n\nI use Obsidian daily, but my understanding of the app is terrible. I use it because it&#x27;s the best markdown editor I&#x27;ve found — I just edit separate .md files, many of which are essentially a &#x27;template&#x27; that contains a whole bunch of checkboxes.<p>Is there a good &#x27;starter guide&#x27; that I can use to get up to speed so I can start using Obsidian to track my notes, etc.? I&#x27;m very used to editing individual .md files for this kind of thing, but manually, and I get the impression Obsidian offers a bunch of benefits.\n\n  There’s a lot of crappy “I want to be a content creator!”-tier content out there. You’ve gotta do a bit of digging to find examples that aren’t someone organising their YouTube channel, crappy Medium blog, or other content creation side hustle.\n\n  For anyone looking for a simple markdown editor (nothing more), I would recommend Typora. It&#x27;s closed source, and the plugin system is lacking, but it gets the essentials basically perfect.\n\n    I&#x27;m on macOS, and I use either TextEdit or Vim. The problem isn&#x27;t Obsidian itself, but the ecosystem in which it exists.\n\n    I used to use Typora but something put me off — I can&#x27;t totally remember what. It <i>might</i> have been that it creates copies of files rather than saving in-place, which then screws up hard links. But it might have been something less &#x27;niche&#x27; too!\n\n  Honestly, play around until you find your own flow.<p>You don&#x27;t need to use every Obsidian feature under the sun to become a productivity machine, nor have it all perfectly organised, linked and categorised in your &quot;second brain&quot;. Take notes, label them well, and use the global search when you need something. Try a new plugin from time to time.<p>Using Obsidian &quot;just&quot; as a markdown editor is a <i>perfectly valid use</i>. I used VSCode with some Markdown plugins for years. I tried Typora, Coda, etc but they felt too limited and sluggish. I just wanted code-like markdown editing with a bit of fanciness, and Obsidian does just that.<p>I have a template for journalling, and a simplistic structure for where to place files in my knowledgebase. It&#x27;s not perfect, and doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it works for me.<p>If you do want an example of <i>some</i> of my structure (I share some of the resource&#x2F;knowledge publicly), see here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publish.obsidian.md&#x2F;thecapegreek\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publish.obsidian.md&#x2F;thecapegreek</a><p>The only drawback I can say really is that I need to better separate public and private resources, as I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll accidentally publish some private notes that live among the other files you might see in the link.\n\n  I have published a free guide: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dsebastien.net&#x2F;the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-obsidian&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dsebastien.net&#x2F;the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-o...</a><p>I also have a course: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developassion.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;obsidian-starter-course\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developassion.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;obsidian-starter-course</a><p>And a starting point with a preconfigured vault and a user guide: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developassion.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;obsidian-starter-kit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developassion.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;obsidian-starter-kit</a>\n\nThank you, an excellent tool and works well so far. It was a nice easy setup, you already convinced me to purchase the lifetime pro to say thanks. Gotta support indie developers in an ecosystem I use.<p>A minor bug I noticed, you don&#x27;t have media controls on the demo video on your website. I had to right-click and select play, clicking the video didn&#x27;t start it either.\n\n  Thank you, it really means a lot! The video should autoplay so I hid the controls; I&#x27;ll add them back though as I guess autoplay is flakey.\n\nIs there an Apple Tasks app (or compatible app) for Android?\n\nThis is really the missing puzzle piece for my Obsidian setup, and therefore was an insta-buy.<p>However important recomemndation though: I selected &quot;enable syncing&quot; in the onboard process and your app proceeded to sync <i>every</i> <i>single</i> task from my entire vault. I am watching the number climb into the hundreds. There should be some kind of warning that this will happen, and&#x2F;or some way to filter which tasks sync (ie: tags, or tasks in a specific note).\n\n  Thank you, this is the second request I had for filtering so I will add it.\n\n  Hi, version 1.1.0 just shipped that added an option to specify a Global Filter similar to the Task Plugin global filter, so if configured only Tasks containing the filter text will be included; once configured you might wish to click Clear Cache to remove all the existing reminders and re-scan your Vault. Hope it solves your issue!\n\nUsed obsidian for a while but had too many pains with it. Eventually migrated to SuperNotes and couldn’t be happier.\n\n  &gt; <i>&quot;Currently data is not end-to-end-encrypted (E2EE) on the platform, but this is something we hope to offer in the future.</i>&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;faq&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a><p>Shame...\n\nThank you! This was something I was desperately looking for when I started using Obsidian. Already paid for the lifetime license :)<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me what happens if I run this on multiple machines. I have a few different machines that I use throughout the day but none are on &quot;24&#x2F;7&quot; so I&#x27;d love to install this everywhere so it&#x27;s always syncing. I&#x27;d love for that to be possible but I think either way it might be useful to document whether I can&#x2F;shouldn&#x27;t do that :)\n\n  That case is definitely undefined behaviour right now; if I had to guess it would result in duplicates at the moment. I’ll work on supporting it but for now I don’t recommend it!\n\n    Makes sense, consensus is tricky and a weird use case I know. Thanks!\n\nVery cool. Reminders is one of those Apple Apps that has proper API.\nSo anyone can integrate with it.<p>I&#x27;ve build two apps on top of it:\n1. macOS habits tracker <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;alto-computer&#x2F;id6478018751?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;alto-computer&#x2F;id6478018751?mt=...</a>\n2. small web app to publish my daily habits online <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.me&#x2F;anton&#x2F;daily\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.me&#x2F;anton&#x2F;daily</a>\n\nExcellent, I was just thinking about something like this a couple of weeks ago.<p>&gt; &quot;Turquoise Hexagon Cybernetics&quot;<p>Nice homage to Boards of Canada!\n\n  BoC Maxima!\n\nIs this also available via dmg offline install?\n\n  Unfortunately it&#x27;s App Store only right now.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing issues with off-by-one dates? If I set a date of 2024-03-20 on an Obsidian task (today), I&#x27;m getting a Reminder out the other side with a due date of 2024-03-19 (yesterday).<p>Side note: it looks like the support email (remindersyncturquoisehexagon.co.uk) is malformed? Gmail is refusing to send emails to it.\n\n  Hi, the email should be remindersync@turquoisehexagon.co.uk please let me know the issue you’re facing!\n\nI wish there was a way to syn from Apple Notes to Obsidian (or maybe there is?) Apple Notes is just faster and more convenient for daily notes, but I want Obsidian to be my repository, so I want some mechanism of automatically syncing certain notes or importing at some intervals.\n\n  Either, export your Apple Notes as Markdown:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;exporter&#x2F;id1099120373?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;exporter&#x2F;id1099120373?mt=12</a><p>Or use the official Importer:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.obsidian.md&#x2F;import&#x2F;apple-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.obsidian.md&#x2F;import&#x2F;apple-notes</a><p>Btw, Shortcuts can slam things into your Obsidian vault because it&#x27;s just text files.  That can be as fast or faster than Notes.  You might need a shortcuts helper like Toolbox Pro that can remember a path to your vault and write to it from your shortcuts:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts&#x2F;id1476205977\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts&#x2F;id14...</a>\n\nFeedback:\n- It works! and really easily too! Thank you\n- Things I wish it could do: Sync based on #tag #metadata. I use &#x27;Checklist&#x27; obsidian plugin and there&#x27;s check-boxes that I throw in and there&#x27;s &#x27;checklist&#x27; items with tag name (e.g., #TODO) that I use to actually collate things that are to-be-done.\n\n  Hi, glad you like it!<p>Version 1.1.0 just shipped that allows you to specify a Global Filter; only Tasks containing the filter will be synced if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after? Or would you like to exclude notes from being included based on properties at the beginning of the document?\n\n    Hi Rahil, yep, just as you said! Thank you! I&#x27;m waiting for the update to sync into the App Store to test this.\n\nIs it possible to introduce a trial? I&#x27;d want to make sure that the features work as described and am curious how smooth this works when not using your Macbook often. Like whether it will sync them in the background when the laptop is closed. Should I simply buy and go for a refund via Apple if it doesn&#x27;t work out? Though I feel like this might be worse for you.<p>Tried it out just now as a free user and it synced thousands of completed reminders as `- [x] ...` for each. It&#x27;s hard to make the jump to pay for this when I cannot test it out fully.\n\n  Hi, thanks for the feedback. I believe the free version should be representative as a trial and also useful without upgrading. If you would like to try premium please email and I can add you to the test flight.<p>I designed the App to be running all the time on my MacBook as that is where I use Obsidian; during my usage I have observed syncing working with my machine plugged in and display closed. This should be possible to test yourself with the free 6 hour sync interval.<p>For the issue you mentioned, by any chance did you select an existing list or create a new empty list? If selecting an existing reminder list completed Reminders will be synced to the inbox. It was an untested flow, but I think it’s correct as the program ensures the list state is synced to the vault state. I believe the setup wizard recommends creating a new list, I will add a note that completed reminders will be added to your vault if you select an existing list.\n\nI wrote my own version of this - but ended up abandoning it for todoist. What I care about is that Obsidian is my “point of service” for all of my daily notes - but the actual management of todos seems better outside of the tool, rather then inside. As long as I can quickly and easily create tasks in notes, and display them in the correct output, using todoist to mange the backend seems reasonable to me.\n\n  Is there a way to sync obsidian notes to todoist? I&#x27;ve been using this app on TestFlight and forcing myself to use Apple reminders.  I like that I can add reminders via Siri if I&#x27;m away from a computer, and sync tasks throughout my day from meetings or other things... but I don&#x27;t like reminders kanban, and some of the data embed options in it.  Feels too bare bones\n\nHi @rahilb, this sounds very intriguing; but I have a question regarding the In-App Purchases: what do these do?  Is the app a trial that eventually requires a subscription or lifetime purchase?<p>I think what Obsidian with recent changes to their sorage sync fees is actually brilliant.  I paid $8&#x2F;month for 50GB, then they dropped the storage to 10GB.  So I’m getting a great deal for the same $8 compared to new users &amp; now they have a very low-grade $4&#x2F;moonth plan that probably works for a lot of people … maybe even me.  But going from 50GB to 1GB for half teh cost has me locked in to an extent.<p>That said $9&#x2F;year doesn’t seem crazy for this one feature but I’m reluctant to install this without knowing this in advance.  Still surprised Apple doesn’t require these details upfront … but these details aren’t in the app store or site as far as I can tell.\n\n  Hi, the free version should be sufficient for most users; once installed and configured it provides:<p>- syncing of vault tasks to reminders (once every six hours)<p>- completion of vault tasks in reminders (immediately when the app is running)<p>- creation of tasks from reminders (also immediate while running)<p>- manual syncing whenever you want (click a button to sync vault tasks to reminders if you don’t want to wait for the automatic sync)<p>If you purchase, you get access to the following nice to have features:<p>- faster sync intervals (I.e. your vault is checked automatically for new tasks up to every minute)<p>- deletion sync: if you delete a Reminder the associated Task is deleted from the vault (immediately)<p>- descriptions for Reminders: the reminder description includes the note name from Obsidian; soon this will also include any child elements of the task.<p>- ability to only sync tasks with a due date<p>Like I said the free version should still be useful for most people. Once installed there is also a description of premium features on the purchase screen.<p>I’ll add these to the App Store description; thanks for the feedback!"

It&#x27;s interesting to me that the data from the observers provided this information:<p>&quot;Everyone above 96th Street saw the moon completely covering the disk of the sun, though no one below 96th street was able to do so. That experience represented a victory in measurement: The eclipse’s southern border could be pinpointed to within 225 feet, or the distance between 230 Riverside Drive and 240 Riverside Drive. The shadow’s border was literally caught between two buildings, each on its own city block.&quot;\n\n    Aren&#x27;t the movement of the earth and sun so predictable that we could have simulated this outcome to a similar degree of accuracy?\n\n      Experiments like this are how you confirm whether or not your predictions are accurate.\n\nGrrr.

The slack tool uses the name already used by OpenNebula. &#x2F;s\n\n    Not to mention they jinxed Slack(ware) for many.\n\n  And the Nebula streaming platform. Which is unfortunate because I&#x27;m using both.<p>I get it, nebulae are cool.\n\n    Not forgetting the awesome  Nebula game engine\n\nI&#x27;m sure that this just because I&#x27;m not the target audience, so intend only the very gentlest criticism. But I literally LOLed at how completely incomprehensible this README was for me. It has really been a while since I&#x27;ve read a paragraph and had literally no idea what it was talking about. But here&#x27;s the winner:<p>&gt; A network agnostic DHT crawler and monitor. The crawler connects to DHT bootstrappers and then recursively follows all entries in their k-buckets until all peers have been visited.<p>Following the Wikipedia link for &quot;DHT&quot; yielded some clues. (Ah. Distributed hash table.) But I&#x27;ve still been looking at this for several minutes now and am basically just puzzled. But the graphs are pretty! Reading the word &quot;amino&quot; a little further down threw me off the scent for a bit. But I gather that is actually a proper noun, and we aren&#x27;t really talking about proteins here.<p>Maybe an initial sentence that makes fewer assumptions about the reader&#x27;s familiarity with the jargon would be helpful.\n\n  This is not a particularly egregious example, but it&#x27;s kind of spectacular how everything crypto adjacent revels in technobabble.<p>The detractors of the ecosystem (myself included, to be honest) will be quick to point out that obfuscating the tech as magic as much as possible, as well as creating an inside group lingo, is key to onboarding and retaining people into it. But it&#x27;s fascinating how that percolates throughout the dev community behind it as well.\n\n    I feel the same way about AI&#x2F;LLM lingo\n\n  While I agree, there is a whole generation of people who know what a DHT is, it&#x27;s not really that obscure.<p>I&#x27;m talking about of course very late 90s, 00&#x27;s P2P file sharing, Kademlia, torrents but also later &quot;eventually consistent&quot; databases ( remember those? )<p>The crypto 20 somethings hype beasts came way later.\n\n  A DHT is a decentralized key-value database, it&#x27;s most famous use being in the bittorrent protocols, it uses a routing algorithm to guarantee that you can find the peers that can retrieve the value of a known key, granted that you at least know one peer in the network (even if that peer doesn&#x27;t know the value). Essentially the network is split into buckets and it guarantees that you&#x27;ll either will be already connected to a peer that knows the value for the key, or that that peer knows a peer whose bucket is closer to the key, you can then recursively ask for peers that are closer and closer until you find one that knows the key, as you do this search you keep track of the peers so the next time you ask for another key you&#x27;re more likely to know a peer that is closer to it. A typical DHT implementation has you keep track of hundreds of peers to guarantee the robustness of the network.<p>One issue is that peers go offline and online all the time, so the network is ever changing, if you turn off your client for a week and then come back, your only hope is that at least one of the peers you know is still online, if that&#x27;s the case then that&#x27;s fine, if that&#x27;s not the case, or you&#x27;re starting the client for the first time, then there&#x27;s no way for you to connect to the network and query for keys. In bittorrent this is not an issue as most torrents include trackers, the original centralized way of finding peers on the network, but it seems that each project listed on this page has it&#x27;s own separate DHT network that doesn&#x27;t connect to the main network (the one used by bittorrent), so for you to connect to these networks for the first time you need to use a bootstrap peer, this is just a normal peer on the network that is known to be always online, usually hosted by owner of the project, and it&#x27;ll give you a starting point to find other peers in the network.<p>What this project does in essence, is connect to a bootstrap peer, then use the properties of the routing algorithm to efficiently find out all the peers that are currently online.\n\n  The Kademlia DHT paper is a pretty straightforward description of a DHT - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdos.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;~petar&#x2F;papers&#x2F;maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdos.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;~petar&#x2F;papers&#x2F;maymounkov-kademlia...</a>\n\n    BitTorrent&#x27;s BEP regarding DHT also explains how it works quite clearly. The implementation is based on Kademlia and can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bittorrent.org&#x2F;beps&#x2F;bep_0005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bittorrent.org&#x2F;beps&#x2F;bep_0005.html</a>\n\n  When the choice is to either quickly explain why a potential user should use your project or teaching someone without domain knowledge what the project is I would choose the former every time.<p>The part you quote even provides links to DHT and k-buckets if you want more information. That first paragraph is important real-estate and shouldn&#x27;t be wasted on someone who most likely has no use of the project.<p>Every domain has these words that sound alien to newcomers and you can&#x27;t explain them to everyone all the time.\n\nWhy is BitTorrent not supported? Perhaps I&#x27;m misunderstanding this thing but it seems like application #1.\n\n  Because this seems to cater to the cryptocurrency&#x2F;blockchain culture.\n\n  My guesses:<p>a) Many other tools exist for that.<p>b) Bittorrent DHT modes are simple and interchangeable. They can give you a list of peer addresses associated with certain (torrent) hash — and only if you know the exact hash. Even client versions can&#x27;t generally be collected (apart from some protocol extensions). The only thing you learn about DHT member is that it exists. On the contrary, this project is for heterogeneous networks in which peers announce various services.<p>c) Number of Bittorrent DHT nodes is… bigger.<p>d) To collect interesting data from Bittorrent DHT, one needs to observe as much third party torrent hash requests as possible. To do that, multiple nodes are needed. Moreover, they need to run for a long time, not just because it takes time to make a lot of requests to a lot of nodes, but also because of external preference for long-running nodes. Not sure how important it is, but, anecdotally, a fresh DHT node sees twice as much requests after a week than after a day.\n\n  Looks like Nebula uses go-libp2p and all of the supported networks listed in the README use libp2p for their p2p networking. Mainline DHT doesn&#x27;t support the same transport protocols that libp2p supports (such ash TCP+Yamux+Noise) which is probably why Nebula doesn&#x27;t support Bittorrent\n\n  Because it isn&#x27;t really network-agnostic.<p>It only supports IPFS and derivitaves thereof.\n\n&#x2F;me remembers various DHT views, traffic flows, client stats, graphs and other data decorations in Azureus. Now that&#x27;s what I call a dashboard.\n\nIt isn&#x27;t really network-agnostic... in fact it doesn&#x27;t support the (by far) largest DHT out there, the Mainline DHT that bittorrent uses.<p>This is just a crawler for DHTs that use IPFS&#x27;s implementation, or at least smell very similar to it.\n\nCan someone explain why we want to crawl and&#x2F;or monitor? What is this used for?<p>When I think of a crawler, I think of a non-homogonous network (if that is the right term).<p>But with the blockchain, isn&#x27;t it the case that each node has an entire copy of the blockchain, so you don&#x27;t need to &quot;crawl&quot; it, it works more like a database.<p>What am I not understanding about this?\n\nInstead of everyone crawling on their own, isn&#x27;t it more efficient if everyone shared the same index somehow?"

      "conversation_text": "I have a fantasy where I win the lottery or inherit millions from a long lost relative and can live out my days developing whatever project I want. That project would be the ultimate build system.<p>There are at least two problems of course. I&#x27;m probably not that smart and I don&#x27;t buy lottery tickets.\n\n  Maybe the long lost relative has already developed an ultimate build system nobody knows of.\n\n  I am sure that some companies would spend billions (yes, with a &quot;b&quot;) for that. And they already have some of the smartest people on Earth working for them.<p>The article is more theory than practice. It practice, the big problem is not really about knowing what should be rebuilt. It is about tying the work of many people with different ideas on how thing should be done together.<p>The part about getting the build order correct, which is what the article is about is still important. But that&#x27;s typically not the reason why everyone hates build systems. People can live with the occasional inefficiency, or &quot;make clean&quot;. But getting that binary-only library that is not in the standard location with that source-only other library and its weird versioning scheme, both needing a different version of the same third library, written in a different programming language and using a different packet manager...\n\n  We&#x27;ve had `make` for north of forty years. I&#x27;m all for it being demoted to the <i>penultimate</i> build system but we mustn&#x27;t ignore our Sisyphean tendencies.<p>I personally hope Nix eats the world.\n\nThis is a fantastic paper that I come back to over the years. I remember talking about it with a coworker when it came out, and we were amazed how elegantly it made the point that Excel is a build system, and how it helps understand how all build systems fit together in their design space.\n\n  An exercise for the esoteric programmer would be to make a sheet that turns Excel into an actual build system that can drive the build of a typical C program.\n\n  I&#x27;m great at excel and terrible at programming. Can you break down what&#x27;s meant here?\n\n    In Excel, every cell has some number of inputs (which are other cells), and a rule for calculating the cell’s value from its input. That is basically how software build systems work, except usually they use files instead of spreadsheet cells, and they run commands (like “compile this source code”, or “combine these seven files into one program”) instead of Excel formulas.\n\n    In a build system, when you update a source code file, it should recompile the binaries that depend on it. Similarly, in excel when you update a cell in the spreadsheet, it should recompute the cells that refer to it.<p>The paper is about thinking about build systems in a more modular way. Are dependencies specified statically or dynamically? What algorithm is used to decide what should get rebuilt after an update? What order do we rebuild things? What happens if we pick different combinations of algorithm+order?\n\n      Is that actually a thing? What algorithms do you mean? I thought everything that depends on a change gets rebuilt.\n\n        The devil is in the details.<p>For example, Make decides to rebuild based on timestamp, while Bazel decides to recompute based of file hashes. Thus, if you touch a file but don&#x27;t change its contents, Make might rebuild things that Bazel wouldn&#x27;t. Another example in the paper is the INDIRECT function in Excel. This makes it so that Excel cannot compute the dependency graph before the build starts. Excel has ways to deal with this, but they might cause some cells to be recomputed even when they didn&#x27;t actually need to be. The paper has a bunch of interesting examples like this, it&#x27;s worth the read :)<p>The problem of dynamic dependencies is particularly tricky. For example, suppose that you want to teach your makefile that your compilation depends on the source C file, but also on all the headers that are #included by that C file. And you want to actually look inside the C file to get that list of headers, not just copy paste the list into the makefile. There&#x27;s more than one way to handle this.\n\n  This seems mostly exercise in Haskell programming, and not really related to actual things that people look for in the build system.<p>For example, paper talks a great deal about schedulers, but those are very minute implementation details. If bazel gets &quot;suspending&quot; scheduler instead of  &quot;restarting&quot; one, this is a super major change in the paper&#x27;s eyes, but no user is likely to notice (other than &quot;hey it works 2% faster now, cool!&quot;).<p>Moreover, the paper&#x27;s scheduler abstraction is too limited - there are a whole bunch of schedulers which are non-representative in it, for example imagine a scheduler which is aware of memory and CPU usage, and schedules the tasks to avoid out-of-memory condition (like recent bazel).<p>The division on &quot;cloud&quot; vs &quot;non-cloud&quot; systems is also pretty weird... ok, bazel has cloud caching built-in but make requires external &quot;ccache&quot;, but the resulting  behaviors are pretty similar.\n\nOne of my favorite papers, and it guided my build system design.\n\nThis is the first time I encountered this, and I wish I had seen it earlier. It&#x27;s a great read!\n\nHey, it&#x27;s Dr. Simon Peyton Jones of the Haskell community! Love seeing his name pop up.\n\nI&#x27;ve worked on build systems quite a bit across a disparity of languages, frameworks, operating systems and engines. I&#x27;ve constructed some really big build systems spitting out 100&#x27;s of SKUs across a dozen target platform, and I&#x27;ve built studio-wide build systems that again, spit out hundreds of SKU&#x27;s across dozens of projects, with hundreds to thousands of programmer and artist hours per day of code and art and other binary assets pouring into the version control every hour of every day.<p>And the universal constant in all build systems is always a problem of management. I&#x27;ve turned 7 hour builds into 7 minute builds, and management doesn&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ve saved literally thousands of hours of programmer time per year on projects, and management doesn&#x27;t care. Build systems are a cost center. Always neglected, never funded, and not seen as critical infrastructure.<p>Build systems, at the end of the day, no matter the language or target platform, are never really that complicated, we just tend to over-complicate them. What I really want, if I had the time to implement, is a build file system.<p>All that said, I&#x27;ll never go back to working on a big build system without having a PM that insulates me from the unreasonable demands of being woken up at 4AM by a Producer absolutely frantic because &quot;the build system isn&#x27;t working at all!&quot; but when checking on the problem, it&#x27;s because a developer checked in some code late and night and then went home. I have some serious trauma from those years of my life."

Here&#x27;s a summary description with research citations:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whn.global&#x2F;scientific&#x2F;spectrum-of-covid-19-from-asymptomatic-organ-damage-to-long-covid-syndrome&#x2F;#brain\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whn.global&#x2F;scientific&#x2F;spectrum-of-covid-19-from-asym...</a>\n\nLeaky blood brain barrier does not bode well for the future, especially with mass and repeated infections. This is associated with Alzheimer’s, dementia, and other neurodegenerstive disorders:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrneurol.2017.188\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrneurol.2017.188</a>\n\n  Wow that&#x27;s terrible.  Well.. science has major incentive to find cures now.  How many have long covid?  Or maybe even subclinical long covid that may silently boost Alzheimer&#x27;s risk?<p>On a more positive note, they recently found that there is some sort of frequency that may enhance &#x2F; trigger the natural junk clearance mechanisms that go on during sleep.\n\n    <i>&quot;..recently found that there is some sort of frequency that may enhance &#x2F; trigger the natural junk clearance mechanisms that go on during sleep.&#x27;</i><p>I believe you are referencing [0], where scientists discovered that in mouse models the naturally occurring brainwaves generated during sleep help clean up extra cellular &#x27;junk&#x27; in the brain via the glymphatic system.<p>It has been known since 2012 that the glymphatic system (which was discovered around that time) was a mechanism for cleaning the brain. And even back then there was speculation around if Alzheimer patients had some kind of damage to this system which caused the build up of amyloid proteins.<p>I have yet to see any research conducted on figuring that out (but it may exist).<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2816616\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2816616</a>\n\n  Even with this news, several in this thread are repeating that it&#x27;s nothing special compared with influenza. People have turned off their minds to listen to culture war nonsense\n\n  As far as I&#x27;m concerned the data has for a long time said that Covid typically causes lasting damage, it&#x27;s just that for most people it&#x27;s at a subclinical level.<p>If this were not the case why do we see rising odds for Long Covid with repeated infections?  If there&#x27;s no lasting damage and it&#x27;s facing a more tuned-in immune system the expected result would be a lower incidence.<p>And we see athletes with higher rates of Long Covid than the population at large.  Or do we?  That could also be explained by athletes being more aware of where their limits are and are used to pushing themselves to those limits--hence they are more aware of impairment.\n\nBetween MS and having had COVID 4+ times, first one giving me long for 6 months, it&#x27;s a miracle my brain keeps ticking. The human body is an insane piece of machinery.\n\n  Hang in there\n\nThe last para suggests that this is not reversible. But does anyone have any treatment options or supplements&#x2F;nootropics to recommend?\n\n  Long Walks, Sleep, Ritalin :-)\n\n    Long walks and Ritalin can trigger PEM so I would be careful with those, for anyone reading\n\n      What’s PEM?\n\n        PEM is post-exertional malaise, the hallmark symptom of mecfs and some portion of what we call long covid. It&#x27;s brutal, trying to push through it can lead to permanent worsening of symptom severity.\n\n    While my wife would love nothing more than long walks, her long covid still stops her from exercising - before covid she was down the gym 5 days a week and loves being outdoors.<p>There can be mitochondrial damage in some LC patients which will stop them being able to release energy the way they used to. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news-medical.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;20240104&#x2F;Study-identifies-mitochondrial-dysfunction-as-cause-of-long-COVID-fatigue.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news-medical.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;20240104&#x2F;Study-identifies-...</a>\n\n    Most experts on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) would advise most CFS sufferers to avoid stimulants because they tend to make the fatigue worse (once the stimulant effects wear off).<p>And that has been my experience.\n\n  TMS, tdcs, Ritalin, abilfy, lamotrigine, ketamihe, b6, B12, egcg\n\n  This is a bit out there but I read some books on polyvagal theory that suggested I could induce the &quot;rest &amp; digest&quot; state by leaning into and completing the &quot;fight or flight&quot; and &quot;shutdown&quot; states. There are many nervous system calming techniques that help e.g. rubbing my coat hanger area (if you draw a coat hanger between your neck and shoulders on the front &amp; back), chanting om or making sighing noises, and taking long hot showers to name a few<p>Yoga nidra (sleep meditation) has been quite helpful.<p>What really helped is also performing nervous system calming techniques not only at rest, but slowly when I walk around as well when I was able. Got the idea from Becca Kennedy who just posted this video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XfZFtWx1YvM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XfZFtWx1YvM</a><p>The downside is that a lot of people are out to take your money when you read about this. I&#x27;m skeptical of brain retaining courses. I trust Deb Dana&#x27;s books\n\n    Calming the sympathicus is one of the very few things that somewhat works for me. It helps to relax and get good sleep.<p>One technique I&#x27;ll add to the list: skin massage (literally pinching it with your fingers) around the sympathicus area: along the lower ribs, up the sternum and into a V-shape around the neck (roughly following the collarbones). The nerve endings on the skin literally stimulate the sympathetic system, allowing it to &quot;reset&quot;. I don&#x27;t know the exact mechanism, but I can vouch for it actually working.\n\n      That&#x27;s really interesting. Did you learn about this somewhere or was it more by yourself?\n\n        I learned about it from a physical therapist. This seems to be old knowledge that was somewhat widespread (in the german-speaking world at least), then discredited in modernity as medicine was looking to be more evidence-based<i>, and is now making a slow comeback.<p></i> NB: I have nothing against evidence-based medicine. But our bodies are much weirder than the high modernists were willing to admit.\n\n    I wonder if the opposite works, heavy weight lifting?<p>Pushing heavy weights is very taxing on the nervous system and kicks it into gear to start the process of growth.\n\n      I&#x27;d be careful with strenuous exercise, it may cause PEM. See comments below.\n\n  Vinpocetine is known to increase bloodflow to the brain, and it possesses neuroprotective effects.<p>&quot;Vinpocetine, a derivative of the alkaloid vincamine, has been clinically used in many countries for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and dementia for more than 30 years. Currently, vinpocetine is also available in the market as a dietary supplement to enhance cognition and memory...&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5766389&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5766389&#x2F;</a>\n\n  I&#x27;m using something called &quot;Sharpmind - Brain Formula&quot; by Solaray. I don&#x27;t have an hard-evidence that the ingredients are working against this particular issue, but I can say that it has made me feel a lot better&#x2F;more present in my mind than I ever was post-infection. I have recommended it to a few others, one of which who has actually tried it and seems to feel similar to me about its effects.\n\n  NMN\n\nRecently read an article suggesting that we should drop the term Long Covid, as it implies that there is something unique about it, when the research seems to show that the impairment post-Covid is very similar to that from Influenza:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;society&#x2F;2024&#x2F;mar&#x2F;15&#x2F;long-covid-symptoms-flu-cold\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;society&#x2F;2024&#x2F;mar&#x2F;15&#x2F;long-covid-s...</a>\n\n  Minimizing the impact of COVID has a long and ugly history for such a young virus. One paper contradicting every other source so far certainly shouldn’t be accepted as gospel.\n\n    I think the point here is that we don&#x27;t know either way, so maybe we shouldn&#x27;t attribute it all specifically to COVID. When we were told to act like hypochondriacs for a year or 2, it shifted behavior.<p>COVID was the devil virus and people were attributing many things to it.  And since there is no diagnostic test for &quot;long COVID&quot;, we are sorta just guessing everywhere here.\n\n      You may not know either way but the scientific community absolutely does. Over 350,000 papers published here referencing long covid specifically and growing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;research&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;research&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;</a>\n\n  Flu like or not, long convid is a collection of many different syndrome.<p>It need to be more specific to be useful.\n\n    Alternatively, you could view ( flu, colds, covid etc.) it to be the same syndrome with several facets and diversities.\n\n  Experts react: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scimex.org&#x2F;newsfeed&#x2F;expert-reaction-long-covid-may-be-no-different-to-other-long-term-virus-effects\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scimex.org&#x2F;newsfeed&#x2F;expert-reaction-long-covid-m...</a><p>&gt; It is because of these specific factors as well as inherent limitations of the study methodology itself, that their conclusion that it is “time to stop using terms like ‘long COVID’” is overstated and potentially unhelpful. Long COVID has been a global phenomenon, recognised by WHO.<p>&gt; Unfortunately, this question cannot be simply answered in this work. The study is observational, based on reported symptoms with no physiological or detailed functional follow-up data. Without laboratory pathophysiological assessment of individual patients, it is impossible to say that this is indistinguishable from flu-related or any other post-viral syndrome.<p>Of course, every &#x27;puchy-headline&#x27; paper deserves to be considered on its own merits, but perhaps read <i>the paper</i> not an article <i>about the paper</i> if you want to take it as &#x27;The Truth&#x27;.<p>&quot;Long covid is not a thing&quot; plays into the &quot;Covid is not a thing&quot; conspiracy theory; it&#x27;s probably a harmful trope, rather than meaningfully helpful for the people suffering symptoms.<p>There is universal agreement the symptoms are real.<p>It&#x27;s unclear what benefit using a different name for it offers.\n\n    &gt; &quot;Long covid is not a thing&quot; plays into the &quot;Covid is not a thing&quot; conspiracy theory; it&#x27;s probably a harmful trope, rather than meaningfully helpful for the people suffering symptoms.<p>That something plays into a harmful trope doesn’t speak to its veracity though, and diminishing smaller inconvenient truths so as to not lead people astray in my opinion exacerbates rather than diminishes conspiracy theories.<p>Could probably have prevented a lot of wasted time, money, and endless internet arguments by saying something early on like “ivermectin, which humans are regularly prescribed, does look promising for treating Covid, but only at dosages that are very toxic to humans, or in populations that might have parasites, as a result of curing those parasites”, instead of the “lol it’s only for horses!” stuff, or by clearly stating “lab leak is possible, and not the same thing as an intentionally man-made bioweapon unleashed by Chinese people”.\n\n      If the potential effect of a message is rather harmful, it&#x27;s reasonable to hold the veracity of that message to a higher standard of scrutiny than if a message is benign.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a good study, scientifically. Scrutiny was not applied before reporting on it, and now we have a harm on our hands. The fact that we&#x27;re discussing it attests to that, since its a sideshow leeching attention away from the main topic of long covid&#x27;s effects.<p>Agree that public messaging could have and should be a lot better on the topics you mentioned, but disagree that harm should not be at least a part of the calculus.\n\n        Who decides on what is harmful vs what is benign?\n\n          This question can be be applied to almost anything and only serves to pointlessly redirect discussion (&quot;sealioning&quot;) - &quot;don&#x27;t write code with bugs&quot; &quot;oh? Who decides what is a bug and what is intended behaviour?&quot; - &quot;don&#x27;t take candy from babies&quot; &quot;who decides at which age you turn from a baby into a toddler?&quot;\n\n      Your last paragraph makes no sense to me.<p>There were plenty of places which published long, complex, nuanced data and explanations about ivermectin.<p>But lots of people are unable to understand complex writing or statistics. And most people have little understanding of biology, medicine or disease. This led to widespread misinformation, which in turn led people to try to simplify out all the complexity, and trim it down to basic things like &quot;ivermectin doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t take horse medicine when your doctor refuses to prescribe ivermectin to you&quot;.<p>The messaging you think would have &quot;prevented a lot of wasted time&quot; was exactly the messaging in the medical reports that started the whole problem. Dumbing it down was a response to the &quot;internet arguments&quot;.\n\n        I am saying there’s a middle-ground between “long, complex, nuanced” and “ivermectin doesn’t work”, which is useful because as you point out, most people can’t understand the former, but are able to understand abstracts of papers that suggest ivermectin <i>does</i> work, and wonder why they’re being told it doesn’t. Likewise telling people that entertaining the thought that a coronavirus escaped from a lab — in a city that has a lab that studies them — is ridiculous and racist simply opens a huge space for conspiracy peddlers who wonder out-loud and with reasonable justification why this is being dismissed without any nuance at all.<p>Dumbing a message down to contain <i>no</i> nuance — in my opinion — opens up the floor for quacks who will be exploit the lack of nuance on their podcasts.\n\n  Instead of wanting people to ignore Long Covid wouldn&#x27;t it be better to make people more aware of Long Flu?\n\n    We have enough people self diagnosing wrongly already.\n\n  When you look at the Epstein-Barr virus we call the result of the infection all kinds of syndromes.<p>Personally I had Long Epstein-Barr for almost a year. So I know it&#x27;s no joke.<p>Most virus infections can cause long term problems.\n\n    &gt; Most virus infections can cause long term problems.<p>This is very, very false. Your body is currently fighting off a very large number of virus and bacterial infections. Most are innocuous, and don&#x27;t even raise the symptoms of a cold.<p>Now, going out on more of a limb and moving into speculation:<p>There is a tiny minority of diseases -- most very new and poorly-understood -- which do this.<p>There&#x27;s some evidence that prior to around 10,000 BC -- the rise of civilization -- very few diseases like this existed. What appears to have changed was that with civilization -- and now with population density and travel -- diseases can co-evolve with humans, and integrate into our various chemical signalling pathways. Things like Covid or AIDS can explicitly target our immune system, for example, to try to avoid being caught.<p>* Prior to civilization, a successful disease had to work across a broad range of species.<p>* When the population was a fraction of what it is today, there was less opportunity for disease to evolve.<p>* Without travel, there was less opportunity for spread (and for crosstalk between viruses)<p>... and so on.<p>These relatively new diseases can cause long-term problems. There&#x27;s a lot of them, and it&#x27;s not always the same ones as cause acute symptoms!\n\n      Fundamentally, prior to civilization there was not a sustainable host population for human diseases.  Anything that could only target humans would quickly burn out as everyone around would either be dead or resistant from prior infection.<p>As our population grew and contact grew there were enough people around that a disease could sweep through a population then go elsewhere while a new generation grew up to be vulnerable when it finally came back.<p>Even with that, though, most of our disease are minor variants on stuff from the animal world.  Covid appears to be simply the latest iteration of something that has periodically spilled into the human population in the past--except with the extremely nasty trait of asymptomatic spread.  HIV is simply a minor variant on the already-existing SIV.  It learned to target the immune system long before it targeted humans.\n\n      Herpes virus at least has been infecting humans since long before the rise of civilization. Once a person is infected they can remain a contagious carrier for life, so there&#x27;s plenty of opportunity to spread it even with lower population density.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;molbev&#x2F;msu185\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;molbev&#x2F;msu185</a>\n\n    How did you diagnose you had Long Epstein-Barr?\n\n      Not the parent but speaking from (multiple) EB occurances, you can get a mono spot test if it&#x27;s suspected. My last rodeo, it took excluding hepABC, AIDS, cytomegalovirus, and finally a mono spot (along with liver enzymes testing 2x a week for the month I was bedridden...)\n\n  That might make a case for <i>replacing</i> the name but not eliminating it. Eliminating it would be akin to removing the name &quot;stomach cancer&quot; because other cells can also become cancerous.<p>You need a name for things. And long flu might have different etiology than long covid despite similar symptoms, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to lump them together as &quot;long virus&quot;.\n\n    I think replacing it is the way to go. It&#x27;s important to differentiate between the acute symptoms of COVID and the chronic, persistent long-term symptoms, even if they both emanate from the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the body. It will be helpful for research, treatment, and the general understanding of physicians, mental health practitioners in the general public.<p>I think there&#x27;s precedent for such a decision in how concussions are generally viewed. An individual can be diagnosed with a concussion, which has common, acute symptoms. If the acute symptoms last longer than is typical for a concussion of a given severity, the individual could be diagnosed with persistent post-concussive symptoms (a.k.a. post-concussion syndrome). Of course brain injuries are different than viral infections, and we still have a ton to learn about brain injuries, but it&#x27;s the idea of clearly differentiating between the acute effects and the chronic, persistent long-term effects.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not trying to relate COVID with concussions beyond the medical nomenclature, but I think the nomenclature is effective in making the distinction to which I&#x27;m referring. It&#x27;s not perfect, but we&#x27;ll never have perfection in research.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s unclear if the paragraph breaks are displaying properly, so I apologize if it appears as a wall of text.\n\n      &gt;post-concussion syndrome<p>Isn&#x27;t that akin to &quot;long covid&quot;? No one mistakes post-concussion syndrome for a concussion, and no one mistakes long covid for an acute infection.<p>We do have a formal name for long covid: PASC (Post-Acute-Sequaelae of Covid)<p>It won&#x27;t catch on a regular name because it&#x27;s unpronounceable, but it there for the scientific literature and those who wish to speak formally.<p>I&#x27;m open to there being a better way, but ultimately you need something people can refer to, as it is a common phenomenon.\n\n  You could read <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;why-scrapping-the-term-long-covid-would-be-harmful-for-people-with-the-condition-225880\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;why-scrapping-the-term-long-covi...</a> which meets these claims head on and highlights why the research is faulty.

Your linked article does not address the OP article&#x27;s findings.\n\n  Given how poorly-understood post-viral stuff is _in general_, lumping them together at this point feels extremely premature.\n\n  This Medscape article summarizes research on the issue with greater clinical detail. Post infection symptoms appear to depend more on the severity of the infection rather than the particular virus involved.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;993373\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;993373</a>\n\nI’ll share an abridged long COVID story about myself since it dearly affected me. Just so other people can kind of know what the experience was like.<p>I got sick in October 2020 before vaccines were available. After the initial 10 days which I would describe as moderate, borderline severe (6&#x2F;10, where 7&#x2F;10 is hospital and 9&#x2F;10 is ICU) I had all manner of absolutely weird things happen to my body. I won’t go into the details about the actual illness since the symptoms are well documented but suffice to say I had breathing issues and there was a lot of monitoring with the pulse oximeter<p>First, heart pain. Stabbing in the chest. I got on colchicine and saw a cardiologist. That lasted probably 2-3 months before it finally went away. I had ekg and echocardiogram, both came up clean.<p>Second, Reynauds. I live in Texas and it gets a little cold but not Nordic cold. For the first time in my life I had Reynauds symptoms during the winter and I lost feeling in my toes entirely unless they were submerged in hot water for multiple minutes. This happened many times that winter.<p>Next, weird food allergies. Eating anything with gluten caused me to, I kid you not, have me in bed gasping for air for hours at a time. I ate a pizza in this time period and instantly regretted it and that continued for hours.<p>More extremely strange circulatory issues: I wore a pair of running shoes for years and years before I got sick. I wore that same pair of shoes and it created lines and pain around my feet such that I went to the ER thinking it was a blood clot. No, it’s just that my tight shoes literally just bruised my feet for no explainable reason when they had never done that before.<p>POTS. Standing up made my heart rate spike for no reason. This is a measurable phenomena for people who have autoimmune disorders called the tilt table test. Had this for months<p>Everything luckily for me mostly went away within around 6 months. I had a lingering chest pain in breath that is now mostly gone that I genuinely thought I would deal with for the rest of my life. I think it’s basically gone now after almost 4 years.<p>I’m a scientific dude. My conclusion after all this is that it’s autoimmune and that no one actually understands the mechanism which is why people who complain about this get dismissed. It’s easier for a doctor to say “it’s all in your head” than to admit that the current body of knowledge of medicine simply does not understand what is happening to people’s bodies. I wish and hope that so many people suffering from this stuff like I did changes that perspective a bit.\n\n  Several of these (Reynauds, food&#x2F;digestion issues) sound like things that my family member dealt with after long-something-else. He was bedridden for nearly 2 years, diagnosed with CFS, and then (many years later) Lupus.\n\n    This comment just reinforces my belief that it’s autoimmune related. I have never had Reynauds (or ANY of these symptoms) before or after this. It was the first and only time I have ever seen any of the things I mentioned happen to my body. They just… went away and I was normal again eventually, luckily for me. Many aren’t so lucky\n\n      My wife got POTS for the first time in 2022, but we tested and tested and tested, we both never got Covid - but I have been suspecting that the tests were just junk. No other time in our life did her autoimmune issues that basically went away 8 years ago, came back 10x harder. Same thing with almost all of your symptoms. She&#x27;s finally slowly getting better, but she still can&#x27;t eat gluten right now.\n\n        Sorry to hear about your wife. As grandparent comment implies, it’s likely not just COVID that causes these autoimmune problems, but COVID is the thing that most people in recent times got that caused this, so it gets the most press. From my research I discovered that ME&#x2F;CFS&#x2F;Lupus and a lot of other autoimmune related illnesses have been documented in medicine for decades but until COVID the medical field largely considered these illnesses as mostly just a fringe medical phenomena for interested researchers that was blown off by modern medical practitioners because the science to understand it is incomplete. Now that enough people like myself and you on behalf of your wife are out talking about it, the hope is that science will eventually catch up and figure out why this kind of thing happens\n\n        Last year I caught COVID twice. Both times I felt sick, I tested myself daily, and I was negative every time I swabbed my nostrils and nasopharynx. Both times, I started swabbing any yellow mucus that I expelled, and received the positive result that I expected.\n\n  So sorry to hear the way this affected you. My wife had&#x2F;has long covid - as I listened to people she met online with LC and a couple of people we knew already, what fascinated me was the &#x27;menu&#x27; of symptoms that people got and just how different they could be, though overlapping.<p>She too had the POTS and range of aches and issues. While she&#x27;s largely recovered now, she still has to pace herself.<p>Really hoping this is better understood in the future, and that we are better able to treat people with it.\n\n    I’m basically 100% fine now, but thanks. I just wish I could have told the me that existed right when I started having this happen that it would eventually get better. At the time it was very scary thinking that I might have to deal with POTS or shortness of breath for the rest of my life or that my organs were permanently damaged in some way.<p>I find myself more fortunate than most in that I never really had the fatigue and brain fog issues that plagued and possibly still plague many others. I could definitely see those things being quite detrimental to my mental health in the long term if I had them.\n\n      Totally this - am many times as I said &#x27;you will get better from this&#x27; - we both knew that was just a hope.<p>She&#x27;s so much better now, and getting rid of POTS symptoms was a massive turning point for her, esp as we kept being told that no one recovers from POTS.<p>And yes, a friend of mine (male model in his 30s) who also had LC, could cycle for hours (no physical fatigue), but mental tasks totally wiped him out.\n\n  Would it be possible that something else caused it, leading you to also have a more severe episode of COVID? Perhaps you had a preexisting undiagnosed immune disorder, which expressed itself during the COVID episode?\n\n    One of the main theories is that the Covid is hiding in  areas of the body, and this of course will mess with your other immune responses.<p>I experienced something similar to OP.  Took me around 12-18 months before I felt like the symptoms were abating.\n\n    Perhaps, there is a running theory that Covid activates latent Epstein-Barr Virus among other things. But as far as I know it’s just a glorified hypothesis with little scientific evidence to support it.<p>I wouldn’t even classify the actual covid episode I had as severe (and indeed, as far as I could tell from reading reports there doesn’t seem to be strong correlation between severity of illness and whether someone gets long covid or for how long). It was not bad enough to go to the hospital (though I did consider doing so a couple of times).<p>I don’t really get allergies or otherwise and consider myself to have a pretty normal immune system. I get sick at about the same rate as what you would expect a normal person to get sick. My health simply took a v shaped nosedive on a graph for 6 months after I got covid.\n\n  I too believe my long covid symptoms were an autoimmune issue. Read my HN post from 2021 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26350951#26355878\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26350951#26355878</a>\n\n    Interesting that you reported leg&#x2F;muscle pain, having a burning feeling in my leg was also one of the reasons I went to the ER that day thinking I had a blood clot.\n\n  Precisely what happened to me. Doctor botched the disgnosis, my department in local government did everything in their power to push me out immediately upon sharing an honest assesment of how I was feeling, asserting that I was voluntarily resigning rather than genuinely ill - which came across as retaliation for some of them having to return to the office in my stead, as prior to catching covid-19 and suffering the above effects I had been the sole volunteer to work from the office and liase with the public on everyone elses behalf. There wasn’t much if any info about ling covid at the time, and HR ignored emails sent over the next year as I tried to apologize for my illness and communicate what it clearly turned out to be.<p>Completely healthy now, but passed over after every first interview no matter what I do or do not share about what lead me to leave the previous role. If you had to leave work, do you have any suggestions as to how I may come accross as employable again?\n\n    I didn&#x27;t write the parent comment, but I&#x27;d note that being unemployable is a great reason to start your own business, and if you do it right you&#x27;ll never need to answer to anybody again.  (Besides customers, that is, but customers are usually a lot friendlier than HR departments.)<p>Another option would be to pick up freelance work.  This can often lead to fulltime employment, particularly when a company hires you for a short gig and you impress them.\n\n      People generally see work because they need money, and meanwhile a business is one of the biggest money sinks when starting out. I don&#x27;t really understand why people suggest this as general advice. If you&#x27;re not already extremely experienced and established in your field, or if you don&#x27;t have years of savings to live off, I can&#x27;t imagine starting a business impromptu going well. You need a plan.\n\n    I was not working at the time I got sick (for unrelated, voluntary reasons), and ended up having a 2 year gap, at which point when returning and interviewing I essentially told people during interviews that I was “taking care of a sick family member” during my gap period, implying that this was the primary purpose of my gap. I left out that the sick family member happened to be myself. All the responses I got were understanding and no one ever pressed further.\n\n    Don&#x27;t mention health issues in an interview, ever. It&#x27;s unfortunate and really should be illegal to discriminate (not to mention passing up on people who have learned a lot of resilience traits and recovered function) but it&#x27;s pretty much the kiss of death to mention any kind of sickness or chronic issue.\n\n      Yeah. But because it’s not explicitly illegal it is a very easy rejection from the employer. A chronic illness is zero upside and only downside from the employers perspective, so if they aren’t legally obligated to ignore it it’s a very easy no from their perspective. So as the candidate there is basically no reason to ever share that information up front because all it will do is get you basically instantly rejected\n\n  I&#x27;ve had similar symptoms for 7+ years now so it&#x27;s most likely for life. Have seen many infectious disease specialists and CFS&#x2F;ME is the diagnosis (same as long-covid). Mine seems to have been triggered by Glandular Fever (Epstein Barr Virus).<p>Exertion is the biggest trigger for me, but also the prescribed cure (Gradual Exercise Therapy). Alcohol is a weird one, I often feel better with a hangover than I do on a bad fatigue day (immuno-suppressant?) but then way worse the days after. I also have recurring Mononucleosis symptoms and have tried anti-virals to no avail...<p>It&#x27;s so obviously immuno-related, really hope the science progresses soon.<p>Some interesting articles: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gavi.org&#x2F;vaccineswork&#x2F;what-happens-when-you-dont-recover-epstein-barr-virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gavi.org&#x2F;vaccineswork&#x2F;what-happens-when-you-dont...</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;health&#x2F;ron-davis-covid-long-hauler-scn-wellness&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;health&#x2F;ron-davis-covid-lo...</a>\n\n    for those reading, GET is not a&#x2F;the prescribed cure for mecfs, its contraindicated and is no longer broadly recommended (after a lot of controversy). It was once adopted as a recommendation but its the product of faulty science and a medical system that found the disease inconvenient and largely didn&#x27;t want to treat&#x2F;believe it<p>really sorry you&#x27;re dealing w mecfs insaider, i feel your pain\n\n  &gt; <i>My conclusion after all this is that it’s autoimmune and that no one actually understands the mechanism which is why people who complain about this get dismissed.</i><p>Sicknesses caused by viruses are known to cause lingering &quot;fatigue syndrome&quot; in rare cases, so I&#x27;d be surprised if doctors would just flatly dismiss it. There probably is no such specific thing as &quot;long covid&quot;, its just this syndrome that was always a thing.\n\n  I strongly urge anyone dealing with these issues to look into the gut biome as a source of clues and experimentation. A lot is not known about the gut biome but we&#x27;re discovering many autoimmune and autoimmune-like conditions are related to it.<p>Some things to do: get biome tests regularly, go on an elimination diet, find the right supplements, join various LC&#x2F;mecfs communities doing this work.<p>The short answer is the medical system really doesn&#x27;t know what to do here and if you&#x27;re dealing w this stuff you <i>have</i> to take it into your own hands and familiarize yourself with the areas the medical system doesn&#x27;t focus on.\n\n    I am dealing with brand-new-to-me gut problems this year (I&#x27;m overall a fairly fit and healthy guy) and I now completely understand why people seek all kinds of zany alternative pseudoscientific treatments: we have next to no idea what we&#x27;re doing when it comes to gut health and wellness, and the personal impact can be enormous.  I am fortunately able to continue working, but many or most people are not so fortunate and truly struggle, and financial and personal difficulties can hit fast and hard when you can&#x27;t function the way you need to.  So many people in the United States are desperate and have so few options.  Our health and employment problems in this country are not just a tragedy but a crisis that has been growing for many years.\n\n  &gt; POTS. Standing up made my heart rate spike for no reason. This is a measurable phenomena for people who have autoimmune disorders called the tilt table test. Had this for months.<p>Same!  I was diagnosed with syncope on standing.  Every time I stood up from a reclining position, my heart would pound and the world would start fading to black.  I too was referred to a cardiologist and had the tests performed.  And it also cleared up for me but it took a long time (months).<p>That wasn&#x27;t my only symptom.  I am completely scientific also.  I know about how SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 receptors, I know about how it lodges itself in multiple organs ... and the symptoms were real.<p>This was another one where I didn&#x27;t even think &quot;Covid&quot; when I went to the doctor, but this all coincided with a recent Covid infection.\n\n  Damn dude. What a ride. I did have those back stabbing pains and headaches like someone took a drill and pushed it agains the back of my head. Crazy outcome. These relatable stories hit very close. I can feel your pain. What made my brain fog go away was the timing and a session of adderall and mild exercise. 2020 was wild.\n\n  Thank you for sharing your story. What people don’t realize is that long covid is a fate worse than death, and that’s not very well represented well in the statistics. So we look at the death statistics and say Covid really isn’t that scary. Wrong, it’s worse than that. I wouldn’t wish long covid on anyone (except long covid deniers).\n\nSARS-CoV-2 not only infects the brain it continues to replicate inside neurons. Evidence of this featured just days ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;danibeckman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1769569843760763120\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;danibeckman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1769569843760763120</a>\n\nPerhaps then we should stop ignoring the potential effects of the ongoing airborne pandemic. But no, keep f*king around with COVID, and we keep finding out.\n\n  There is no ongoing pandemic. There is now an <i>en</i>demic virus that&#x27;s part of the regular rotation of pathogens that cause colds and flu, and covid doesn&#x27;t seem particularly more dangerous than the rest (NB: influenza can be very nasty too! I&#x27;m not minimizing the harm of covid).<p>The pandemic was a unique situation because the entire world population was immuno-naive to covid. This is no longer the case; we all get exposed dozens of times per year and keep our natural immunity up.\n\n    the distinction between pandemic and endemic is political and typically related to “we don’t care to contain it”. It’s not related to immunity levels. The interesting thing is that it used to be citizens of poorer countries who would be fodder, now it’s also the richer ones which I think says something about the state of those countries and progress in general\n\n      I wouldn&#x27;t say so much that we don&#x27;t care to contain it, but that pandemic means it&#x27;s sweeping over a population, endemic means it&#x27;s simply always present in the population without major swings in prevalence.  Impossible to contain because it&#x27;s already everywhere.\n\n        ‘impossible to’ doesn’t really fit into my idea of the HN crowd.<p>It’s cost&#x2F;benefit and leaders took the ‘keep the graph going up and to the right next quarter’ approach to the long term risks.<p>Containment is of course possible, it would just take technology improvements for diagnostic tests and education and investment in air quality.<p>The calculation is that saving the years of ill health aren’t worth disrupting the status quo<p>Edit: What’s the difference between sweeping over and always present? Whether we test and report it in the news or not?\n\n          So it&#x27;s possible, but not a single country in the world managed to do it, even with wide range of different political parties in power, alignment, economic systems, etc? Like if literally every single combination that we have of those things couldn&#x27;t manage effective containment....Well I guess your claim is a bit unfalsifiable don&#x27;t you think?<p>And the &quot;chart goes&quot; up is such a strawman, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no real life downside or long term risk to just shut down everything for (2) more weeks... but whatever. That&#x27;s such a western mentality, that only comes with the privilege of not living in an economically ruined part of the world.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why doomers and &quot;zero COVID&quot; proponents are usually in the vast majority white, privileged, urban residents. I&#x27;m sure some vague, very broad &quot;long term risks&quot; that we still haven&#x27;t seen concretely outside of a tiny minority (even if hundreds of millions were infected) are more important than the actual, proven,  repeated risks of &quot;charts going down&quot;.<p>In a way there&#x27;s an odd parallel with antivaxxers who love to claim that in just a little bit more we will see the long term risks that came with the vaccine lol\n\n          Human compliance isn&#x27;t perfect.  Without China-level enforcement all lockdowns were leaky.  There&#x27;s a point of can&#x27;t.<p>Furthermore, Covid has animal hosts.  Even if the would could cooperate on completely stamping it out it would soon jump back from some animal.  We simply have to live with it, take what precautions you want in your personal life but there&#x27;s no point in society at large doing so.<p>(I do, however, think that medical facilities should be mask-required.  But I think they should have been pre-pandemic, also.)\n\n    The difference between a pandemic and an endemic is that we don&#x27;t want to stop an endemic. The virus is the same; the effects are the same but more averaged out with fewer peaks and troughs; they are just as bad.\n\n      &gt; is that we don&#x27;t want to stop an endemic.<p>In my opinion, there&#x27;s no significant levers left to push to affect infection rates much.<p>Of course, we should be doing everything reasonable we can to tamp down COVID (and the flu).  But short of permanent quarantine or forcing anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated, I&#x27;m not sure what there&#x27;s left to do.<p>(It would be nice if we could socially normalize and encourage wearing a mask when one feels slightly sick, too).\n\n        Don’t force people into offices, and solve a bit of the climate crisis too\n\n    Are you saying influenza and common cold also break down the blood brain barrier? Because that is what the new news is that the OP is about.\n\n      No, I&#x27;m saying that they also have a comparable rate of post-viral syndrome, and a comparable rate of severe cases. It is not clear at all at this point if covid will be able to do this much damage to the next generation (whose first exposure was as babies). Maybe this blood brain barrier thing is something that all viruses do if the immune system doesn&#x27;t respond appropriately. I genuinely don&#x27;t know.\n\n        No, this breakdown of the blood brain barrier is unique, which makes it curious to dismiss as &quot;not more dangerous than the rest&quot;\n\n    Covid causes a lot more deaths and a lot more damage than the flu.  The flu is simply unpleasant for the vast majority of those who are otherwise reasonably healthy.  Covid is still doing lasting damage to such people.\n\nFor me, it&#x27;s like the volume of my inner voice is decreased, and no sign of recovery after 2 years, though no significant cognitive function decline can be observed.\n\n  Just curious: Do you spend much time reading news, watching podcasts, or YouTube videos? I&#x27;ve noticed a similar thing in myself and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to COVID or if it&#x27;s because of this news addition.\n\n    Depression and isolation maybe?\n\n      No isolation, no depression, definitely :)\n\n  I&#x27;m fascinated by people&#x27;s inner monologues (I don&#x27;t have one), so forgive my curiosity: is what you describe a bad thing? Have you noticed changes in your patterns of reasoning?\n\n    No, not much. It may make you feel foggy for a while, but when you get used to or just ignore it, nothing actually changed. My understanding is inner monologue is just some side effect rather than necessary part of thought.\n\n    And I am fascinated by people _not_ having inner monologues, as I do have a very active inner voice. For me having inner voice is like one part of me does the talking, the other does the listening. If other people could listen, they would probably say that I&#x27;m a crazy dude, doing all that talk. When I see people talking loud, I call them crazy, thank god I do not project my voice outwards!<p>But sometimes, things come to my mind without talking at all, and it is usually more profound things, or things that trigger a more profound emotion. Regarding self-knowledge or when doing introspection, I confess that having a inner monologue is not effective at all, at least to me.<p>Can I ask how you &quot;work&quot; mentally? For instance, supposing you&#x27;re a software developer, how do you go thorough learning a new thing about a programming language? I usually talk to myself things like &quot;suppose I do this here, and..&quot;. It is like I am pair-programming with the other half of my brain.<p>Hope you don&#x27;t mind me asking! Is just curiosity (and the fact that the inner monologue sometimes may do more harm than good)..\n\n      Of course, happy to discuss. You have me stumped though, I actually can&#x27;t articulate how I work. If what I&#x27;m doing requires extreme care, such as pushing configuration updates to production, I will mentally say out loud what I&#x27;m planning to do (probably something similar to [0]), but calling that voice is a conscious effort. Normally I&#x27;ll follow a vague &quot;feeling&quot; of what needs to happen. I think my mind works directly with abstract concepts or mental representations of what I&#x27;m focusing on.<p>&gt; &quot;suppose I do this here, and..&quot;<p>Sure, I will follow the same pattern, but the drive to fiddle with something bubbles up from some abstract place. Words don&#x27;t even come into play.<p>Do you also subvocalize when reading text?<p>This topic is a fickle beast. The only baseline I have is my own cognition -- I can&#x27;t say &quot;yeah it&#x27;s like what you&#x27;re doing only...&quot; -- I am fundamentally unable to experience your way of thinking. We are blobs of fat oxymoronically trying to explain our subjective experience in an objective way through our 2nd languages (lossy doesn&#x27;t even beign to describe it). It&#x27;s absurd but oh so fascinating.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pointing_and_calling\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pointing_and_calling</a>\n\n        Wait, you have no &quot;inner voice&quot; at all?<p>I don&#x27;t understand.  Thought experiment:<p>You go to a wall and there is a picture hanging on the wall.  You like the picture.  Can you &quot;say&quot; in your head without using your voice&#x2F;mouth &quot;I like this picture&quot;?<p>If you have to use your voice, can you mimic the tongue movement without moving your mouth and &quot;hear&quot; the words without making a sound?\n\n          I can conjure up a voice in my head and make it say anything I want, such as &quot;I like this picture&quot;, but it&#x27;s a contrived and unnatural thing for me to do. It takes effort and &quot;takes over&quot; my whole brain. If a picture on the wall catches my eye, I will just enjoy it. Maybe that&#x27;s why I struggle to answer &quot;oh, what do you like about this picture?&quot;, because nothing about my experience had any relation to words at all.<p>I normally don&#x27;t talk very much, maybe that&#x27;s why? Maybe my though process is further removed from language than that of most other people?\n\n          For me it&#x27;s like my head has a large cluster of art that I&#x27;ve seen, all organized. It is the &quot;memory palace&quot; basically, if you&#x27;ve heard of that approach to memorizing things. Except my memory palace is very, very large, and it has an area for art that I&#x27;ve seen.<p>If I appreciate a piece of art then it goes into my memory palace collection in a room that groups it together with other similar pieces of art that I had a similar appreciation for. As I appreciate the piece of art my memory palace branches out from there in many directions. I&#x27;m recalling other similar pieces of art (how does this art rank compared to other pieces I&#x27;ve appreciated). I&#x27;m recalling other pieces of art by the same artist (how did this art compare to their other works). I&#x27;m recalling similar artists of the time period (how did this work compare to art by contemporary artists). I&#x27;m imagining the techniques that were used to make the art, whether dramatic and physical (splashes of paint in a modern art piece) or precise and delicate (such as the fine brush strokes). This is the process of appreciation I feel.<p>Basically, the &quot;I like this picture&quot; is a very visual experience for me, not a vocal experience at all. If I did not like the picture then I just look at it, have an internal feeling of &quot;meh&quot; or &quot;boredom&quot; and do not put any effort into memorization or related recall and connectivity of the memory.\n\n        &gt; If what I&#x27;m doing requires extreme care, such as pushing configuration updates to production, I will mentally say out loud what I&#x27;m planning to do (probably something similar to [0]), but calling that voice is a conscious effort.<p>Yes, mentally say out loud is what I&#x27;m talking about. And sometimes it&#x27;s a conscious effort as well, definitely. But it doesn&#x27;t require much effort from my part. Well, it requires so little effort, that sometimes I catch my mind talking to itself, without the other part really listening. So, sometimes it is not a conscious effort. My reasoning is that maybe some of the thoughts seem to trigger some part of the brain that is used for vocabulary, and they express themselves &quot;vocally&quot; (but without any sound)..<p>&gt; Do you also subvocalize when reading text?<p>When reading text, and now by replying to you. English is not my native language, so I must &quot;vocalize&quot; the words internally, and then write them as they &quot;sound&quot; in my brain. I&#x27;ve been doing this for such a long time that is feels quite natural to me. And when I&#x27;m less rusty (specially when talking), I tend to skip the &quot;inner&quot; voice and project directly to the &quot;outer&quot; voice. But it only happens when I&#x27;m having lots of conversations in English. I haven&#x27;t been writing or talking in EN too much lately, so I have to use my inner voice as intermediate step. As for reading, most of the time I read using my &quot;inner&quot; voice, both for English as for Portuguese (which is my native language).\n\n      For me my internal monologue is replaced by almost entirely images. For example, if I&#x27;m learning about something in a programming language I&#x27;m mentally diagramming components and imagining how data structures are laid out as a network of items. To the extent that I do verbal thinking while programming it&#x27;s usually just a internal vocalization for an interjection I would otherwise be tempted to say out loud like &quot;why the fuck is this not working, this SDK is trash&quot;. And I only say it to myself internally so as not to interrupt other people around me.<p>For other things that are less abstract, with a concrete real world appearance, I&#x27;m constantly visualizing the outcome like I&#x27;m looking at a picture or watching a movie. This also applies to the &quot;things that come to my mind without talking&quot;, which you mention. They drift into appearance in my mind as images as well.\n\n  Your comment just made me realize this has happened to me. I used to have lively conversations in my head and they&#x27;re very muted now. I&#x27;ve also been dealing with brain fog since getting COVID.\n\nHad brain fog in the first year.<p>One of the issues now\n\nI was affected by this &quot;brain fog&quot; after getting Covid, but I didn&#x27;t put two and two together.<p>I called my doctor&#x27;s office to schedule an appointment and when the receptionist asked what the appointment was for, I simply said &quot;brain fog&quot;.  I had no other way to describe it.<p>It was intense and disturbing.  I often couldn&#x27;t put cohererent thoughts together, I was constantly forgetting what I was doing, forgetting where I had just put something.<p>Over the coming weeks it slowly receded, but there&#x27;s no doubt it is real.<p>I&#x27;ve had people dismiss it as &quot;it&#x27;s all in your mind&quot;.  They&#x27;re right on some level ... it was in my mind.  But it was very real, and I have no doubt it was SARS-CoV-2 related due to the timing and sheer intensity of it.\n\n  Do you still feel like this? Is there anything that helped you?\n\n    I wrote a longer comment in this thread about things that helped me, you can find it in my comment history.\n\n  Not that this it&#x27;s a good excuse, but it stressed doctors out when they are not able to diagnose something. So when all the tests and checks look good they are quick to dismiss the problems as psychosomatic as a way to cope with the stress of being unable to diagnose you.<p>It&#x27;s a dysregulation of the ANS&#x2F;sympathetic nervous system which is likely caused by auto antibodies - so it&#x27;s very much physiological and outside the expertise of a psychiatrist.\n\n    While you are right, there is a common misconception that psychosomatic means that the patient is making up its symptoms and that it’s in his mind. That’s not what a doctor means by psychosomatic, but rather than the symptoms are totally real but that they are originating from stress.<p>So, any good doctor will try to heal your symptoms regardless of the cause. The only difference when they think it’s psychosomatic is that they’ll also try to treat your stress.\n\n      Or perhaps &#x27;the patient is creating symptoms using their mind&#x27; eh?<p>The symptoms exist, they are originating due to thoughts&#x2F;beliefs in the mind.\n\n    Yup.  Most doctors are basically glorified pigeonholers.  Grab pigeon (patient), find matching hole, put pigeon in hole and read the directions on the hole.<p>Unfortunately, when there isn&#x27;t an obvious matching hole they tend to stuff them in wrong holes (there are conditions for which getting the right diagnosis often takes years), or when they don&#x27;t see any appropriate hole they stuff them in the &quot;crazy&quot; hole.  And the doctors are very reluctant to take a pigeon out of a wrong hole, especially if it&#x27;s the crazy hole.<p>I recall a thread on here from some years back, diagnosis: anorexia.  Real diagnosis: partial gastroparesis.  She didn&#x27;t want to eat because her body wasn&#x27;t pushing the food on down the system properly and eating was very unpleasant!\n\n    &gt; physiological and outside the expertise of a psychiatrist<p>did you mean to say psychologist? In the US at least,  psychiatry is a medical practice area. Writing Rx scrips requires pharmacological training, so you need to hold an MD amd pass medical boards etc.  Not sure if DO route is even an option.<p>Psychology otoh can be practixed with a Psy.D (clinical focus)  or Ph.D (research focus)  no MD, residency involved.\n\n  I&#x27;ve been getting this since having kids and I called it brain fog too because I didn&#x27;t know how else to describe it as well.  Tests all came back negative.  I now just attribute it to exhaustion and lack of sleep, but I find as I get older the symptoms come fast if I don&#x27;t sleep enough or I get sick and my body isn&#x27;t 100%.\n\n    Did you get your Testosterone checked?  There are studies showing men lower T levels when babies are born, if you were already low it could be a issue.\n\n      Yes, testosterone was checked and came back normal.\n\n    I had this as well and was diagnosed with sleep apnea. Sleep with a CPAP machine now and it has made a huge difference in my life.\n\nis there a way to test for this?\n\ni will never understand our civilization *** up priorities. we should have spent 100+ billion dollars solving this instead of on twitter and VR.\n\n  Instead, we had some people in positions of power pushing theories that COVID was a hoax because it was inconvenient for their businesses.\n\n  That would have been economically damaging: where&#x27;s the profit in doing that, and how would that help people get back into offices and kids into schools so the adults can stay focused at work<p>If we wanted billions spent on public health we can&#x27;t leave it to politicians and business leaders\n\nLong COVID is horrible. I have had it for three years. I follow the research quite closely and wrote a book about what we know about it, how it affects someone and their health, and some observations on how absurd of a condition it is from the lens of someone struggling with it.<p>Here’s a free digital copy if anyone wants to read it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jondouglas.dev&#x2F;longhaul\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jondouglas.dev&#x2F;longhaul</a>\n\n  Thank you. I have it too and having something to reference is invaluable.\n\n    Ugh, so sorry to hear that. I&#x27;m an email away if you ever want to chat about it.\n\nAh yes, leaky brain syndrome.\n\nI had this, but not too badly.<p>I started taking a brain-support supplement and it has made a dramatic improvement. Kind of like my senses, reflexes, energy have all been enhanced basically back to what they were before I got infected with this crap.<p>Edit - I&#x27;ll just say what I&#x27;m taking. It&#x27;s called &quot;Sharpmind - Brain Formula&quot; by Solaray. I don&#x27;t have any hard evidence, but I started feeling pretty close to the &quot;before times&quot; after a few days of taking it. ymmv\n\nI&#x27;ve had good success using cerebrolysin. Involves injecting yourself with pig brains though.\n\nWhen I was younger I never understood the old saw about mathematicians doing their best work in their 20s, or other similar observations .... I thought it was strange, since being older means you had more time to get more experience.<p>Now after experiencing the pandemic... I suspect a small part of the reason for things like this maybe is they younger you are, the less chance you&#x27;ve had the misfortune to experience some infection or another that left you with some mild mental impairment -- including perhaps impairments so small that no individual would notice it in themselves, but in the statistical aggregate, it has an impact.<p>As far as knowledge and wisdom go, older is better.\nBut raw intelligence or processing power, or most of all, the one that really seems to impact everything -- working set size! -- maybe every year is only ever one more chance to get worse, and never to get better?"

Typically you don’t see the axis labels rearranged like in the OP but instead coordinate systems described as y-up or z-up. Similarly left and right handed.\n\n    Well, it&#x27;s about the order. In vanilla Minecraft client you see height as the second coordinate out of the three.\n\n      Right because vanilla Minecraft uses y-up, so the second value ‘y’ represents height.\n\n  The comment is somewhat misleading.<p>Minecraft uses (x,y,z), and uses the &#x27;y&#x27; coordinate for height (not &#x27;z&#x27;). This is very common for exactly the reasons you outline.<p>Also, flipping two coordinates changes the handedness of the system. OpenGL uses left-handed coordinates while Minecraft uses right-handed.

      "conversation_text": "In fairness, nuking a chunk of Nevada was what the early 1950s called &quot;Tuesday&quot;.\n\n  There was some book I read--thought it was We Swam the Grand Canyon but can&#x27;t find the scene--when the author was camped over by Lake Mead somewhere and was awoken by the flash and sound of an atomic test. There&#x27;s a pretty neat Atomic Test Museum in Vegas.\n\nOver nine hundred nuclear weapons, many of larger size, were detonated in Nevada from the early 1950s to 1992. The way the article presents that aspect is odd and suggests an author surprisingly unaware of the history of Nevada and the weapons program.<p>I actually find it somewhat surprising the weapon-stimulated experiment was never attempted, as these kinds of experiments were conducted secondarily to a weapons test fairly routinely. A large portion of Nevada tests supported secondary research by other government agencies, universities, and private industry. A prominent example was a set of buildings to test earthquake-hardening methods, taking advantage of the consistent earthquakes incidentally produced by nuclear tests. I believe the client on that project was the University of California, but that&#x27;s from memory and sources are hard to come by on older NNSS programs.<p>One of the more famous commercial tests was by the  Mosler safe company to demonstrate that their vaults could survive a nuclear attack, although this wasn&#x27;t totally an independent project as Mosler had a close relationship with the military and the survivability of their vaults had implications on nuclear deterrence, their being used to store parts of the weapons stockpile.\n\n  - <i>&quot;Mosler had a close relationship with the military and the survivability of their vaults had implications on nuclear deterrence&quot;</i><p>&#x2F;tangent That&#x27;s the brand of safe Los Alamos used to store nuclear secrets during the Manhattan Project, which Richard Feynman practiced safe-cracking on,<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.virginia.edu&#x2F;cs588&#x2F;safecracker.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.virginia.edu&#x2F;cs588&#x2F;safecracker.pdf</a> (excerpt from <i>&quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;</i>)\n\nFor context:<p><pre><code>    The United States conducted around 1,054 nuclear tests (by official count) between 1945 and 1992, including 216 atmospheric, underwater, and space tests.\n</code></pre>\na good number of these were within USofA, in Nevada, and several drifted fallout across US population centres.<p>&quot;Nearly bombed Nevada&quot; is a small claim next to &quot;actually bombed Nevada&quot; .. or &quot;detonated an atmospheric bomb and used it as a backdrop for a showgirl&quot; (1953)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.nuclearsecrecy.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;friday-image-the-dixie-showgirl-1953&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.nuclearsecrecy.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;friday-image-the-...</a>\n\n  I love the fact that the details of the photo were provided by a Russian.

      "conversation_text": "While I new that the shell has emacs-style bindings I didn&#x27;t know these were really readline based and supported things like undo. I should go read up on more readline keybindings.\n\nI’ve come to believe that time spent on organizational tools and processes is a form of procrastination that’s actually detrimental to focus and productivity. I found much more focus and productivity after I read 4000 weeks and switched to just using a text file for notes and planning.\n\n  I completely see your point, and my boring response is &quot;it depends&quot;. How heavily I rely on my personal organizational setup depends a lot on context. For instance, at $WORK I need time-tracking and tracability of tasks due to audits. Having a system I barely have to think about is crucial to me in this setting not to waste time in horribly slow web-based ERP-systems. For personal projects I stick to a single text file of issues and ideas. Knowing what to use when is part of the general assessment imo.\n\n    For me, the crucial part is to create a tool&#x2F;script that just gets one task done as fast as possible. I don&#x27;t need tools that can do everything. Often it&#x27;s just a bash script that executes like 5 commands to execute&#x2F;build something, so that I don&#x27;t even have to think about those steps and don&#x27;t forget one.<p>Tho it is a really fine line to not get hung up on those organizational tasks, yes.\n\n  It&#x27;s similar to me wanting to get fit by spending a whole day deciding which trainers to buy, then never wearing them. The illusion of progress.\n\n    I felt this one.\n\n    There&#x27;s a flip side: you can focus all of your time on &#x27;working hard&#x27; but never pay attention to how you&#x27;re doing it.<p>In fitness this might be more like: you spend all your time jogging in terrible shoes, working &quot;comfortably hard&quot; and pushing through the pain.<p>Instead you could spend a few hours researching modern training approaches and running techniques and change the entire trajectory of what you could achieve as an athlete. You can change the focus of how you work, reduce wasted or ineffectual energy and put that into dedicated efforts that have maximal payoff.<p>This debate is as old as work itself though, and I&#x27;m probably not changing any minds here.\n\n      Yes, this is &quot;sharpening the saw&quot;. But we all know people who, despite boasting a lot about their extremely sharp saw, chop zero trees. Balance, in all things.\n\n        &gt; Balance, in all things.<p>Maybe - but if so, also balance in being balanced. Sometimes &quot;going hard&quot; is needed to make a deadline. And sometimes when you&#x27;re burned out, you need to do zero work for awhile.<p>I think the better advice is something like: &quot;Be present with the actual moment. Listen to the world and then take the right next action thats actually needed.&quot;. Sometimes the next action is sharpening the saw. Sometimes its playing with your kids, or taking a nap, or finally chopping that tree. Its impossible to know whats needed without being actually present with whats going on right now.\n\n  My advice is too start on paper (notebook, planner) until you find your workflow. If you can’t because it can be cumbersome, use a set of tools like Apple’s default until the pain points prove unbearable. Then you choose something more suitable. I myself have settled on Bear and Things, but that’s because they introduce joy in my workflow (beautiful softwares). But I can replicate my system using any tools, including paper.\n\n  This has been my experience using Obsidian and many other similar tools. I&#x27;ve settled on text files sync&#x27;d using iCloud. There being whole books, podcasts, courses, etc. about what I&#x27;m doing with a lot of .txt files really supports the idea that it&#x27;s mostly procrastination. (And, yes, I&#x27;m procrastinating by replying on HN.)\n\n  I&#x27;ve tried to do the todo.txt thing but not being able to sketch or paste in photos or screenshots was a bit of a blocker. Apple Notes with the Pencil stylus is ideal for me right now.\n\n  I spent a few hours automating some repetitive tasks in a way that takes almost the entire burden off of my brain. Then I wired it up to a Stream Deck so these things can notify me asynchronously and easily run in parallel.<p>That was a pretty simple investment, but a total game changer, it saves me gobs of time every month, and was a no-brainer investment.<p>Granted, not all dev workflows are as annoyingly complex as mine, but nonetheless: you&#x27;re statement is all-encompassing when in fact it&#x27;s very context dependent. In my case, your advice was simply not true.\n\n    What type of tasks ?  This sounds really interesting?\n\n      Long running async stuff where I want to be notified when it&#x27;s done.<p>Things like:\n - run all the functional tests\n - rebuild a docker image\n - rebuild the docker image AND run all the tests AND reformat the code ...<p>It&#x27;s such a simple idea, but super useful. Think something like this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesridgway&#x2F;devdeck\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesridgway&#x2F;devdeck</a><p>I haven&#x27;t made it publically available, as it&#x27;s SUPER raw&#x2F;tailored for me.\n\n    I didn&#x27;t mean to provide advice or make an all-encompassing statement. I just said what has been true for me.\n\n  The threshold is much different for an individual vs a team.<p>The more minds and hands there are, the more a repeatable, consistent process is needed.\n\n  This is absolutely a failure mode that can happen and I think people should be aware of it&#x2F;be cautious about not falling into the trap, but I don&#x27;t think this is categorically true, if for no other reason due to the extreme differences in how people think.<p>I&#x27;ve absolutely spent time procrastinating by hunting for the perfect tool, and it took me some time to realize that. But I&#x27;ve also found that a good tool can be a force multiplier that can make a huge difference in productivity and more importantly, the likelihood that I&#x27;ll stick with something.<p>I&#x27;ve tried and failed numerous times to succeed with a simple text note. I love the idea of the simplicity. But I could never make it work.<p>A few years back I learned that I have aphantasia - my mind&#x27;s eye is blind. When digging into this, I learned that people&#x27;s ability to visualize is a spectrum, and while I&#x27;m on one extreme end of it, there is a huge variance in how people experience the act of thinking. It made me realize why &lt;thing&gt; that worked for &lt;person&gt; never worked for me, and why you&#x27;ll find so many people evangelizing &lt;specific approach&gt; because it worked for them.<p>I&#x27;ve learned that tools that help me visualize my thoughts completely change my relationship with them and help unlock deeper thinking. Over time, I&#x27;ve realized that some tools really are &quot;tools for thought&quot;. My brain can&#x27;t do X, but Y tool can, and it becomes part of my extended conscious experience and enables me to do things I couldn&#x27;t before.<p>I think the critical factor here is to be honest with yourself about what is or is not actually working for you. Recognize the trap of trying to solve problems with tools that aren&#x27;t really going to change much. But do use tools that help.\n\n    What tools&#x2F;methods have you found that help with aphantasia?\n\n      For awhile, I was using Miro. The infinite canvas made it possible to start arranging information visually and made it easier to load things back into memory when I’d come back to a project later. I still love it, but prefer something local and less proprietary.<p>Currently, I’m pretty all-in on Obsidian. I don’t have a crazy setup with tons of plugins and I’m not building complex data tables or anything like that.<p>I use:<p>- Daily journal note to jot down thoughts and what I’m working on or thinking about each day<p>- Very actively use [[Link Syntax]] in notes to create placeholder connections to unexplored ideas or real connections to existing notes<p>- I use the Canvas feature to visually arrange things and love that I can embed notes into the canvas or start a local card on the canvas and later convert it to a standalone note<p>- I occasionally use the note graph view to see how previous journal notes cluster around specific topics. I know some people find this part of Obsidian gimmicky, but for me, it helps me find common threads and identify interrelated ideas<p>- I focus on creating small notes that I can grok quickly and rely on note-to-note connections to navigate larger topics<p>I don’t know how much of this workflow is directly applicable to Aphantasia, but the canvas feature in particular is where I feel like I get the most value in terms of visualizing what I otherwise can’t.<p>I also use tools like Figma&#x2F;Balsamiq to get product ideas out of my head. It’s crazy how different things can be once they go from an abstract notion of “an interface that does X” to an actual drawing of an interface that does X.<p>If there was ever a tool like Miro that I could run locally, I’d use it extensively. Just a nice big toolbox of different ways to visualize things.\n\n        &gt; If there was ever a tool like Miro that I could run locally, I’d use it extensively.<p>Does Excalidraw[1] fit the bill?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;excalidraw&#x2F;excalidraw\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;excalidraw&#x2F;excalidraw</a>\n\n          It gets me partway there. The thing that I really liked about Miro is that is has tools ranging from kanban boards to data tables to icon libraries and is sort of a jack of all trades sort of tool that goes beyond just drawing and adds structure to some of the elements you can put on the canvas.<p>This makes it really easy to transition between quick wireframes, sequence diagrams, sticky notes, to structured data, tasks with rich cards, statuses, etc. I haven’t found a good direct replacement yet.<p>I do need to give excalidraw another look because I think there’s a decent Obsidian integration and I could probably approach some of the things I was doing with Miro in a more Obsidian-centric way.\n\n          There is an Obsidian integration also\n\n    Thank you for this nuanced view.<p>I honestly didn&#x27;t want the post to center around the organizational bit, it was a late addition, because there&#x27;s the caveat that it gets interpreted as &quot;this is how you gain productivity&quot;. In my specific case it&#x27;s more about flushing thoughts that otherwise would continue to drift in my mind. This is also why I write. It&#x27;s calming due to the fact it allows me to lay things to rest.<p>&gt; I think the critical factor here is to be honest with yourself about what is or is not actually working for you.<p>Yes, and in order to do so you need to do the occasional introspection and be a mindful of your ways. We all have our quirks and it&#x27;s also fine to acknowledge this. I still have plenty of &quot;bad habits&quot;, many which I have no intention of breaking any time soon.\n\n    Yep, I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest this was my advice for all people, it&#x27;s just what has worked for me.\n\n      Yes. And that&#x27;s also the risk I run with including such anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot; from my own process, because it definitely won&#x27;t click with everybody.<p>I&#x27;ve witnessed people close to me be highly successful with the &quot;single file&quot; approach that you yourself swear by. My point was that most people probably will have some benefit of choosing <i>some</i> approach, and not try to keep it all in your head.\n\n  But I am finding my TickTick subscription very handy because it runs across platforms, and integrates with calendars, and provides reminders and views.<p>I can&#x27;t do that with TXT files near as easily.\n\nPreviously, I also used various so-called tiling window managers and configuring lots of shortcuts to improve my typing efficiency. Now, I mainly focus on researching how to use GPT to generate code ..\nPerhaps, in the future, using GPT effectively to generate code and documentation could create many 10x or even 20x programmers.\n\n  Maybe I just haven&#x27;t used those &quot;enough&quot; yet, but I don&#x27;t feel like chatGPT and others increase my productivity. Yes, they are nice to get some quick sketches&#x2F;outlines, but that&#x27;s about it. I rarely use them. Most building blocks are stored in my head by now and I don&#x27;t even have to think about them.\n\n    I&#x27;ve found it most useful for generating code I don&#x27;t have to maintain (one-off scripts) and lots of regex stuff.\n\n  It may not be the same for everybody, but I once tracked 6 months with normal mouse usage, 6 months without but a lot of shortcuts... Do you know how much time I saved? Roughly 2 hours.<p>I still use them and I do it without mouse whenever I can, mostly for everyday ergonomics, but I use the mouse when I really need to without thinking how I could do it without it. It’s important to take breaks too, longer-Pomodoro helps.<p>As with GenAI, I’m already doing documentation with it. I pass it some YAML file or my own previous documentation, ask it to generate an organized version, I review it and edit it, and that’s it. For writing unit tests it’s been really helpful in environments where there is no QuickCheck or something that generates tests.<p>Yes, it’s about using them efficiently, but we have to make sure it’s actually providing the positive impact we expected it to create.\n\n    &gt; but I once tracked 6 months with normal mouse usage, 6 months without but a lot of shortcuts... Do you know how much time I saved? Roughly 2 hours.<p>I’d be interested in techniques&#x2F;tools you used to measure the time saved. Your point is extremely important and a discussion around measuring the positive impact would be helpful.\n\nThe distractions and breaking focus is part of how I program. When I&#x27;m trying to solve a difficult problem, getting away and thinking about other things usually makes a solution bubble up, and then I sit down and pour out something working fairly quickly.<p>My only org tool is a journal i keep in a Google spreadsheet (shortcut on phone home screen) where i note hours and log what i&#x27;ve accomplished, fails, questions, and ideas. I&#x27;ve never been so unstressed organized as a programmer now that I use this very low effort journal.\n\n  I work in a similar way. If I focus on a problem for too long at a stretch, I find myself running in circles. I have to break things up with a distraction, oddly said distraction being a different problem, sometimes. It&#x27;s uncanny how solving one smaller issue lets me get back to the larger one with a fresh take.<p>As for the journaling part, not so much. I&#x27;ve tried a few methods, but either they don&#x27;t jive with the variety of tasks I have to track, or they end up being couched in an app that makes the process a slog. What I&#x27;d love to see is some simple, customizable, text-based project management software that can be cloud or local hosted, but like others have said, I risk falling into that trap of hunting for that perfect tool.<p>So, notebook and pen it is, for now.\n\nThis essay resonates as it touches upon many long conversations I&#x27;ve had with a friend around our attempts to create a postmodern PKM system strung together with glue code, duct tape, and bailing wire while juggling chainsaws and bowling balls as GPT infrastructure exploded in the post-COVID era.<p>In particular, I&#x27;ve found myself drawn to my early enculturation around the dichotomy of control implied by the mouse&#x27;s Cartesian implications on what has increasingly been a 3-dimensional or n-dimensional thought space in the spectrum from API to GUI to HCI.<p>LSS: the faster I type the slower the distraction of mousing becomes - mentally and physically! If only more people read Fitts!<p>In my journey, this has involved everything from Microsoft and IBM&#x27;s early joint venture work around CUA in OS&#x2F;2, MAYA Design&#x27;s introduction of mouse-manipulating Z-order (zooming) in DEC Workscape (noted by Mary Czerwinski of Microsoft Research... I&#x27;m not certain whether this was before, during, or after Bederson&#x27;s work on Zoomable UI at U Maryland), Synergy&#x27;s liberating the mouse&#x27;s physical computer-monitor confines between Linux, Mac, and Windows twenty years ago, to tmux, tiling windows managers such as hyprland and the combo of sway and the Logitech multi-platform keybaords and mice on which I&#x27;m typing, Oh, I forgot my daily usage of helix. But I digress. The guys who wrote the post-modern computing tongue-in-cheek paper twenty years ago in Canada (IIRC) weren&#x27;t wrong, at least satirically.<p>This has all served the quest to find a spatiality of computing that mirrors and moves at the speed of thought. I&#x27;ve come close, but none of these has really worked in the holistic and integrated way that I&#x27;ve sought. Time will tell whether Brett Victor or the like has a beyond-Englebart-or-Kay moment.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful while remaining cautiously optimistic.<p>Sway and hyprland could certainly benefit from integration with software like synergy, hardware like the logitech devices, or any notion of &quot;beyond Cartesian&quot; at the keyboard. The obvious challenge is scaling usability in light of exploding complexity of the controls, mechatronics of control, and targets of control, both mental and physical - literally the origin story of the mouse itself. In much the same way that AI divides the room, so did the need for metrics that could start with Fitts while crossing the mental and physical chasm from API to GUI to HCI. Sadly, we&#x27;re not there yet.\n\nWas anybody else a little irritated that the &quot;MonkeyUser&quot; comic &quot;FOCUS (2018)&quot; included in the article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monkeyuser.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;focus&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monkeyuser.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;focus&#x2F;</a><p>seems like a pretty blatant copy of the Jason Heeris comic &quot;programmer interrupted (2013)&quot;? \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;winthropdc.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;programmerinterrupted.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;winthropdc.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;programmerint...</a>\n\n  Not really, memes evolve, Jason should take pride that people want to copy his idea with modification.\n\nOne thing not covered by the author under &quot;automate to save mental energy&quot; is that you can save a ton of mental energy by randomizing. Where do I go to get lunch today? Which item on my to-do list to tackle in the next hour? Which podcast episode to listen to during today&#x27;s walk? Letting these decisions (even much more consequential decisions if you are in the mood for it) be settled by chance not only conserves mental energy (by reducing the cognitive load of decision making) but can also be good for mental health (when outcomes are left to chance, you  feel no self-reproach for unfavorable results, and feel only gratitude for favorable ones).<p>I used to carry a dice around with me just for this purpose. Nowadays, just for fun, I first mentally generate a random mapping (e.g. &quot;even number do X, odd number do Y&quot;) then look around my physical surroundings until my eyes land on a number.\n\n  Ah. Great input and an approach I really haven&#x27;t considered! I think this could be great advice for people who struggle with various degrees of decision fatigue.<p>Personally I tend to be quite impulsive and somewhat random &quot;by design&quot;. Some might call it &quot;creative&quot;. In any case, I tend to get energy from uncertainty where others around me prefer more structure. And vice versa, I feel more friction when there are no choices. My personal backlog serves as a counterweight in order to stay on track.\n\n    I have long felt the same way as you. But I do think everyone benefits from structure - I think the difference is in whether we can accept (or tolerate) externally-imposed structure, especially when we disagree with it. If not, the best coping mechanism is to build your own from the inside. If you examine your own sense of spontaneity, you may find some scaffolding you&#x27;ve built up too.\n\n      &gt; I think the difference is in whether we can accept (or tolerate) externally-imposed structure, especially when we disagree with it. If not, the best coping mechanism is to build your own from the inside.<p>Yes. You&#x27;re being more precise than me here. This is spot on. The way I build and manage my own structure is to combat exactly this. For me it&#x27;s a combination of habits and tools evolved over many years, and it will continue to do so.\n\n  Nice to see a fellow randomizer, agree totally with the approach.<p>What reactions do the people around you have when they see you making decisions based on randomness?  When I would whip out my random number generator app for picking my dinner off a menu, about half the time people would get incredulous or weirdly defensive. Curious if you have come across similar attitudes.\n\n    Good question. Come to think of it, when I randomize I&#x27;m almost always alone by myself. If I&#x27;m having dinner with a companion, I either try to decide on something quickly, or opt for some alternative way of taking the matter out of my hands: e.g. ask that companion (who is always someone more knowledgeable about food than I am) or the server to recommend a dish. For me the main purpose of randomizing is to take certain kinds of matters out of my hands (rather than say to maximize breadth of coverage), and an opinionated friend serves that purpose just as well as a dice, I guess!\n\n<i>&gt;Once vim motions are internalized it’s amazing how efficient it feels to “delete all word” (daw) or “change in paragraph” (cip) without breaking a sweat.

      "conversation_text": "It&#x27;s too bad the top-rated answer on Reddit says &quot;GR does not say Gravity is not a force (or if you do say it’s not a force, then none of the other forces are forces either)&quot; rather than explaining what people mean when they say gravity is not a force (basically, it affects the geometry of spacetime in such a way that an unaccelerated particle can still move along a path that&#x27;s not a straight line in the traditional sense) and why nonetheless we can treat gravity approximately (that is, perturbatively) as if it <i>were</i> a force, and why this perturbative description when quantized predicts a spin-2 boson, the graviton.   Oh well.\n\n  Help me with the last bit, where the perturbations when quantised predict spin-2 bosons.\n\n    Honestly, the flagged&#x2F;dead answer from ChatGPT makes a lot of sense to me.  Can someone explain where it goes wrong, without resorting to the usual snide remarks about parrots and other whistling-past-the-graveyard rhetoric?<p>Is it just making up BS regarding the attributes imparted by various spin values, or is that a reasonable explanation of why gravitons are presumed to be spin-2 particles?\n\n      Indeed. I shared what I thought was a detailed and helpful generative response to further the discussion and hopefully receive feedback from those knowledgeable on the topic. It&#x27;s disappointing to see it met with downvotes and flagging, rather than constructive conversation.\n\n        Same old story throughout history.  People feel threatened by technology, and they lash out.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing <i>here</i>, for sure.\n\n  I recognize your name and believe you know what you are talking about, so please, please tell us the why! You or someone you know probable has a blog post or article you can link, maybe?\n\n    Wow I never look at usernames but maybe I should start.\nI believe I read his `Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity` back in college (or tried to, anyways. it was a touch above my level at the time)\n\n  I had a prof explain it using basic analogy.  Forces are things that can move other things.  An electrical field can move a metal ball.  So too can a metal bat. put a g-meter on the ball and it will register acceleration as force is applied to the ball.  Gravity is different.  Put a g-meter on a falling metal ball and it will detect zero acceleration.  No force is acting upon a ball.  Put that metal ball in an eccentric orbit around the earth and it will speed up and slow down during each orbit, but the g-meter will register zero acceleration. The ball falls but is no not accelerated. So gravity is not a force because it doesn&#x27;t move things.  Gravity is something different.\n\n    But the acceleration meter won&#x27;t measure any force because gravity is acting on every part of it uniformly.  If you had an acceleration meter entirely made out of the same magnetic substance, and you brought a magnet near it, would the acceleration meter register anything, or would it read zero acceleration, since all parts of it were being acted on uniformly (and thus didn&#x27;t &quot;notice&quot; any acceleration)?\n\n      (Replying to myself)<p>I guess one answer to this is that particles which are (supposedly?) massless, like the photon, are affected by the space-time warping effects of gravity.  A parallel construction wouldn&#x27;t be true of magnetism or an electric field.  Furthermore, when we detect gravity waves, they come at the same time as corresponding gamma ray bursts; since the gamma rays are affected by the space-time warping effects of gravity, this means that <i>the gravity waves themselves</i> are affected by the space-time warping effects of gravity.<p>So gravity probably is something else.  But who knows!\n\n        That could also be explained by light having momentum which is affected by (but does not generate) the force of gravity acts like mass.\n\n      <i>&gt; the acceleration meter won&#x27;t measure any force because gravity is acting on every part of it uniformly</i><p>No. The acceleration meter won&#x27;t measure anything because <i>there is nothing to measure</i>. An object in free fall is in free fall; there is no &quot;gravity&quot; acting on it at all. It&#x27;s just as if the object were floating out in deep space, far from all gravitating bodies. That&#x27;s the point of the equivalence principle.<p><i>&gt; If you had an acceleration meter entirely made out of the same magnetic substance, and you brought a magnet near it, would the acceleration meter register anything</i><p>Yes. Electromagnetism, weak, and strong interactions all make the acceleration meter register nonzero, even if the act &quot;equally&quot; on all parts of an object.\n\n        In other words, there is no gravity field, in the way there is an EM field that propagates these forces. Or, the &quot;gravity field&quot; is the fabric of space-time itself\n\n          Yes.\n\n        &gt; The acceleration meter won&#x27;t measure anything because there is nothing to measure.<p>Put this way, isn&#x27;t it almost begging the question? In GR the definition of acceleration is movement in contrast with the movement of gravity. If course gravity will never meet this criteria - all movement due to gravity will be aligned with movement due to gravity.<p>If instead we had a universe where instead of all matter having a gravitational effect, it was that all matter had a magnetic effect the we&#x27;d see no acceleration due to the magnetic effect and gravity would &quot;produce a field&quot; and cause acceleration in your above examples.<p>You can&#x27;t use a gravitational biased tool to proclaim gravity is a neutral actor and everything else is a field.<p>It seems like more accurately, everything is &quot;gravitationally charged&quot;, so instead we say it warps spacetime, but really is no different.\n\n          <i>&gt; Put this way, isn&#x27;t it almost begging the question? In GR the definition of acceleration is movement in contrast with the movement of gravity. </i><p>No, it isn&#x27;t. You have it backwards. The <i>definition</i> of acceleration in GR is proper acceleration, i.e., what an accelerometer reads. The &quot;movement&quot; property is then a <i>consequence</i> of this plus picking an appropriate frame of reference.<p><i>&gt; If instead we had a universe where instead of all matter having a gravitational effect, it was that all matter had a magnetic effect the we&#x27;d see no acceleration due to the magnetic effect</i><p>Yes, you would, because unlike gravity, magnetism does not obey the equivalence principle, so differently charged objects in the same magnetic field with the same initial conditions can have different motions. With gravity, <i>all</i> objects in the same field with the same initial conditions have the same motion, regardless of their mass. That is <i>why</i> it is possible to model gravity using spacetime curvature, and that property is unique to gravity.\n\n            I&#x27;m sure you are familiar with Kalusa-Klein theory (knowing that it is incomplete and&#x2F;or doesn&#x27;t describe our universe), don&#x27;t you think that motion in that theory is less bound to gravity alone like the parent comment suggests because the notion of proper time is different?<p>I tend to gravitate toward the same line of thinking because of the existence of black hole charge limit.\n\n          You might be interested in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory</a>\n\n        &gt; Yes. Electromagnetism, weak, and strong interactions all make the acceleration meter register nonzero, even if the act &quot;equally&quot; on all parts of an object.<p>I’m genuinely curious how that acceleration meter would work. There won’t be any internal forces as a consequence of the external field and no relative motion.\n\n          <i>&gt; I’m genuinely curious how that acceleration meter would work.</i><p>Look up how the one in your phone works. It reads nonzero when you are standing on Earth because of electromagnetic repulsion between your atoms and the atoms in the floor.<p><i>&gt; There won’t be any internal forces</i><p>Yes, there will, because the object&#x27;s internal state (including its shape, size, and internal stresses) when it is accelerated is <i>different</i> from its shape when it is in free fall. Why? Because the acceleration sets up internal forces in the object that result in a different equilibrium from the one it was in while it was freely falling.\n\n            &gt; It reads nonzero when you are standing on Earth because of electromagnetic repulsion between your atoms and the atoms in the floor.<p>It works because there&#x27;s an external force pushing on the surface of the phone, and not equally on all its parts, which is the scenario we are discussing.<p>&gt; Because the acceleration sets up internal forces in the object that result in a different equilibrium from the one it was in while it was freely falling.<p>And the cause of this is what you fail to explain.\n\n              I think the burden of explanation is on the great great grandparent post which proposed an accelerometer &quot;entirely made out of the same magnetic field&quot; which would let it satisfy an equivalence principle for &quot;magnetic force&quot;.\n\n              <i>&gt; It works because there&#x27;s an external force pushing on the surface of the phone</i><p>Which then gets <i>transmitted</i> by the surface of the phone to the rest of the phone.<p><i>&gt; not equally on all its parts</i><p>Yes, equally on all its parts, once you take into account that the parts of the phone can exert forces on each other.<p><i>&gt; the cause of this is what you fail to explain</i><p>Cause of what? The internal forces? That&#x27;s obvious: the <i>distances</i> between adjacent atoms change, and the electromagnetic forces between adjacent atoms are distance dependent. In other words, as I have already pointed out, the <i>size and shape</i> of the object <i>changes</i> when it is accelerated (in the sense of proper acceleration), compared to when it is not. Or, to put it another way, the equilibrium state of the object is <i>different</i> when it is accelerated than when it is not, with different inter-atomic distances and therefore different internal forces (as in, nonzero internal forces when accelerated, compared to zero when not).\n\n                &gt; Which then gets transmitted by the surface of the phone to the rest of the phone.<p>But this is a very different situation than when you have an external force acting equally on all the atoms equally, and you will, as you correctly point out, have forces between the atoms. Of course in this case it is trivial, because you can easily measure the tension between different parts (for example).<p>But that is not the situation we are discussing. The situation we are discussing is when were are an external force on all parts equally. So there will be no tension that you can measure.\n\n                  <i>&gt; this is a very different situation than when you have an external force acting equally on all the atoms</i><p>Gravity is <i>not</i> an &quot;external force&quot; in GR. In GR, an object moving solely under gravity, i.e., in free fall, feels no force (no internal stresses, zero reading on an accelerometer) because there is no force--not because there is &quot;an external force acting equally on all the atoms&quot;.<p>If you want to say that the Newtonian interpretation, where gravity is &quot;an external force acting equally on all the atoms&quot;, is indistinguishable experimentally from the GR interpretation, where gravity isn&#x27;t a force at all, I suppose that&#x27;s true. But then the &quot;external force acting equally on all the atoms&quot; is just like Carl Sagan&#x27;s undetectable dragon in his garage. We have a model that works just as well without it, so it gets scraped right off by Occam&#x27;s Razor. That is the GR position.<p>Also, no matter how you want to resolve the above issue, it still remains true that non-gravitational forces do not obey the equivalence principle, so there is <i>no</i> &quot;spacetime geometry&quot; interpretation for them that works. And those are also the cases where you <i>do</i> have internal stresses in the objects and an accelerometer reads nonzero. So again GR&#x27;s interpretation--that these cases <i>are</i> forces while gravity is not, and that explains the difference in accelerometer readings--is simpler than the Newtonian one, where you have to argue that gravity is a &quot;force&quot; but doesn&#x27;t work like other &quot;forces&quot; work.\n\n                  Put more briefly, gravity does not produce a compressive stress in the phone in free fall. The external force from the table applied to the phone sitting atop it does create compressive stress. Ergo, the situations are fundamentally different.\n\n        &gt; Electromagnetism, weak, and strong interactions all make the acceleration meter register nonzero, even if the act &quot;equally&quot; on all parts of an object.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to wrap my head around this assertion. If all parts of the object are acted upon &quot;equally&quot; (why is this in quotes?) where would this acceleration come from?\n\n          <i>&gt; If all parts of the object are acted upon &quot;equally&quot; (why is this in quotes?) where would this acceleration come from?</i><p>It is proper acceleration, not coordinate acceleration. An object can have nonzero proper acceleration even if none of its parts are in relative motion. Geometrically, proper acceleration corresponds to path curvature of the worldlines of the atoms in the object. &quot;No relative motion&quot; means all the worldlines of the object&#x27;s atoms have the <i>same</i> path curvature (modulo some technicalities that don&#x27;t really matter here). It does <i>not</i> require that that path curvature be zero.<p>Physically, a typical accelerometer works by measuring the internal <i>stresses</i> that are set up in an object when it is accelerated. These stresses put the object into a different equilibrium state than it was in when it was freely falling: the object&#x27;s size and shape can change. For typical solid objects at typical Earthbound accelerations these changes are too small for us to see with our unaided senses--but sensitive instruments like accelerometers can detect them.\n\n            But that path curvature of worldlines is in spacetime, the field of gravity. If you chose your worldline along the electromagnetic field instead, you&#x27;d see no &quot;proper&quot; acceleration when being pulled by the electromagnetic field and you would see &quot;proper&quot; acceleration due to gravity.<p>And to develop internal stresses, there needs to be some difference in the forces acting upon different parts of the body. Again, you are arbitrarily using free fall as your choice of a default state, against which you are comparing. If you instead chose being stationary on the ground, which would correspond to when you are in electromagnetic free fall, you would register an acceleration when in gravitational free fall.\n\n              <i>&gt; that path curvature of worldlines is in spacetime</i><p>It&#x27;s the path curvature of <i>worldlines</i> in spacetime.<p><i>&gt; the field of gravity</i><p>Only if the spacetime is curved. But worldlines can have path curvature even in flat spacetime.<p><i>&gt; If you chose your worldline along the electromagnetic field instead, you&#x27;d see no &quot;proper&quot; acceleration when being pulled by the electromagnetic field and you would see &quot;proper&quot; acceleration due to gravity.</i><p>There is no such thing as &quot;worldline along the electromagnetic field&quot; as you appear to be using the term. A charged object in an electromagnetic field will have nonzero proper acceleration, as measured by an accelerometer. That&#x27;s an invariant prediction; there is no alternate model in which it&#x27;s any different.<p><i>&gt; to develop internal stresses, there needs to be some difference in the forces acting upon different parts of the body</i><p>No, there doesn&#x27;t. There just needs to be a difference in the shape and size of the body, from its state when under no external forces.<p>It is true that, if the body is large enough, the distribution of <i>internal</i> stresses in the body might not be uniform when the body reaches its equilibrium state under some externally applied force. For example, if the object is tall enough, the internal pressure at the top will be measurably less than the internal pressure at the bottom. But this is not due to any difference in <i>external</i> force being applied to the object. It&#x27;s due to how the object adjusts itself to be in equilibrium under the applied external force.<p><i>&gt; If you instead chose being stationary on the ground, which would correspond to when you are in electromagnetic free fall, you would register an acceleration when in gravitational free fall.</i><p>Again, this is just wrong. There is neither a valid theoretical model, nor any experimental data, to support this claim.\n\n                You are grossly misunderstanding what I am saying, and I don&#x27;t know how better to explain it.\n\n                  As far as I can tell, you are claiming that there is a viable model in which, for example, a charged object moving in an electromagnetic field would have &quot;zero proper acceleration&quot; while an uncharged object moving solely under gravity, would have &quot;nonzero proper acceleration&quot;. But such a model can&#x27;t be right, because &quot;proper acceleration&quot; is a direct observable, and our direct observation is the other way around.\n\n                    It is so difficult to remotely understand all this when every other term is in &quot;quotes&quot;. Of course, I&#x27;m not a physicist, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t understand it all, anyways. I am just pointing out how many dang quotes there are. Could you guys maybe define the terms first so you don&#x27;t have to put two fingers around every concept?<p>BTW I made this &quot;comment&quot; by &quot;clicking&quot; on the reply button and then I &quot;typed&quot; it using my &quot;keyboard&quot;. No, I don&#x27;t mean &quot;keyboard&quot; when I say &quot;keyboard&quot;, hence the quotes.\n\n                Inertia causes the sensor in the accelerometer to read nonzero.<p>Meta: let&#x27;s stop arguing what might happen, and do the experiment!\n\n                  <i>&gt; Inertia causes the sensor in the accelerometer to read nonzero.</i><p>This can&#x27;t be right, because an object moving solely under gravity <i>is</i> moving solely under its own inertia, but an accelerometer attached to it reads zero.<p><i>&gt; do the experiment!</i><p>Do what experiment? Experiments showing that accelerometers attached to objects moving solely under gravity read zero, while objects subjected to non-gravitational forces read nonzero, have been done.\n\n      Yeah, if every part of human body is accelerated equally, there&#x27;s no way to feel anything (you could see it). No matter how hard you get hit or thrown around, you can&#x27;t measure it internally. Each cell can only feel their neighbors, and there&#x27;s no internal stress &#x2F; force between cells.\n\n        This isn’t true. Try jumping off a building and you’ll find the acceleration to be quite noticeable ;)\n\n          Only because you feel the air rushing past, and the impact with the ground.<p>If you do this in a capsule where the air is moving with you, and avoid hitting the ground, we call the sensation &quot;weightlessness&quot; or &quot;zero g&quot;, like is experienced by astronauts in orbit.<p>Gravity is absolutely acting on astronauts orbiting the earth, at nearly the same strength as if they were standing on the ground. Depending on the shape of the orbit their linear speed may be increasing or decreasing, and they are definitely experiencing directional acceleration as their path bends in a circle around the Earth. But internally there is no bodily sensation of acceleration. It feels the same as floating, or free fall without the air rushing past.\n\n            Yes but the feeling of weightlessness is something you can distinguish!\n\n              But you don&#x27;t feel the force of acceleration. Floating weightless and motionless in space feels the same as being in an elliptical orbit around a planet.\n\n                Even more, accelerating due to a being in an (idealized) rocket <i>also</i> feels the same.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npl.washington.edu&#x2F;eotwash&#x2F;equivalence-principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npl.washington.edu&#x2F;eotwash&#x2F;equivalence-principle</a><p>This has to be true, because if you can&#x27;t (internally) detect the difference between nothing and a planet being nearby, you obviously also can&#x27;t detect how massive the planet is, so you can&#x27;t know if your acceleration relative to the nearby environment is due to gravity or something else, or even how much &quot;absolutel&quot; acceleration you have.<p>Standing on earth (or the floor of your rocket) feels different due to electromagnetic effects of the nearby &quot;touching&quot; external objects.\n\n            I did sky diving some years back. I did feel acceleration immediately after the jump for a second, but then afterwards it was as if I was lying on bed. So what was that feeling I experienced (it was similar to maintain giant wheel coming down)\n\n              Going from standing on a surface where you are resisting the force of gravity (like standing on the ground, or in a stable aircraft) to being in free fall definitely has a sensation.<p>It&#x27;s a sensation that actually causes a decent percentage of people to feel physically ill for a period after launching to orbit on a rocket.<p>It&#x27;s like going over the top of a hill on a roller coaster where you go from being pulled down into your seat to floating up against the restraints.<p>But once you&#x27;re falling, or or in orbit (which is also free fall just outside an atmosphere), you don&#x27;t feel the changes in velocity (acceleration) due to gravity.\n\n          The point is you won&#x27;t feel it (aside from air resistance) on the way down.\n\n            The air too, you only feel because the ground and other air is pushing it upwards\n\n          If the impact somehow could stop your all cells at the same rate, you wouldn&#x27;t feel it. Your body gets compressed because of different rates of acceleration.<p>If aliens have tech which can apply this type of force field &#x2F; acceleration, then they won&#x27;t get squished in their spaceships no matter how hard they accelerate. You basically need a large force field like gravity, instead of transferring force via small intermolecular force fields.\n\n    This is a clever analogy, but it&#x27;s actually a little specious.<p>The reason the &quot;g-meter&quot; (e.g. a weight on a scale) doesn&#x27;t move in the gravity case is that the weight is affected by the same field.  The weight is a weight and feels gravity just like you and everything else in your environment does.<p>But by construction, you&#x27;re imagining that the scale you have holds a different electrical charge than the object to which it&#x27;s attached.  Which is &quot;normal&quot; according to our everyday experience, but just an artifact of the way charges work on large objects (they distribute themselves on the &quot;outside&quot; of a conductive environment and everything inside tends to have a neutral distribution).<p>But that&#x27;s just arbitrary.  You could equally demand (in your gedankenexperiment, though doing this in practice would be very difficult) that your electrical charge be distributed just like the mass is, in which case the force measured would be zero too.\n\n      As an aside there are real gravimeters that aren’t scales and they are sensitive enough to detect a person walking around the room they are in and snow accumulating on that building’s roof. Yes that’s right they detect the gravitational force exerted by the snow’s mass.\n\n        <i>&gt; Yes that’s right they detect the gravitational force exerted by the snow’s mass.</i><p>No, they don&#x27;t. Gravimeters of the type you describe measure the coordinate acceleration of a freely falling test object in the accelerated frame of the gravimeter. In other words, it&#x27;s the <i>gravimeter</i> (the part that isn&#x27;t the freely falling test object) that has a force acting on it, which makes it accelerate upward (proper acceleration--an accelerometer attached to the gravimeter reads nonzero), and a freely falling test mass therefore appears to accelerate downward (coordinate acceleration in the frame of the gravimeter), just as if the gravimeter were inside an accelerating rocket out in deep space far from all gravitating bodies.<p>In other words, gravimeters of this type rely on the equivalence principle, which is the same principle that GR uses to justify the statement that gravity is <i>not</i> a force.\n\n        Rather more pertinently to the question &quot;why is gravity different?&quot;, we can measure the <i>time dilation</i> caused by a gravitational potential change of less than 1cm near the surface of the Earth: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicsworld.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gravitational-time-dilation-measured-on-centimetre-and-millimetre-scales-in-atomic-clocks&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicsworld.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gravitational-time-dilation-measu...</a>\n\n    &gt; put a g-meter on the ball and it will register acceleration as force is applied to the ball. Gravity is different. Put a g-meter on a falling metal ball and it will detect zero acceleration<p>Put an electrical field generator on a falling metal ball and it will detect changing electric field though...\n\n      Well, a changing electric field is not a force tho.\n\n    Gravity in GR is a &#x27;fictitious force&#x27; or an apparent force, meaning it is is an artifact of your chosen frame of reference.<p>A feather falling the same speed as an elephant in the Earth reference frame is an example.<p>It is the same as other apperant forces like centrifugal force.<p>Even Newton himself said &#x27;Hypotheses non fingo,&#x27; or &#x27;I feign no hypotheses. &#x27;<p>It was a conjecture.\n\n    &gt; So too can a metal bat. put a g-meter on the ball and it will register acceleration as force is applied to the ball. Gravity is different. Put a g-meter on a falling metal ball and it will detect zero acceleration.<p>That really depends on construction of your g-meter. If instead of mass (ie. gravitational charge) you use electric charge in your accelerometer then that electric charge on the falling ball - ie. moving with acceleration - will generate EM wave thus providing clear detection of acceleration.<p>Wrt. the &quot;boson&quot; - gravity effects propagate with finite speed, i.e. wave, and the neutron in gravitational potential experiment shows that the gravitational potential&#x2F;energy is quantized, and thus we have wave and quantized nature -&gt; boson (wave packet&#x2F;quant mediating interaction of a charge with the field).\n\n      Your charge-based g-meter would also measure zero acceleration in free fall.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_radiation_of_charged_particles_in_a_gravitational_field\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_radiation_of_charge...</a>\n\n        &gt; the radiation goes into a region of spacetime inaccessible to the co-accelerating, supported observer. In effect, a uniformly accelerated observer has an event horizon, and there are regions of spacetime inaccessible to this observer<p>Curious interpretation, but beware this bit wasn&#x27;t substantiated that well.\n\n    Yeah this never made sense to me. Yes, it detects no acceleration. Great. But we know it IS accelerating; if you fall your speed will increase, this can only occur if you are accelerating?!\n\n      How would you measure this alleged speed increase, <i>internally</i>?<p>You can&#x27;t.\n\n        I sure can’t. But why would I want to measure speed increase internally, when it’s due to an external field?<p>Quick question, how would I even measure speed itself internally? I thought motion and speed was always measured relative to something else, why would an increase of these properties then have to be internal?<p>Not trying to be a dick, I’m genuinely curious. And yes, I obviously do not know anything about physics. Any explanation or link to a source to help me understand?\n\n  I&#x27;ve recently learned about Kaluza–Klein theories (just curious wiki browsing), do they unify electromagnetism and gravity in the sense that electromagnetism also &quot;works by changing the geometry of spacetime&quot; ? How does this relate to QFT?\n\n    &gt; do they unify electromagnetism and gravity in the sense that electromagnetism also &quot;works by changing the geometry of spacetime&quot; ?<p>Yes, somehow actually. KK theories introduce an extra spatial dimension beyond our usual (3+1) which is postulated to be &quot;compactified&quot;. This just means that it&#x27;s curled up on itself at such a tiny scale that we don&#x27;t directly perceive it. The way this extra dimension is curled and shaped affects the geometry of the overall 5-D spacetime. How it is connected to EM is that now these geometrical variations in the 5-D spacetime, when viewed from our 4-D perspective, manifest as the EM force and its associated field.<p>So you can say like in GR which have gravity arises as consequence of geometry, it is in KK that EM is consequence of geometry. However, the geometry and details are different.<p>&gt; How does this relate to QFT?<p>Not much in the sense that they can provide useful information to each other. QFT describes forces in terms of interactions mediated by particles (e.g., photons for EM). KK, while primarily geometrical, give hints that perhaps these force-carrying particles can be associated with specific vibrational modes of the extra dimension. Of course KK theory only include EM and gravity. So we know for sure that we need to go beyond KK. This was the actual motivation for people to think about string theory to expand the original KK work.\n\n      &gt; KK theories introduce an extra spatial dimension beyond our usual (3+1) which is postulated to be &quot;compactified&quot;. This just means that it&#x27;s curled up on itself<p>You&#x27;ve just explained &quot;compactified&quot; in terms of being &quot;curled up&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t really help (for me, at least). What does it mean for a dimension to be &quot;curled up&quot;?\n\n        I&#x27;m sorry if I&#x27;m confusing. That&#x27;s the term I use, usually assuming that it is obvious (like referring to C++ templates to a python developer without explaining what is that).<p>To be honest, it is hard to visualize, as it is counterintuitive of what we think of space. While I know many people would disagree, I really like the garden hose analogy [1]. The idea is to simply imagine a very long garden hose. From a great distance, it looks like a one-dimensional line. Now you get closer, and realize it has a second dimension, which is its circumference curled around that seemingly 1-D line. An ant walking on the hose can move along its length, but also in a circle around it. The extra dimension in KK is like this circumference. It is tiny, curled up so we don&#x27;t directly notice it, but still potentially there.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2004&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;extra-dimensions&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preposterousuniverse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2004&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;extra-d...</a>\n\n          This kind of makes me think of a spatial version of the Time Cube.\n\n      Interesting. I ask because I have a suspicion that Quantum theories seem more fundamental than General relativity, because treating geometry within a quantum framework seems very hard and &quot;non-natural&quot;, or implausible (e.g. when considering superposition of spacetimes!). While if somehow gravity is a quantum effect (within a simpler space-time framework), that seems much more plausible... but Kaluza-Klein captured my interest in the other direction. Although I&#x27;m still thinking the quantum framework is appears to be the correct one, even though the assumptions of GR are very strong (so something like the equivalence principle or some other notable principle needs to break).\n\n      The problem with extra dimensions is that such an increase of dimensions preclude pairwise interaction of particles due to lacking a sound relationship between 2-operand dot product, cross product and 2-operand tensor product in those dimensions.\n\n  What does it mean to &#x27;treat gravity approximately (that is, perturbatively)&#x27;?  That sounds like something we do to model, which only approximates reality.  That model sounds like it shouldn&#x27;t be used to predict anything else? Or at least whatever is predicted shouldn&#x27;t be expected to exist in &#x27;reality&#x27;.\n\n    It’s models all the way down.\n\n    John von Neumann: &quot;... the sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work—that is, correctly to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area.&quot;<p>Both GR and QFT are insanely accurate models, but they are just models.<p>The N-body problem is undecidable, and Gödel, Turing, Church and other s proved that is the best we can do.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philsci-archive.pitt.edu&#x2F;13175&#x2F;1&#x2F;parker2003.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philsci-archive.pitt.edu&#x2F;13175&#x2F;1&#x2F;parker2003.pdf</a><p>Western reductionism or Laplacian determinism is a good framework for practical, computable models. QFT actually is actually one of the counterexamples to Western reductionism.<p>But models are reductive and scientific models are just models. Don&#x27;t confuse the map for the territory.<p>All models are wrong, some are useful; is another way of saying the same thing.\n\n      Could you elaborate or share some articles on why QFT is a counterexample to western reductionism ? In laymans terms that is.\n\n        The oversimplified version is Laplac&#x27;s deamon can&#x27;t split quantum superposition.<p>Superposition being inseparable is a large part on why the many words concept is popular with some people.  It is about regaining a form of determinism.\n\n    There isn&#x27;t a model out there that doesn&#x27;t break down at some point.<p>Looking at gravity, we can compare what General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics say about the center of a black hole. Remember, both GR and QM have both been able to accurately model the way the world works at every scale we have been able to measure and test them. But they are incompatible with each other in certain points, such as the singularity in the black hole. GR says the center of the black hole is an infinitely dense point. QM says this can&#x27;t be true because everything is made up of waves in a field, which requires things be spread out over some amount of an area. These can&#x27;t both be true, yet GR and QM have both stood up to every single test and observation we can throw at them. Every prediction they make that we can verify has been verified and lines up with the theories. And this is not the only place they disagree, of course, but it is one example.<p>And that&#x27;s really, from my understanding, the more fundamental answer to the question asked in the reddit post. It&#x27;s not that unifying the two requires a gauge boson like the graviton, though that it is one possible outcome when quantizing gravity, but that we have two very useful and very tested models of how things work that are incompatible with each other in certain ways. Maybe gravitons exist, though it currently seems impossible for us to reach the point where we can detect them - Dyson calculated that using an Earth sized detector we&#x27;d be able to detect about one graviton from the sun per billion years, if they exist - and maybe they don&#x27;t.<p>As for predicted things not expecting to exist in reality, this is really just par for the course for models. It&#x27;s not like tensors are some real physical thing either, for example.\n\n    Unaccelerated particle= inertial frame.<p>Approximately: consider gravity as small deviations from inertiality, so it&#x27;s approximately linear, like the other forces we know and love.\n\n    Q. What&#x27;s the difference between a boson and a bison?<p>A. When you incessantly hunt for every boson you can find anywhere, you end up with more of them.\n\n  I think that more generally the answer is not responsive to the actual question, which is: why do GR and QM need to be unified? To be fair, the question itself wrongly conflates &quot;gravity needs a gauge boson&quot; with the question about GR and QM being unified. Not all theories of quantum gravity involve a &quot;gauge boson&quot; for gravity along the lines of the other Standard Model interactions.<p>Nor does the basic rationale for <i>why</i> we think gravity needs to be quantized involve a &quot;gauge boson&quot;. It involves simple reasoning about how QM works. Say we have an experiment which puts an object with non-negligible stress-energy into a superposition of being in two different positions (for example, we make its position depend on the outcome of a spin measurement on a qubit). QM would say that spacetime would then need to also be in a superposition of two different geometries. But GR, as a classical theory, has no way to handle that. We would need a quantum theory of gravity, i.e., a quantum theory that can handle superpositions of different spacetime geometries.\n\n    &gt;Say we have an experiment which puts an object with non-negligible stress-energy into a superposition of being in two different positions (for example, we make its position depend on the outcome of a spin measurement on a qubit). QM would say that spacetime would then need to also be in a superposition of two different geometries.<p>The energy to move the object into a given position is an additional element here unaccounted for in your model. 2 different positions to move object into - 2 different energies (more specifically 2 different changes to the starting, before the experiment, stress energy distribution of the Universe). When corresponding moving energies (ie. their GR effects) are accounted for in those 2 cases it may as well be that those 2 cases are indistinguishable from the GR point of view, ie. those 2 supposedly different spacetime geometries happen to be the same. The superposition of 2 indistinguishable cases - it doesn&#x27;t really matter is it superposition or not.\n\n      There is an entire sub-field of experimental science that involves putting ever larger objects in superpositions of different locations. These experiments are no closer to testing quantum gravity, but they falsify whatever it is you&#x27;re trying to say here. See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep13884\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep13884</a> for a random example.\n\n      <i>&gt; The energy to move the object into a given position is an additional element here unaccounted for in your model.</i><p>You can set the experiment up so the energy is the same in both cases (for example, both positions at the same height, just horizontally separated). If you don&#x27;t, then yes, you have to include the effects of the different energies in your model.<p><i>&gt; When corresponding moving energies (ie. their GR effects) are accounted for in those 2 cases it may as well be that those 2 cases are indistinguishable from the GR point of view, ie. those 2 supposedly different spacetime geometries happen to be the same.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how this would work if the energies were different, since &quot;different&quot; <i>means</i> a different source for the spacetime geometry.<p>But in any case, yes, for such an experiment to be relevant at all to the question I was discussing, the spacetime geometries being superposed would have to be different.\n\n        &gt;You can set the experiment up so the energy is the same in both cases (for example, both positions at the same height, just horizontally separated)<p>The action of placing them, say with your hands for simplicity, into different horizontal positions means differently pushing the Earth with your legs. For more cleaner illustration - let&#x27;s say in our experiment a space ship is placed into orbit clockwise or anti clockwise. We can&#x27;t just teleport the ship, so let&#x27;s say we move it by rocket engines. So the ship goes in one direction, rocket engine exhaust goes in the other. The exhaust does have mass and speed. Even if it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate the superposition gap, it will definitely decrease it, and decreasing the superposition gap increases the chances that some other unaccounted for factor(s) (for example gravitational waves caused by all these movements) will eliminate it or decrease further. Even if ultimately we still can&#x27;t fully eliminate the gap, significantly decreasing it may eliminate various divergencies arising from quantization or make them very smallscale&#x2F;localized (an observer from Alfa Centauri wouldn&#x27;t care about the ship&#x27;s orbit direction like we don&#x27;t care about the spin of a given particle in the air around us) and average-able out on larger scales.\n\n          <i>&gt; The action of placing them, say with your hands for simplicity, into different horizontal positions means differently pushing the Earth with your legs.</i><p>This might change the <i>momentum</i>, but not the energy if the heights are the same. But if your point is that there will always be <i>some</i> difference in a conserved quantity, yes, that&#x27;s a fair point.<p>But it also means that there will always be <i>some</i> difference in the spacetime geometry. None of the other factors you talk about would eliminate the &quot;superposition gap&quot;, because none of them cancel out any changes in the spacetime geometry; they just add <i>more</i> changes to it.<p><i>&gt; average-able out on larger scales</i><p>But if you don&#x27;t have a theory that can represent the variations you&#x27;re going to average out, you can&#x27;t do the averaging. That&#x27;s the problem: classical GR cannot represent &quot;variation in spacetime geometry&quot; at all. It can only represent <i>one</i> spacetime geometry. It can&#x27;t represent a superposition of them, not even to do an average.\n\n    I would imagine the desire to unify GR and QM is because if we expect the universe to operate on a set of rules, they <i>should</i> by unified. And we just need to find out <i>how</i>.<p>But the forces and factors that work on the smallest particle should be the same forces that work on the largest of galaxies. If they are not, that&#x27;s a completely different mystery and means our entire view of the universe is missing something substantial.\n\n      <i>&gt; I would imagine the desire to unify GR and QM is because if we expect the universe to operate on a set of rules, they should by unified.</i><p>That is one key principle that drives the effort, yes. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean things will always work out that way. Freeman Dyson, for one, published at least one paper making arguments for why gravity didn&#x27;t need to be quantized.<p><i>&gt; the forces and factors that work on the smallest particle should be the same forces that work on the largest of galaxies.</i><p>If you mean <i>fundamental</i> forces, then this is true (that&#x27;s the definition of &quot;fundamental&quot;), but it also means that you have to adopt many levels of indirection between those fundamental forces and what actually happens with macroscopic objects. Or, to put it another way, the models we actually use to make predictions can have &quot;forces and factors&quot; in them that are <i>not</i> any of the fundamental ones, and that&#x27;s fine, as long as we have some chain of reasoning that connects those models to the fundamental forces and factors. For example, our models of macroscopic objects can have dissipative forces like friction and viscosity in them; those aren&#x27;t fundamental forces. But we have a chain of reasoning that connects them to fundamental forces (electromagnetic forces between electrons in atoms).\n\n    My layperson understanding is that GR specifies that energy&#x2F;mass-momemtum influences space-time curvature which then produces gravity (as particles travelling along straight lines in the curved space). That would imply that fermions are therefore the force carriers for gravity, not a hypothetical new boson.\n\n      Well, bosons also have mass and can distort space.  Theoretically even the (rest-)massless photon distorts spacetime, think it&#x27;s called a kugelblitz.  Also how would fermions be the force carriers if they don&#x27;t physically move through space themselves to interact with far away fermions, ex gravitational waves?  Unless you&#x27;re advocating for a relational model of space which hey I&#x27;m all for but introduces other issues afaik\n\n      <i>&gt; My layperson understanding is that GR specifies that energy&#x2F;mass-momemtum influences space-time curvature which then produces gravity (as particles travelling along straight lines in the curved space).</i><p>That&#x27;s correct. However...<p><i>&gt; That would imply that fermions are therefore the force carriers for gravity, not a hypothetical new boson.</i><p>That&#x27;s wrong. Energy&#x2F;mass-momentum (which can, as hughesjj points out, be bosons or fermions or both) is the <i>source</i> of gravity. The source is not the same as the &quot;force carrier&quot;. (For example, in electromagnetism the source is charge&#x2F;current, but the force carrier is the photon.)<p>In GR, gravity has no &quot;force carrier&quot; because it is not a force. In the simplest quantum model that has a &quot;force carrier&quot; for gravity, the quantum field theory of a massless spin-2 field, the &quot;force carrier&quot; is the massless spin-2 graviton, which is not the same as any source that occurs in ordinary matter.\n\n  it would be so much easier to visualize it if we could imagine 4th dimension.\n\n  You can say similar things about the field of the other forces too, though. The path of a charged particle in the EM field could be described as that particle experiencing a different space-time geometry, arising from the EM and gravitational field combined, and thus EM could also be seen as a geometry and not a force. In fact, the impulse of photons, which are vibrations in the EM field, does affect the curvature of space-time, similar to how particles with mass do.\n\n    <i>&gt; The path of a charged particle in the EM field could be described as that particle experiencing a different space-time geometry</i><p>No, it can&#x27;t, because the EM interaction does not obey the equivalence principle, as gravity does. The geometric interpretation of gravity relies on the equivalence principle.<p>To state this another way: if I put two objects with different masses at a given point in spacetime and give them both the same initial velocity in the same direction, their paths through spacetime under gravity will be the same. But if I put two objects with different charges at a given point in the same electromagnetic field and give them both the same initial velocity in the same direction, their paths through spacetime will <i>not</i> be the same. And this remains true even if I add &quot;extra dimensions&quot; to &quot;spacetime&quot; along the lines of Kaluza-Klein theory, to represent the EM field.\n\n  I feel like it&#x27;s easier to explain that gravity is a force between matter and space(time) and not necessarily between matter and matter, like we presume the other forces are.\n\n  Woaw, a top comment by John Carlos Baez himself!\n\n  Non gravity forces are quite linear and simple, the coupling with fermions is only through covariant derivative.<p>Gravity is extremely non linear, when you look at the expression for Ricci tensor, it is much more complicated than other forces.\n\nI like to think of gravity as displacement of the &quot;ether &quot;.   I suppose negative mass would have a type of repelling effect on mass which I figure is energy of various negative mass.<p>Radio waves are relatively low in negative mass along with photons.\n\n  I didn&#x27;t think there was such a thing as negative mass. That is, you can hypothetically have gravity that is repulsive, but you cannot have negative mass because mass is a property of matter conveyed by the Higgs field. All matter has some positive value for mass; the measure of the matter&#x27;s resistance to acceleration.<p>Photons (a.k.a energy, including radio waves) do not interact with the Higgs field and so have zero mass.<p>There is no negative Higgs field, and no negative mass.<p>There&#x27;s also no ether either as originally constructed (it was ruled out by experiment) but you could be speaking metaphorically.\n\n    So is it really the energy of coupling between particles and Higgs field (along with other kinds of energy and momentum) that reshapes the spacetime?\n\n      I don&#x27;t think I know the math well enough to answer the question definitively, but given my surface understanding of the Standard Model and GR... I think so (though I suspect &quot;energy of coupling&quot; is the wrong way to put it).\n\n      Most mass of massive objects doesn&#x27;t come from the higgs mechanism. It&#x27;s mostly the relativistic mass (?) of binding energy in protons and neutrons. So, I&#x27;m not sure the Higgs field needs to be involved at all.\n\n        Thank you.\n\n    Photons have zero <i>rest</i> mass. But they&#x27;re never at rest, they are <i>always</i> travelling at the speed of light. They have mass equivalent to their energy, which is related to their wavelength.\n\n      I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the accepted view (that photons have mass). <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;profoundphysics.com&#x2F;why-do-photons-have-no-mass-simple-proof&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;profoundphysics.com&#x2F;why-do-photons-have-no-mass-simp...</a><p>When the velocity is the speed of light, solving the equation of special relativity yields <i>m</i> of zero.<p>We have a successful theory of quantum mechanics which integrates with special relativity, so that definition holds, even if you take the same approach from an Effective Field Theory perspective.\n\n        The article you link starts off by defining <i>mass</i> as <i>rest mass</i>. I think the article shows very clearly that photons have no rest mass, using several different arguments.<p>However, a photon has energy, so therefore it must have not-at-rest mass. The article doesn&#x27;t really comment on not-at-rest mass. We know photons interact with gravity because of gravitational lensing.\n\n          The calculation for mass zeros out as <i>c</i> is a divisor. You get zero for one of the coefficients of the mass calculation, which winds up making the whole thing zero.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t have to comment on not-at-rest mass because the math is clear.<p>As for interacting with gravity, photons move through spacetime, and general relativity shows that gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and photons move on the shortest geodesic for that spacetime.\n\n      I&#x27;m not enough of a physicist to explain why this framing is wrong, but I took enough physics in college to know it absolutely is wrong.<p>Fun fact from my &quot;Modern Physics&quot; homework: a system of <i>two</i> photons can have mass, if they&#x27;re traveling in different directions. In parallel though, they&#x27;re still massless.\n\n      Mainstream academic physics has completely eliminated the concept of non-rest, variable mass. Mass and energy are equivalent, so you CAN apply mass values to the kinetic energy of a particle, but it turns out to be more confusing than its worth.<p>To be clear, it&#x27;s just a reformulation of the math involved. Both formulations of GR&#x2F;SR with and without variable mass create the same predictions. It&#x27;s just that it keeps the concept of mass more coherent to stick with &quot;mass is the energy of a particle at rest&quot;.\n\n  Physicists have been down that path along time ago.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_exper...</a>\n\n  &gt; I like to think of gravity as displacement of the &quot;ether &quot;.<p>You are only behind physics community by ~140 years [1]. We know for sure that there is no &quot;ether&quot; so its displacement is not what causes gravity. It was a trial to explain how light would move if it is wave, which we didn&#x27;t know about EM waves then.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_exper...</a>\n\n    From MM experiment, we know for sure that there&#x27;s no ether <i>with the properties that were ascribed to it</i>. However, you can easily come up with a theory of ether that completely matches those observations - it&#x27;s just not as useful as a model because the concept itself becomes kinda redundant at that point. However, this is just as much an issue of terminology. Here&#x27;s Einstein on the subject:<p>&quot;More careful reflection teaches us however, that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether. We may assume the existence of an ether; only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it, i.e. we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz had still left it. We shall see later that this point of view, the conceivability of which I shall at once endeavor to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison, is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity ... according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable.&quot;\n\nI have no background in physics beyond my highschool class, but how I understand gravity is this: matter has inertia, the universe is expanding &quot;up&quot; (into the future, away from the Big Bang) and out (stretching the surface), the inertia of the matter causes a depression in the spacetime, and the normal force of that curved spacetime causes objects to &quot;attract&quot; each other. This also seems to explain the relationship between gravity and the rate at which time passes (time dilation).<p>Is this understanding wrong by generally accepted science?\n\n  <i>&gt; Is this understanding wrong by generally accepted science?</i><p>Yes. It&#x27;s also not relevant to the discussion in this thread. The properties of gravity under discussion here have nothing whatever to do with expansion of the universe.\n\n    &gt; Yes.<p>I was hoping for some elaboration.<p>&gt; The properties of gravity under discussion here have nothing whatever to do with expansion of the universe.<p>At least part of the discussion is about gravity being (caused by? understood as?) the curvature of spacetime.

I&#x27;m asking to hope to understand the subject better.\n\n      <i>&gt; I was hoping for some elaboration.</i><p>If you mean elaboration on how the expansion of the universe works, I can give that, but as I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s irrelevant to this discussion.<p><i>&gt; At least part of the discussion is about gravity being (caused by? understood as?) the curvature of spacetime.</i><p>More precisely, the curvature of spacetime <i>around an isolated gravitating body</i>. Which is a very <i>different</i> spacetime geometry from the spacetime geometry of the universe as a whole, which is what cosmologists use to account for the observations that lead us to say that the universe is expanding.<p><i>&gt; Why would matter curve spacetime, if not for the accelerated expansion of spacetime</i><p>You have it backwards. What you are calling &quot;the accelerated expansion of spacetime&quot; is an <i>effect</i> of spacetime curvature, not a cause of it. Plus, as I said above, that spacetime curvature is the curvature of the universe as a whole, which is very different from the curvature around an isolated gravitating body, that we are discussing here.<p><i>&gt; matter resisting acceleration due to inertia?</i><p>This has <i>nothing</i> to do with spacetime curvature at all. It would be present even if spacetime were flat.\n\n      <i>&gt; I&#x27;m also OOTL on the boson part</i><p>The idea behind that is that, for all other interactions (electromagnetic, weak, strong), our Standard Model of particle physics tells us that there are &quot;gauge bosons&quot; (for electromagnetism it&#x27;s the photon, for weak it&#x27;s the W+, W-, and Z bosons, and for strong it&#x27;s the eight gluons) that mediate the interaction. The full details of how this works involve quantum field theory and are way too long to go into here; all we need for this discussion is the basic idea that any interaction in quantum field theory has one or more &quot;gauge bosons&quot;.<p>So <i>if</i> we are going to try to quantize gravity, the obvious way to do it--at least if you are a Standard Model particle physicist--is to treat it the same way and have a &quot;gauge boson&quot; for it. This has actually been done: the quantum field theory of a massless spin-2 field, which is what a &quot;gauge boson&quot; for gravity would look like, was developed in the 1960s and early 1970s. Furthermore, the classical limit of this quantum field theory is known to be General Relativity, i.e., the classical theory of gravity that we already have and that we already know works. So <i>if</i> we want to treat gravity as if it were a Standard Model interaction and give it a &quot;gauge boson&quot;, this would be one obvious way to do it.<p>The reddit questioner was asking the more basic question of <i>why</i> we would want to do that at all--why do we <i>need</i> to quantize gravity. If we don&#x27;t need to, the fact that we <i>could</i> do it using this known mathematical model (there are other issues that come into play with that, which one of the reddit responses mentions, but leave that aside) is irrelevant. Not all mathematical models have physical realizations.\n\n        Thank you for going deeper. I&#x27;m going to give this a more thorough look and investigate deeper when I have more time in a few hours.\n\n        Probably a dumb question, but... why massless?  If I understand GR correctly, the gravitational field itself (especially in the form of a gravitational wave) has energy, and therefore contributes to the mass-energy tensor, further bending spacetime.  Would that correspond to a gauge particle with mass?\n\n          <i>&gt; why massless?</i><p>Meaning, why is the spin-2 field massless? The easiest short answer is, because gravity is a long range interaction, and only massless gauge bosons can give you a long range interaction. That&#x27;s why electromagnetism is also long range (the photon is massless) but the weak interaction is not (W+, W-, and Z are massive).<p>The strong interaction, unfortunately, breaks this simple heuristic (the gluon is massless but the strong interaction is short range), because it has other factors involved which aren&#x27;t as easy to explain. But we know that those other factors don&#x27;t come into play with the spin-2 field model of gravity, so we can still safely say that the graviton should be massless.<p><i>&gt;  If I understand GR correctly, the gravitational field itself (especially in the form of a gravitational wave) has energy</i><p>Only in a certain sense, which is...<p><i>&gt; and therefore contributes to the mass-energy tensor, further bending spacetime.</i><p>...not this sense. The stress-energy tensor does not contain any &quot;gravity&quot; contribution. In the Einstein Field Equation, &quot;gravity&quot; is on the LHS, represented by the Einstein tensor, and &quot;mass-energy&quot; is on the RHS, represented by the stress-energy tensor. That has to be the case in order for local conservation laws to hold.<p>What all that means is that there is no valid <i>local</i> concept of &quot;energy stored in the gravitational field&quot; (because there is no tensor quantity that corresponds to this). But <i>globally</i>, you can still look at a system that emits gravitational waves and come up with a meaningful concept of &quot;total energy&quot; that decreases with time as gravitational waves are emitted. (This concept is called the &quot;Bondi energy&quot;.) So we <i>can</i> say that &quot;gravitational waves carry energy&quot; in this sense. We just can&#x27;t <i>localize</i> where that energy is.\n\n            That&#x27;s a very good explanation.  Thank you.<p>One of the things I love about HN:  You don&#x27;t just get &quot;you&#x27;re stupid not to know that&quot; (though you sometimes get that too).  You also get real explanations from people that actually know things and take the time to explain it well.\n\n              <i>&gt; Thank you.</i><p>You&#x27;re welcome! Thanks for the kudos.\n\n      You lead with saying you have no background in physics, proceed to give an incorrect explanation, and then asked if it was wrong. Someone simply told you it was in fact wrong -- which apparently didn&#x27;t meet your expectations. If you wanted someone to explain it to you, why not ask for an explanation or for critique rather than to _expect_ a total stranger to correct all of your understanding out of the goodness of their heart?<p>Why not just come out and state &quot;Someone please offer me their valuable time to explain physics exactly at my level and at my pace. Thanks!&quot;\n\n      &gt; why would matter curve spacetime<p>Perhaps because that&#x27;s just how matter and spacetime work?<p>I mean, you could ask the same question just about anything in physics. Why is there such a thing inertia at all, for example? You can try explaining things in terms of other things, but at some point you inevitably have to arrive at &quot;it&#x27;s just how the universe works&quot;.\n\n  Well, not really.<p>The expansion of the universe is not responsible for explaining gravity, it was observed and aided in determining models and constants for the theory.<p>Start by looking at a particles property called mass.\nMass interacts with the higgs field by exchanging a particle of information called the higgs boson.\nThe interaction strength, corresponding to mass, determines how much the space time around our particle curves.\nSpace time curvature dictates a particles movement.\nNow throw another particle with mass next to the initial one, also interacting with the higgs field.\nThis is when you get into a huge loop of interacting movements and fields.<p>Locally and classically we approximate it by the classical law of gravity which loosely states that two masses attract each other, depending on how close they are, i.e. G<i>M</i>m&#x2F;r^2<p>The universe expanding or contracting is a consequence of mass and gravotational fields, not the other way around.\nAnd calculating the expansion and thus curvature of the universe gives you a picture of the average mass distribution.\n\nThe top reddit answer in wrong in the most irritating way. And Higgs boson has nothing to do with gravity. And Higgs boson interaction only accounts for 1% of the mass of matter.<p>According to relativity, energy IS mass and Higgs field gives non zero energy to Higgs boson.\n\n  Neither the OP nor the top answer on Reddit mentioned the Higgs boson. You&#x27;re right, but I&#x27;m not sure who you&#x27;re rebutting.\n\nI would say gravity is a force, how the heck is this 100lb weight a 100lb weight?\n\n  <i>&gt; how the heck is this 100lb weight a 100lb weight?</i><p>Because the scale that reads 100 lb is pushing up on the weight. The same would be true if the scale was inside a rocket accelerating at 1 g in deep space, far from all gravitating bodies. (This is called the equivalence principle.) In other words, the 100 lb of force you are calling &quot;weight&quot; is <i>not</i> a &quot;force of gravity&quot;; there is no such thing. It&#x27;s a non-gravitational force exerted by the scale on the weight.\n\n    The force drawing the weight and the mass of the earth &#x27;under&#x27; it together (with the scale in the middle) however clearly exists as much as the electromagnetic force though.<p>Or stars, planets, etc. wouldn&#x27;t (and couldn&#x27;t) exist.<p>As to the exact details of how we account for it is another matter. Calling gravity &#x27;measured spacetime curvature&#x27; or &#x27;gravitational force&#x27;, or coming up with pseudo particles, or whatever, is an accounting method. Either way, it&#x27;s still there.<p>But it does clearly exist, as much as light (for example) does. All one needs to do to prove that is look out the window.\n\n      <i>&gt; The force drawing the weight and the mass of the earth &#x27;under&#x27; it together</i><p>There is no such force. Think of the accelerating rocket: there is no &quot;force drawing the weight and the scale together&quot;. There is just the rocket pushing. The same is true standing on the Earth: there is just the ground pushing.<p>One of the reasons we need &quot;spacetime curvature&quot; in GR is to explain how the ground can be pushing things in <i>different directions</i> in different parts of the Earth, while all those things still remain stationary relative to the Earth&#x27;s center and each other. But the whole point is that, even with all that factored in, there is still <i>no</i> &quot;force drawing the weight and the Earth together&quot;. There is just the ground pushing up, plus spacetime geometry to account for the global configuration. That&#x27;s it.\n\n        Except that clearly isn&#x27;t it, as the weight moves even if there is no &#x27;ground&#x27; (say at altitude) in the same predictable fashion, until it collides with something - which merely attempts to arrest it&#x27;s movement. In fact, in orbit the forces felt are still (quite clearly) there too.<p>So if anything, gravity wise &#x27;pushing&#x27; is not a property of gravity at all. Merely of matter which happens to produce the spacetime distortions which result in gravity. Unless dark matter exists, which would be neat.<p>Or the moon wouldn&#x27;t continue to be up there, instead of &#x27;down here&#x27;.<p>And clouds of hydrogen atoms will eventually collect together in a vacuum barring other outside gravitational influences. Which is notably why we even have a star.<p>And the weight itself also has measurable (albeit extremely tiny) such effects on everything else too.<p>So how do you model&#x2F;name&#x2F;account for that force which causes that to occur? Since it does clearly exist.<p>Because a rocket doesn&#x27;t just &#x27;push&#x27; either. We can clearly model the chemical and physics behaviors going on there to generate that &#x27;push&#x27;, and all involve forces which we can account for. None of them meaningfully appear to be gravity.<p>And gravity also involve forces (spacetime distortions causing very real effects!). Which we can also account for.<p>So seriously, what are you even talking about?\n\n          <i>&gt; the weight moves even if there is no &#x27;ground&#x27; (say at altitude) in the same predictable fashion</i><p>&quot;Moves&quot; is frame-dependent. In the weight&#x27;s own rest frame, it is the Earth that moves.<p>What is <i>not</i> frame-dependent is the fact that, if there is no ground and the weight (wrong word, as we&#x27;ll see in a moment) is freely falling, there is <i>no</i> &quot;weight&quot;--the object feels <i>no</i> force and an accelerometer attached to it reads zero. This was the basic insight that started Einstein on the road to curved spacetime and General Relativity: if an object falls freely, it will not feel its own weight.<p><i>&gt; how do you model&#x2F;name&#x2F;account for that force which causes that to occur?</i><p>Using the word &quot;force&quot; here is already wrong as far as General Relativity is concerned: in General Relativity gravity is not a force.<p><i>&gt; a rocket doesn&#x27;t just &#x27;push&#x27; either. We can clearly model the chemical and physics behaviors going on there to generate that &#x27;push&#x27;, and all involve forces which we can account for. None of them meaningfully appear to be gravity.</i><p>Yes, exactly. Now apply the <i>same</i> principle to the Earth pushing up on the weight. We can clearly model all of the microscopic behaviors that lead to that push and the forces that account for them--and <i>none of them are gravity</i>.<p><i>&gt; gravity also involve forces (spacetime distortions causing very real effects!)</i><p>The &quot;spacetime distortions&quot; you refer to, which do indeed cause real effects, are <i>not</i> &quot;forces&quot;. That&#x27;s the whole point. They are spacetime geometry. Spacetime geometry is not a force. That is what General Relativity says.<p><i>&gt; what are you even talking about?</i><p>I am talking about standard General Relativity, as it has been understood and taught in textbooks for decades now. What are <i>you</i> talking about?\n\n            GR agrees (recognizing the obvious caveats) with the classical law of F = Gm₁m₂&#x2F;r², where F stands for &quot;force&quot;. This force is caused by spacetime curvature.\n\n              No, GR says that the Newtonian law of gravity is an <i>approximation</i> that makes reasonably accurate predictions when the spacetime curvature is small and all relative motions are slow compared to the speed of light. It does <i>not</i> say that the Newtonian <i>interpretation</i> of that equation is correct.\n\n                &gt; GR says that the Newtonian law of gravity is an approximation that makes reasonably accurate predictions when the spacetime curvature is small and all relative motions are slow compared to the speed of light.<p>These are merely the aforementioned caveats.<p>&gt; It does not say that the Newtonian interpretation of that equation is correct.<p>If the interpretation were wrong, and that&#x27;s not a force, then the amount of force in that equation would be 0.<p>With no force, Gm₁m₂&#x2F;r² = 0.<p>However, that&#x27;s not the modification that GR applies to this, though.\n\n                  <i>&gt; If the interpretation were wrong, and that&#x27;s not a force, then the amount of force in that equation would be 0.<p>With no force, Gm₁m₂&#x2F;r² = 0.</i><p>Nonsense. The GR interpretation is that G m1 m2 &#x2F; r^2, when it is nonzero, is describing an effect of spacetime geometry, not a force. It can&#x27;t be a force in GR because it isn&#x27;t felt; an object moving solely under the influence of G m1 m2 &#x2F; r^2 feels no weight--an accelerometer attached to it reads zero. GR does not change the <i>numerical value</i> of G m1 m2 &#x2F; r^2 at all. It just reinterprets what the quantity represents.\n\n                    This is the bookkeeping&#x2F;accounting part of it, BTW.<p>It clearly exists (as a thing).<p>What we decide to call it, and how we account for it, while important, doesn&#x27;t make it <i>not exist</i> in reality.<p>Despite the motte and bailey argument to the contrary.\n\n        Here is where an have a problem. The ground isn’t “pushing”. The ground is resisting my weight, and may even be compressed as a result.\n\n          If you&#x27;re just standing in an elevator, how can you tell the difference between the floor of the elevator &quot;resisting&quot; your weight due to gravity, vs. being out in space with silent rockets propelling the elevator at 9.8 m&#x2F;s^2 and &quot;pushing&quot; you?<p>Either way you&#x27;ll feel like you and the elevator floor are being pushed together, and both you and the floor will experience some compression.\n\n            Very true you cannot tell the difference.<p>That was not the question, though. The earth isn’t pushing back.\n\n              I&#x27;m saying the distinction between &quot;resisting&quot; and &quot;pushing&quot; isn&#x27;t real.<p>When a rocket is accelerating and you are pressed against the back and being driven forward, is the rocket &quot;pushing&quot; you or &quot;resisting&quot; you? Either one is a fine way of describing it. The net result, though, is that you are squished into the back of the rocket in a way that&#x27;s completely indistinguishable from gravity.<p>You may say &quot;but the ground can never push me away from the ground.&quot; Sure, but the back of the rocket can&#x27;t push you away from the back of the rocket either, and yet it is clearly pushing you through space. So long as the rocket keeps accelerating, you are being pushed forward, yet you won&#x27;t feel it as a push, you&#x27;ll feel it as an attraction to the back of the rocket.\n\n              <i>&gt; The earth isn’t pushing back.</i><p>Yes, it is. The force you feel as weight <i>is</i> the ground pushing on you.<p>By Newton&#x27;s Third Law, the ground also feels a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction from you, which can, as you say, end up compressing the ground. But that isn&#x27;t what <i>you</i> feel as weight.\n\n                Consider if it is mud. Quicksand. Water.<p>You will start to sink at various rates. Not because water is “pushing less” than earth. It’s because water is not resisting.<p>Also, if I am 200 pounds and the earth is pushing up on me with 200 pounds of force, what is generating that force? And where does it go if a helicopter reels me in? The 200 pounds up “force” just vanishes?<p>Or never existed.\n\n                  <i>&gt; You will start to sink at various rates. Not because water is “pushing less” than earth. It’s because water is not resisting.</i><p>Um, &quot;is not resisting&quot; <i>means</i> &quot;pushing less&quot;. The water does not exert as much force on you as solid ground would. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> you sink. If the water was not pushing less, <i>you wouldn&#x27;t sink</i>.<p><i>&gt; if I am 200 pounds and the earth is pushing up on me with 200 pounds of force, what is generating that force?</i><p>Nothing has to &quot;generate&quot; the force. The force is a static force that is doing no work, so no energy is being consumed. It&#x27;s just static electromagnetic repulsion between your atoms and the atoms in the ground.<p><i>&gt; where does it go if a helicopter reels me in?</i><p>If you stop making contact with the ground, there is no longer any electromagnetic repulsion between your atoms and the atoms in the ground.<p><i>&gt; The 200 pounds up “force” just vanishes?</i><p>The &quot;up&quot; force <i>from the ground</i> vanishes, yes. See above.<p>But of course there is another &quot;up&quot; force on you now from whatever is attaching you to the helicopter.\n\n            But that is not the same setup. The setup here is: a body on the surface of a much larger body: is there pushing or pulling?<p>I suggest to GP to consider the body lifted and then released. The body is moving back towards the larger body. It meets a rigid boundary and comes to rest (or bounces ..) When did the ground start &quot;pushing&quot; the body? It seems the smaller body was being acted on by something (we say curved space) which is motivating it towards the center of the gravity of the larger body. This motivation (spatial deformation or force, whatever) doesn&#x27;t cease and the rigidity of the larger body is engendering the equal opposing &#x27;force&#x27; pushing back against it.\n\n    This is my first time hearing this. I don&#x27;t study physics much but this doesn&#x27;t sound right at all. You&#x27;re telling me if I drop something there is no force pulling it down? That makes no sense.\n\n      <i>&gt; You&#x27;re telling me if I drop something there is no force pulling it down?</i><p>Yes. You and the ground are being pushed upwards by a force. You can feel that force--it&#x27;s your weight. The dropped object falls <i>relative to you</i> precisely because it does <i>not</i> feel any force--it is weightless. This is exactly the same thing that would happen in a rocket whose engine was firing in deep space, far from all gravitating bodies. This is an example of the equivalence principle, which is a central <i>experimental</i> fact that Newtonian gravity just had to accept as being true for no apparent reason, but which GR accounts for naturally as an aspect of spacetime geometry.\n\nThe top answer given here is highly reductionist to the point of misleading.

It&#x27;s a lovely resource\n\n  Please forgive my response being a little meta, but it bothers me that 95% of discussions where physics &quot;experts&quot; are clarifying something to laymen is those experts clarifying that some factor is actually well understood and makes complete sense and is firmly under the belt of the academic and research community if you just had the knowledge to understand why. Almost never through these same discussions is there acknowledgement or discussion of the unknowns, limitations, or unsolved problems. Judging from years of anecdotal exposure to these &quot;clarifications for the laymen&quot; one would assume absolutely nothing is unsolved in physics.\n\n    Those can both be true at the same time. Physics has unsolved problems -- that doesn&#x27;t mean that the problems that come up <i>for laymen</i> are unsolved.\n\n      It seems like the mismatch between technical definitions and common ones and&#x2F;or the nature of mathematical models vs our first person experience of the universe is a common source of confusion.<p>I only have an EE’s understanding of physics, so just a tiny bit of modern physics and some semiconductor stuff.

It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t have similar examples in computer science - when talking with laypeople, we provide generalizations and abstractions.

Experimentation is all we need. Nothing in this can be determined without error.  It is easier to believe it is not true.

See &#x27;gravitational lensing&#x27; for some cool photographic evidence :).<p>The Higg&#x27;s Boson gives mass to many particles; this might be part of what you&#x27;re thinking of.<p>Whether gravity is described by bosons at its deepest level is strictly speaking an open question, though many models of quantum gravity treat it this way.\n\n    Gravity does not bend light or move photons.<p>Gravity changes the path light has to take, photons keep going where they were going in the first place.<p>Light doesn&#x27;t escape a black hole because it is being pulled by gravity, it is just being given an infinite path to travel so it never gets there.\n\nIt doesn&#x27;t. Modern cosmology is so full of holes. Nothing can be determined through experiment.\n\nTo me it seems the equivalence principle is actually false. It was an inspiration to come up with general relativity but the resulting theory supports it kind of, but not really. To start out with, it only holds either looking at an infinitesimal extent of space or in a homogeneous gravitational field. As soon as the gravitational field cannot be seen as homogeneous, you are going to know that you are falling instead of floating through space. E.g., spaghettification near a black hole. Another case in point is the somewhat well-known question if a falling electron radiates. Yes, it should, but that violates the equivalence principle.\n\n  My understanding is that the equivalence principle only applies to a specific, local region of space time, and this region could be arbitrarily small.<p>Tidal forces are only measurable across something with size, by measuring a difference between one point and another.<p>Even if your body is being spaghettified, an arbitrarily small region of your body still can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s under anything but freefall.\n\nI was wondering exactly that same thing just yesterday!\n\nGravity is a bit different than the other forces because it is the only mechanism by which all known particles interact with all other known particles (since all particles have an association with the stress-energy tensor).\n\nGravity is a compression algorithm, for more efficient processing of matter in contiguous batches.\n\nThere is a modern explanation for gravity that is actually rather simple and strongly cohesive. But it doesn&#x27;t align with modern orthodoxy, so it&#x27;s not worth mentioning here.\n\nCan someone please present the argument for why gravity is not a force? This makes no sense to me.\n\n  ScienceClic on Youtube has amazing videos on this topic as does Veritasium. Einstein&#x27;s happiest thought helps with understanding this. He thought that there would be no discernible difference between what a man felt while falling off a ladder (let&#x27;s not factor in air resistance) and what a person in 0g space felt.<p>We are actually &quot;accelerating&quot; upwards at a constant rate that is equal to what we feel and many think of as gravity. This is because spacetime is curved by the mass of the earth.<p>Think of a grid being distorted or squeezed &#x2F; pinched. The distortion pinching is &quot;gravity&quot;. Everything in the grid still travels in a straight path relative tot he lines on the grid but since the [spacetime] grid is pinched, it looks as if it is not on a straight path.\n\n    Thank you\n\n  There&#x27;s quite a lot of arguments back and forth about it through this whole thread if you really want to dive into it. The cliff notes is effectively that gravity is not a force in GR. It is considered a force in newtonian physics, and might be a force again if we ever make a Theory of Everything. Gravity is fairly akin to a force in string theory, so if they do end up being right, gravity would be a force. If the Loop Quantum Gravity folks are right, gravity will remain not a force. If it&#x27;s some other theory, who knows what it&#x27;ll end up being.\n\n    I&#x27;m not about to comb through threads on Hacker News and synthesize a theory from comments by people who may or may not know what they&#x27;re talking about. But thanks.\n\n      johncarlosbaez is about as real deal of a physicist as they come, and pdonis is a nuclear engineer with a degree from MIT who is a longstanding mentor on the largest physics discussion forum in the world. I&#x27;d recommend reading their posts if you are curious about the take on this question from people well educated in the subject.\n\nGravity might not be a force, but it is described by a field theory. And field theories can&#x2F;must be quantized. So the question is really just a different way of asking, if we need to quantize gravity: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6980&#x2F;what-are-the-reasons-to-expect-that-gravity-should-be-quantized\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6980&#x2F;what-are-th...</a>"

      "conversation_text": "The TL:DR; is that the build step masks the wait for input from a shell pipe. With a side dish of &quot;do buffered input&quot; and then a small &quot;avoid memory allocation for fun.&quot;\n\nYou can easily hit a similar problem in other languages too. For example, in Rust, std::fs::File isn&#x27;t buffered, so reading single bytes from it will also be rather slow.\n\nThere is general wisdom about bash pipelines here that I think most people will miss simply because of the title. Interesting though, my mental model of bash piping was wrong too.\n\n  We are two!\n\n  There were several reasons why pipes were added to Unix, and the ability to run producer&#x2F;consumer processes concurrently was one of them. Before that (and for many years after on non-Unix systems) indeed the most prevalent paradigm were to run multi-stage pipelines with the moral equivalent of the following:<p><pre><code>    stage1.exe &#x2F;in:input.dat &#x2F;out:stage1.dat\n    stage2.exe &#x2F;in:stage1.dat &#x2F;out:stage2.dat\n    del stage1.dat\n    stage3.exe &#x2F;in:stage2.dat &#x2F;out:result.dat\n    del stage2.dat</code></pre>\n\n    Pipes are so useful. I find myself more and more using shell script and pipes for complex multi-stage tasks. This also simplifies any non-shell code I must write, as there are already high quality, performant implementations of hashing and compression algorithms I can just pipe to.\n\n      &quot;The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: “Master programmer, consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten thousand lines?”&quot;<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;writings&#x2F;unix-koans&#x2F;ten-thousand.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;writings&#x2F;unix-koans&#x2F;ten-thousand.html</a>\n\n        Ugh. I don’t feel that the spirit of those satirical Zen Koans is to be so self-congratulatory.\n\n      What programming language do you use where there isn&#x27;t performant hashing&#x2F;compression algorithms implemented as libraries?\n\n        Well they all do, but in terms of ease of use, tar and zip are much simpler to implement in a cli pipeline than to write bespoke code. At least that has been my experience.\n\n          It is hard to compete with &quot;| gzip&quot; in any programming language. Just importing a library and you&#x27;re already well past that. Just typing &quot;import&quot; and you&#x27;re tied! Overbudget if I drop the space in &quot;| gzip&quot;.<p>This is one of the reasons why, for all its faults, shell just isn&#x27;t going anywhere any time soon.\n\n            It <i>is</i> hard to compete with.<p>You can also (assuming your language supports it), execute gzip, and assuming your language gives you some writable-handle to the pipe, then write data into it. So, you get the concurrency &quot;for free&quot;, but you don&#x27;t have to go all the way to &quot;do all of it in process&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve also done the &quot;trick&quot; of executing [bash, -c, &lt;stuff&gt;] in a higher language, too. I&#x27;d personally rather see the work better suited for the high language done in the higher language, but if shell is easier, then as such it is.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like unsafe blocks: minimize the shell to a reasonable portion, clearly define the inputs&#x2F;outputs, and make sure you&#x27;re not vulnerable to shell-isms, as best as you can, at the boundary.<p>But I still think I see the reverse far more often. Like, `steam` is … all the time, apparently … exec&#x27;ing a shell to then exec … xdg-user-dir? (And the error seems to indicate that that&#x27;s it…) Which seems more like the sort of &quot;you could just exec this yourself?&quot;. (But Steam is also mostly a web-app of sorts, so, for all I know there&#x27;s JS under there, and I think node is one of those &quot;makes exec(2) hard&#x2F;impossible&quot; langs.)\n\n              import os\nimport os.subprocess #is that right?\nsubprocess.execute(f&#x27;tar cvzf t.tar.gz {&#x27; &#x27;.join(list_of_files)}&#x27;)<p>Did I do that right?<p>or was it<p>`tar cvzf t.tar.gz *`\n\n                <p><pre><code>    import subprocess\n\n    subprocess.run([&#x27;tar&#x27;, &#x27;cvzf&#x27;, &#x27;t.tar.gz&#x27;, *list_of_files])\n</code></pre>\nor indeed<p><pre><code>    import os, subprocess\n\n    subprocess.run([&#x27;tar&#x27;, &#x27;cvzf&#x27;, &#x27;t.tar.gz&#x27;, *(f.path for f in os.scandir(&#x27;.&#x27;))])\n</code></pre>\nif you need files from the current directory\n\n      My biggest annoyance is when I get some tooling from some other team, and they&#x27;re like &quot;oh just extend this Python script&quot;. It&#x27;ll operate on local files, using shell commands, in a non-reentrant way, with only customization from commenting out code. Maybe there&#x27;s some argparse but you end up writing a program using their giant args as primitives.<p>Guys just write small programs and chain them. The wisdom of the ancients is continuously lost.\n\n        I would recommend the python sh module instead of writing bash for more complex code. Python’s devenv and tooling is way more mature and safer.\n\n        Python comes with a built-in module called fileinput that makes this very easy. It checks sys.argv[1] and reads from it or from stdin if it&#x27;s empty or a dash.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;fileinput.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;fileinput.html</a>\n\n        It&#x27;s just a preference thing, I loathe the small program chaining style and cannot work with it at all. Give me a python script and I&#x27;m good though. I can&#x27;t for the life of me imagine why people would want to do pseudo programming through piping magic when chaining is so limited compared to actual programming\n\n          Chaining pipes in python is quite obnoxious.\n\n          This is of course a false dichotomy, there&#x27;s nothing pseudo about using bash (perhaps you mean sudo?) and bash scripts orchestrate what you call &#x27;actual&#x27; programs.<p>I commonly write little python scripts to filter logs, which I have read from stdin. That means I can filter a log to stdout:<p><pre><code>   cat logfile.log | python parse_logs.py\n</code></pre>\nOr filter them as they&#x27;re generated:<p><pre><code>   tail -f logfile.log | python parse_logs.py\n</code></pre>\nOr write the filtered output to a file:<p><pre><code>   cat logfile.log | python parse_logs.py &gt; filtered.log \n</code></pre>\nOr both:<p><pre><code>   tail -f logfile.log | python parse_logs.py | tee filtered.log\n</code></pre>\nIt would be possible, I suppose, to configure a single python script to do all those things, with flags or whatever.<p>But who on Earth has the time for that?\n\n    Sometimes you want the intermediate files as well, though. For example, if doing some kind of exploratory analysis of the different output stages of the pipeline, or even just for debugging.<p>Tee can be useful for that. Maybe pv (pipe viewer) too. I have not tried it yet.\n\n  ...how ? It&#x27;s called pipe, not &quot;infinitely large buffer that will wait indefintely till the command ends to pass its output further&quot;\n\n    Can’t speak for OP, but one might reasonably expect later stages to only start execution once <i>at least some</i> data is available—rather than immediately, before any data is available for them to consume.<p>Of course, there many reasons you wouldn’t want this—processes can take time to start up, for example—but it’s not an unreasonable mental model.\n\n      Not even that they might be particularly slow to start in absolute terms, but just that they might be slow relative to how fast the previous stage starts cranking out some input for it.<p>(Since, as GP said, not an infinite buffer.)\n\n      Well, it could be implemented like this, it&#x27;s just more cumbersome than &quot;create N-1 anonymous pipes, fork N processes, wait for the last process to finish&quot;: at the very least you&#x27;ll need to select() on the last unattached pipe, and when job control comes into the picture, you&#x27;d really would like the &quot;setting up the pipeline&quot; and &quot;monitoring the pipeline&#x27;s execution&quot; parts to be disentangled.\n\n    I know this about Unix pipes from a very long time. Whenever they are introduced it is always said, but I guess people can miss it.<p>Though now I will break your mind as my mind was broken not a long time ago. Powershell, which is often said to be a better shell, works like that. It doesn&#x27;t run things in parallel. I think the same is to be said about Windows cmd&#x2F;batch, but don&#x27;t cite me on that. That one thing makes Powershell insufficient to ever be a full replacement of a proper shell.\n\n      Not exactly. Non-native PowerShell pipelines are executed in a single thread, but the steps are interleaved, not buffered. That is, each object is passed through the whole pipeline before the next object is processed. This is non-ideal for high-performance data processing (e.g. `cat`ing a 10GB file, searching through it and gzipping the output), but for 99% of daily commands, it does not make any difference.<p>cmd.exe uses standard OS pipes and behaves the same as UNIX shells, same as Powershell invoking native binaries.\n\n        Oh, that&#x27;s what I missed! I managed to find out about it while trying to do an equivalent of `curl ... | tar xzf -` in Powershell. I was stumped. I guess the thing is that a Unix shell would do a subshell automatically.\n\n      &gt; Though now I will break your mind as my mind was broken not a long time ago. Powershell, which is often said to be a better shell, works like that. It doesn&#x27;t run things in parallel. I think the same is to be said about Windows cmd&#x2F;batch, but don&#x27;t cite me on that. That one thing makes Powershell insufficient to ever be a full replacement of a proper shell.<p>A Pipeline is PowerShell is definitely streaming unless you accidentally forces the output into a list&#x2F;array at some point, e.g. try this for yourself (somewhere you can interrupt the script obviously as it&#x27;s going to run forever)<p><pre><code>    class InfiniteEnumerator : System.Collections.IEnumerator\n    {\n        hidden [ulong]$countMod2e64 = 0\n\n        [object] get_Current()\n        {\n            return $this.countMod2e64\n        }\n        \n        [bool] MoveNext() {\n            $this.countMod2e64 += 1\n            return $true\n        }\n        \n        Reset() {\n            $this.countMod2e64 = 0\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    class InfiniteEnumerable : System.Collections.IEnumerable {\n        InfiniteEnumerable() {}\n        \n        [System.Collections.IEnumerator] GetEnumerator() {\n            return [InfiniteEnumerator]::new()\n        }\n    }\n\n    [InfiniteEnumerable]::new() | ForEach-Object { Write-Host &quot;Element number mod 2^64: $_&quot; }\n</code></pre>\nWhether it runs in parallel depends on the implementation of each side. Interpreted powershell code does not run in parallel unless you run it a job, use ForEach-Object -Parallel, or explicitly put it on another thread. But the data is not collected together before being sent from one step from the next.\n\n        More compact example (not to scare the POSIX people away :) ):<p><pre><code>    0..1000000 | where {$_ % 10 -eq 0} | foreach {&quot;Got Value: $_&quot;}</code></pre>\n\n          The streaming behavior of the range operator is weird though. This is tested on PowerShell 7.4.1<p><pre><code>    &gt; 0..1000000000 | % { $_ }\n    # Starts printing out numbers immediately\n    &gt; 0..1000000000\n    # Hangs longer than I had patience to wait for\n    &gt; $x=0..100\n    &gt; $x.GetType()\n    # IsPublic IsSerial Name     BaseType\n    # -------- -------- ----     --------\n    # True     True     Object[] System.Array\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s an array when I save it in a variable, but it&#x27;s obviously not an array on the LHS of a pipe.\n\n    Pipe, |, was also commonly used as an &quot;OR&quot; operator. I wonder if the idea that you could &quot;pipe&quot; data between commands came later.\n\n      I think the math usage was first. i.e. absolute value: |x|\n\n        The language APL\\360 of IBM (August 1968) and the other APL dialects that have followed it have used a single &quot;|&quot; as a monadic prefix operator that computes the absolute value and also as a dyadic infix operator that computes the remainder of the division (but with the operand order reversed in comparison with the language C, which is usually much more convenient, especially in APL, where this order avoids the need for parentheses in most cases).\n\n        Not to get all semiotic about it, but |x| notation is a pair of vertical lines. I&#x27;m sure that <i>someone</i> has written a calculator program where two 0x7D characters bracketing a symbol means absolute value, but if I&#x27;ve ever seen it, I can&#x27;t recall.<p>Although 0x7D is overly specific, since if a sibling comment is correct (I have no reason to think otherwise), | for bitwise OR originates in PL&#x2F;1, where it would have been encoded in EBCDIC, which codes it as 0x4F.<p>I&#x27;m not really disagreeing with you, the |abs| notation is quite a bit older than computers, just musing on what should count as the first use of &quot;|&quot;. I&#x27;m inclined to say that it should go to the first use of <i>an</i> encoding of &quot;|&quot;, not to the similarly-appearing pen and paper notation, and definitely not the first use of ASCII &quot;|&quot; aka 0x7D in a programming language. But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a right answer here, it&#x27;s a matter of taste.<p>Because one could argue back to the Roman numeral I, if one were determined to do so: when written sans serif, it&#x27;s just a vertical line, after all. Somehow, abs notation and &quot;first use of an encoded vertical bar&quot; both seem reasonable, while the Roman numeral and specifically-ASCII don&#x27;t, but I doubt I can unpack that intuition in any detail.\n\n      The character &quot;|&quot; has been introduced in computers in the language NPL at IBM in December 1964 as a notation for bitwise OR, replacing &quot;.OR.&quot;, which had been used by IBM in its previous programming language, &quot;FORTRAN IV&quot; (OR was between dots to distinguish it from identifiers, marking it as an operator).<p>The next year the experimental NPL (New Programming Language) has been rebranded as PL&#x2F;I and it has become a commercial product of IBM.<p>Following PL&#x2F;I, other programming languages have begun to use &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;|&quot; for AND and OR, including the B language, the predecessor of C.<p>The pipe and its notation have been introduced in the Third Edition of UNIX (based on a proposal made by M. D. McIlroy), in 1972, so after the language B had been used for a few years and before the development of C. The oldest documentation about pipes that I have seen is in &quot;UNIX Programmer&#x27;s Manual Third Edition&quot; from February 1973.<p>Before NPL, the vertical bar had already been used in the Backus-Naur notation introduced in the report about ALGOL 60 as a separator between alternatives in the description of the grammar of the language, so with a meaning somewhat similar to OR.\n\n        &gt;as a notation for bitwise OR, replacing &quot;.OR.&quot;, which had been used by IBM in its previous programming language, &quot;FORTRAN IV&quot;.<p>Untrue: &quot;.OR.&quot; in FORTRAN meant ordinary OR, not <i>bitwise</i> OR. I don&#x27;t remember ever seeing bitwise OR or AND or XOR in FORTRAN IV.\n\n          That is right, but I did not want to provide too many details that did not belong to the topic.<p>FORTRAN IV did not have bit strings, it had only Boolean values (&quot;LOGICAL&quot;).<p>Therefore all the logical operators could be applied only to Boolean operands, giving a Boolean result.<p>The same was true for all earlier high-level programming languages.<p>The language NPL, renamed PL&#x2F;I in 1965, has been the first high-level programming language that has introduced bit string values, so the AND, OR and NOT operators could operate on bit strings, not only on single Boolean values.<p>If PL&#x2F;I would have remained restricted to the smaller character set accepted by FORTRAN IV in source texts, they would have retained the FORTRAN IV operators &quot;.NOT.&quot;, &quot;.AND.&quot;, &quot;.OR.&quot;, extending their meaning as bit string operators.<p>However IBM has decided to extend the character set, which has allowed the use of dedicated symbols for the logical operators and also for other operators that previously had to use keywords, like the relational operators, and also for new operators introduced by PL&#x2F;I, like the concatenation operator.\n\n    Usually mental models develop &quot;organically&quot; from when one was a n00b, without much thought, and sometimes it can take a long time for them to be unseated, even though it&#x27;s kind of obvious in hindsight that the mental model is wrong (e.g. one can see that from &quot;slow-program | less&quot;, and things like that).\n\n      I think a main reason for this is that you can have a &quot;good enough&quot; working mental model of a process, that holds up to your typical use cases and even moderate scrutiny.  It&#x27;s often only once you run into a case where your mental model fails that you even think to challenge the assumptions it was built on - at least, this has been my experience.\n\n    That is called a sponge!<p><pre><code>  SPONGE(1)                          moreutils                         SPONGE(1)\n\n  NAME\n         sponge - soak up standard input and write to a file\n\n  SYNOPSIS\n         sed &#x27;...&#x27; file | grep &#x27;...&#x27; | sponge [-a] file\n\n  DESCRIPTION\n         sponge reads standard input and writes it out to the specified file.\n         Unlike a shell redirect, sponge soaks up all its input before writing\n         the output file. This allows constructing pipelines that read from and\n         write to the same file.</code></pre>\n\n    DOS also has a &quot;pipe&quot;, which works exactly like that. (Obviously, since DOS can&#x27;t run multiple programs in parallel.)\n\nMy first guess involved caching but I was thinking about whether the binary itself had to be read from disk or was already cached in RAM.  Great linux-fu post.\n\nI was so confused about why this mattered&#x2F;made <i>such</i> a difference - until I went back and re-read from the top: OP does the benchmark timing in `main`, in the Zig app under test.<p>If you don&#x27;t do that, if you use the `time` CLI for example, this wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem in the first place. Though sure you couldn&#x27;t have compared to compiling fresh &amp; running anyway, and at least on small inputs would&#x27;ve wanted to do the input prep first anyway.<p>But I think if you put the benchmark code inside the DUT you&#x27;re setting yourself up for all kinds of gotchas like this.\n\nI don&#x27;t want to belittle the author, but I am surprised, that people using a low-level language on Linux wouldn&#x27;t know how Unix pipelines work or that reading one byte per syscall is quite inefficient. I understand that the author is still learning (aren&#x27;t we all?), but I just felt it is a pretty fundamental knowledge. At the same time author managed to have better performance that the official thing had. I guess many things feel fundamental in the retrospect.\n\n  Author here.<p>Thanks for reading!<p>&gt;<i>I am surprised, that people using a low-level language on Linux wouldn&#x27;t know ... that reading one byte per syscall is quite inefficient.</i><p>In my defense, it wasn&#x27;t that I didn&#x27;t realize one byte per syscall was inefficient; it was that I didn&#x27;t realize that I was doing one syscall per byte read.<p>I&#x27;m coming back to low-level programming after 8ish years of Go&#x2F;Python&#x2F;JS, so I wasn&#x27;t really registering that I&#x27;d forgotten to layer in a buffered reader on top of stdin&#x27;s reader.<p>Alex Kladov (matklad) made an interesting point on the Ziggit thread[0] that the Zig standard library could adjust the API to make this kind of mistake less likely:<p>&gt;<i>I’d say readByte is a flawed API to have on a Reader. While you technically can read a byte-at-time from something like TCP socket, it just doesn’t make sense.

That part is more on familiarity with Zig and how intuitive it is or isn&#x27;t.<p>In any case I would recommend anyone investigating things like that to run things through strace. It is often my first step in trying to understand what happens with anything - like a cryptic error &quot;No such file or directory&quot; without telling me what a thing tried to access. You would run:<p>$ strace -f sh -c &#x27;your | pipeline | here&#x27; -o strace.log<p>You could then track things easily and see what is really happening.<p>Cheers!\n\n      Thanks for the tip! I don&#x27;t have experience with strace, and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m misunderstanding what you&#x27;re saying.<p>I tried running your suggested command, and I got 2,800 lines of output like this:<p><pre><code>    execve(&quot;&#x2F;nix&#x2F;store&#x2F;vqvj60h076bhqj6977caz0pfxs6543nb-bash-5.2-p15&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh&quot;, [&quot;sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;echo \\&quot;60016000526001601ff3\\&quot; | xx&quot;...], 0x7fffffffcf38 &#x2F;* 106 vars *&#x2F;) = 0\n    brk(NULL)                               = 0x4ea000\n    arch_prctl(0x3001 &#x2F;* ARCH_??? *&#x2F;, 0x7fffffffcdd0) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)\n    access(&quot;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;ld-nix.so.preload&quot;, R_OK)  = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n    openat(AT_FDCWD, &quot;&#x2F;nix&#x2F;store&#x2F;aw2fw9ag10wr9pf0qk4nk5sxi0q0bn56-glibc-2.37-8&#x2F;lib&#x2F;libdl.so.2&quot;, O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\n    read(3, &quot;\\177ELF\\2\\1\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\3\\0&gt;\\0\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0&quot;..., 832) = 832\n    newfstatat(3, &quot;&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0555, st_size=15688, ...}, AT_EMPTY_PATH) = 0\n    mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7ffff7fc2000\n    mmap(NULL, 16400, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0x7ffff7fbd000\n    mmap(0x7ffff7fbe000, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x1000) = 0x7ffff7fbe000\n</code></pre>\nAm I doing it wrong? Or is there more training involved before one could usefully integrate this into debugging? Because to me, the output is pretty inscrutable.\n\n        There is a lot of output here, but you can grep around or filter with strace CLI. If you used -f option you should get PID numbers later on. Then you can look for all execve&#x27;s to see how PIDs map to parts of the pipeline. For now maybe grep the log file with something like: &quot;grep -e clone -e execve -e write -e read&quot;. You can do this with strace CLI, but I never remember the syntax and usually analyze the log extensively.<p>I think something like this could work:<p><pre><code>  strace -f -e execve,clone,write,read -o strace.log sh -c &#x27;...&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nClone is fork, so a creation of a new process, before eventual execve (with echo there will probably be just clone).\n\n        strace tells you every syscall the process under it makes.  So very helpful to understanding how a program interacts with the operating system - and I&#x2F;O as all IO mechanisms are managed by the operating system.<p>As for how to filter this I&#x27;ll leave that to the other comments, but I personally would look at the man page or Google around for tips\n\n    As a very general tip:<p>&gt; execution time:  438.059µs<p>That’s a rather short time. (It’s a lot of <i>cycles</i>, but there are plenty of things one might do on a computer that take time comparable to this, especially anything involving IO.  It’s only a small fraction of a disk head seek if you’re using spinning disks, and it’s only a handful of non-overlapping random accesses even on NVMe.)<p>So, when you benchmark anything and get a time this short, you should make sure you’re benchmarking the right thing. Watch out for fixed costs or correct for them. Run in a loop and see how time varies with iteration count. Consider using a framework that can handle this type of benchmarking.<p>A result like “this program took half a millisecond to run” doesn’t really tell you much about how long any part of it took.\n\n    FWIW, the current version of the code (i.e. with the buffered reader), on my machine at least, runs identically fast with and without the tmp file.<p>Here&#x27;s a possibly more detailed reason as to why <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39764287#39768022\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39764287#39768022</a>.\n\n  I feel like you are underestimating how many fundamental misunderstandings people can have (including both of us) even though they have deep understanding of adjacent issues.\n\n  There are many fundamental things People Should Know™, but we are not LLMs that have ingested entire libraries worth of books.<p>Exploratory programming and being curious about strange effects is a great way to learn the fundamentals. I already knew how pipes and processes work, but I don&#x27;t know the Ethereum VM.\nThe author now knows both.\n\n  It&#x27;s one of those things that you don&#x27;t usually need to think about, so you don&#x27;t.<p>Not too long ago I hit this same realization with pipes because my &quot;grep ... file | sed &gt; file&quot; (or something of that nature) was racey.<p>I took the time to think about it and realized &quot;oh I guess that&#x27;s how pipes would _have_ to be implemented&quot;.\n\n  This deleterious effect is a factor in computing.  We deal with it every few years: kids graduate, having ignored the history of their elders in order to focus on the new and cool - and once they hit industry, find that they really, really should have learned POSIX or whatever.<p>Its not uncommon.  As a professional developer I have observed this obfuscation of prior technology countless times, especially with junior devs.<p>There is a lot to learn.  Always.  It doesn&#x27;t ever stop.\n\n  This is exactly what surprised me as well. I&#x27;m literally now learning in depth WebStreams[1] in JS (vs the traditional Node Streams) and I&#x27;ve seen too many times the comparison of how &quot;pipe() and pipeTo() behave just like Unix&#x27;s pipes |&quot;. Reading this article makes me think this might not be the best comparison, specially since for many webdevs it&#x27;s the first time for approaching some CS concepts. OTOH, the vast majority of webdevs don&#x27;t really need to learn WebStreams in-depth.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exploringjs.com&#x2F;nodejs-shell-scripting&#x2F;ch_web-streams.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exploringjs.com&#x2F;nodejs-shell-scripting&#x2F;ch_web-stream...</a>\n\n  Most people have gaps somewhere in their knowledge. I learned very on, as a general superstition, to always try and batch things that dealt with the world without like file writes, allocations, network requests etc. But for years I had no idea what a syscall even was.\n\nAlso a great reminder to always benchmark with different data set sizes.\n\nI realize one needs a catchy title and some storytelling to get people to read a blog article, but for a summary of the main points:<p>* This is not about a build step that makes the app perform better<p>* The app isn&#x27;t 10x faster (or faster at all; it&#x27;s the same binary)<p>* The author ran a benchmark two ways, one of which inadvertently included the time taken to generate sample input data, because it was coming from a pipe<p>* Generating the data before starting the program under test fixes the measurement\n\n  Another semi-summary of the core part of the article:<p>&gt;&quot;echo &#x27;60016000526001601ff3&#x27; | xxd -r -p | zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast&quot; is much faster than &quot;echo &#x27;60016000526001601ff3&#x27; | xxd -r -p | .&#x2F;zig-out&#x2F;bin&#x2F;count-bytes&quot; (compiling + running the program is faster than just running an already-compiled program)<p>&gt;When you execute the program directly, xxd and count-bytes start at the same time, so the pipe buffer is empty when count-bytes first tries to read from stdin, requiring it to wait until xxd fills it. But when you use zig build run, xxd gets a head start while the program is compiling, so by the time count-bytes reads from stdin, the pipe buffer has been filled.<p>&gt;Imagine a simple bash pipeline like the following: &quot;.&#x2F;jobA | .&#x2F;jobB&quot;. My mental model was that jobA would start and run to completion and then jobB would start with jobA’s output as its input. It turns out that all commands in a bash pipeline start at the same time.\n\n    That doesn’t make sense unless you have only 1 or 2 physical CPUs with contention. In a modern CPU the latter should be faster and I’m left unsatisfied by the correctness of the explanation. Am I just being thick or is there a more plausible explanation?\n\n      It depends on where the timing code is. If the timer starts after all the data has already been loaded, the time recorded will be lower (even if the total time for the whole process is higher).\n\n        I’m not following how that would result in a 10x discrepancy. The amount of data we’re talking about here is laughably small (it’s like 32 bytes or something)\n\n          &gt; The amount of data we’re talking about here is laughably small<p>So is the runtime.\n\n          I’ll admit to not having looked at the details at all, but a possible explanation is that almost all the time is spent on inter process communication overhead, so if that also happens before the timer starts (eg, the data has been transferred, just waiting to be read from a local buffer) then the measured time will be significantly lower.\n\n      The latter is faster in actual CPU time, however note that TFA the measurement only starts with the program, it does not start with the start of the pipeline.<p>Because the compilation time overlaps with the pipes filling up, blocking on the pipe is mostly excluded from the measurement in the former case (by the time the program starts there’s enough data in the pipe that the program can slurp a bunch of it, especially reading it byte by byte), but included in the latter.\n\n        My hunch is that if you added the buffered reader and kept the original xxd in the pipe you’d see similar timings.<p>The amount of input data is just laughably small here to result in a huge timing discrepancy.<p>I wonder if there’s an added element where the constant syscalls are reading on a contended mutex and that contention disappears if you delay the start of the  program.\n\n          Good hunch. On my machine (13900k) &amp; zig 0.11, the latest version of the code:<p>&gt; INFILE=&quot;$(mktemp)&quot; &amp;&amp; echo $INFILE &amp;&amp; \\\n    echo &#x27;60016000526001601ff3&#x27; | xxd -r -p &gt; &quot;${INFILE}&quot; &amp;&amp; \\\n    zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast &lt; &quot;${INFILE}&quot;\n&gt; execution time:  27.742µs<p>vs<p>&gt; echo &#x27;60016000526001601ff3&#x27; | xxd -r -p | zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast\n&gt; execution time:  27.999µs<p>The idea that the overlap of execution here by itself plays a role is nonsensical. The overlap of execution + reading a byte at a time causing kernel mutex contention seems like a more plausible explanation although I would expect someone better knowledgeable (&amp; more motivated) about capturing kernel perf measurements to confirm. If this is the explanation, I&#x27;m kind of surprised that there isn&#x27;t a lock-free path for pipes in the kernel.\n\n            This\n@mtlynch\n\n              To sanity check myself, I reran this without the buffered reader and still don&#x27;t see the slow execution time:<p>&gt; echo &#x27;60016000526001601ff3&#x27; | xxd -r -p &gt; | zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast<p>&gt; execution time:  28.889µs<p>So I think my machine config for whatever reason isn&#x27;t representative of whatever OP is using.<p>Linux-ck 6.8 CONFIG_NO_HZ=y CONFIG_HZ_1000=y<p>Intel 13900k<p>zig 0.11<p>bash 5.2.26<p>xxd 2024-02-10<p>Would be good if someone that can repro it compares the two invocation variants with buffered reader implemented &amp; lists their config.\n\n            Based on what you&#x27;ve shared, the second version can start reading instantly because &quot;INFILE&quot; was populated in the previous test. Did you clear it between tests?<p>Here are the benchmarks before and after fixing the benchmarking code:<p>Before: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;output.circle-artifacts.com&#x2F;output&#x2F;job&#x2F;2f6666c1-1165-4f10-b62f-267ebaf250c3&#x2F;artifacts&#x2F;0&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;benchmarks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;output.circle-artifacts.com&#x2F;output&#x2F;job&#x2F;2f6666c1-1165...</a><p>After: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;output.circle-artifacts.com&#x2F;output&#x2F;job&#x2F;457cd247-dd7c-4b73-9a09-ea00db7bdfe5&#x2F;artifacts&#x2F;0&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;benchmarks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;output.circle-artifacts.com&#x2F;output&#x2F;job&#x2F;457cd247-dd7c...</a><p>What would explain the drastic performance increase if the pipelining behavior is irrelevant?\n\n              That was just a typo in the comment. The command run locally was just a strait pipe.<p>Using both invocation variants, I ran:<p>8a5ecac63e44999e14cdf16d5ed689d5770c101f (before buffered changes)<p>78188ecbc66af6e5889d14067d4a824081b4f0ad (after buffered changes)<p>On my machine, they&#x27;re all equally fast at ~28 us. Clearly the changes only had an impact on machines with a different configuration (kernel version or kernel config or xxd version or hw).<p>One hypothesis outlined above is that the when you pipeline all 3 applications, the single byte reader version is doing back-to-back syscalls and that&#x27;s causing contention between your code and xxd on a kernel mutex leading to things going to sleep extra long.<p>It&#x27;s not a strong hypothesis though just because of how little data there is and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t repro on my machine. To get a real explanation, I think you have to actually do some profile measurements on a machine that can repro and dig in to obtain a satisfiable explanation of what exactly is causing the problem.\n\n  I would definitely classify the title as <i>clickbait</i> because the app didn&#x27;t go &quot;10x faster&quot;.\n\nIf I were trying to optimize my code, I would start with loading the entire benchmark bytecode to memory, then start the counter. Otherwise I can&#x27;t be sure how much time is spent reading from a pipe&#x2F;file to memory, and how much time is spent in my code.<p>Then I would try to benchmark what happens if it all fits in L1 cache, L2, L3, and main memory.<p>Of course, if the common use case is reading from a file, network, or pipe, maybe you can optimize that, but I would take it step by step.\n\nThis is exactly the thing that feels obvious once you realize it, but that can be puzzling until you don&#x27;t.\n\nThis is an excellent writeup, with interesting ideas and clear description of actions taken. My idea of pipelines, also, was flawed. Well done!<p>Nothing to do with Zig. Just a nice debugging story.\n\nBack in college, a friend of mine decided to learn how to program. He had never programmed before. He picked up the DEC FORTRAN-10 manual and read it cover to cover.<p>He then wrote a program that generated some large amount of data and wrote it to a file. Being much smarter than I am, his first program worked the first time.<p>But it ran terribly slow. Baffled, he showed it to his friend, who exclaimed why are you, in a loop, opening the file, appending one character, and closing the file? That&#x27;s going to run incredibly slowly. Instead, open the file, write all the data, then close it!<p>The reply was &quot;the manual didn&#x27;t say anything about that or how to do I&#x2F;O efficiently.&quot;\n\n  I firmly believe that teaching how to idiomatically do both character and line oriented file IO should be the first thing any language tutorial teaches, almost. Just as soon as you’ve introduced enough syntax.\n\n    FWIW, the Epitech cursus starts your very first C programming lesson by making you write a &quot;my_putchar&quot; function that does a &quot;write&quot; syscall with a single character. Then you spend the next few days learning how to create my_putnbr, my_putstr, etc, using that single building block.<p>I think that&#x27;s the right choice, by the way. Baby developers don&#x27;t need to learn efficient I&#x2F;O, they need to learn how you make the pile of sand do smart things.<p>And if you&#x27;ve spent weeks doing I&#x2F;O one syscall per character, getting to the point you write hundreds of lines that way, the moment some classmate shows you that you can 100x your program&#x27;s performance by batching I&#x2F;O gets burned in your memory forever, in a way &quot;I&#x27;m doing it because the manual said so&quot; doesn&#x27;t.\n\n      I said idiomatic because that’s the form they’re going to encounter it in the wild, in library doc, in stack overflow answers.<p>I do t think rhe sort of low level bit banging you propose is a worthwhile use of a students time, given the vast amount they have to learn that won’t be immediately obsolete.\n\n        I firmly disagree with this. We&#x27;re talking about learning C, not learning an arbitrary programming language. The course of study the GP comment suggests teaches syscalls, pipes, buffering, and most important, it teaches mechanical sympathy. All of which are things a C programmer needs to understand.<p>More programming tasks than you might imagine are low-level bit banging, and C remains the language of choice for doing them. It might be Zig one day, and if so, the same sort of deep-end dive into low-level detail will remain a good way to approach such a language.<p>Far from becoming &quot;rapidly obsolete&quot;, learning in this style will prevent this sort of mistake for years into the future: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39766130\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39766130</a>\n\n          “we” are certainly not talking about C. I never mentioned C, nor any language. This was intentional.\n\n      This is similar to the presentation in <i>Software Tools</i>, IIRC.\n\n    I would argue that they should be teaching how file IO works at a low level at some point (preferably as one of the first &quot;complicated&quot; bits).<p>Everybody should, at some early point, interact with basic file descriptors and see how they map to syscalls.  Preferably including building their own character and line oriented abstractions on top of that, so they can see how they work.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that IO is in the same category as parallelism; most devs understand it poorly at best, and the ones who do understand it are worth their weight in gold.\n\n      I do not think the typical language tutorial is well served by trying to teach a condensed version of all of CS.\n\n        I don&#x27;t think they need to teach all of CS; I would agree your average language tutorial probably doesn&#x27;t need a chapter on tree traversal or transitive closures or whatever.<p>I do think they should all teach IO, though.  If I could only pick 1 part of a language to understand really, really well it would be IO.<p>The vast majority of apps spend the vast majority of their productive time on IO.  Your average CRUD app is almost entirely IO.  The user sends IO to the app, the app send IO to the database, the database does IO to get the results and then the IO propagates back up.  The only part that isn&#x27;t basically pure IO is transforming and marshalling the DB records into API responses.<p>If you you add parallelism, that&#x27;s like 98% of what most apps do.  Parallel IO dominates most apps.\n\n      I beat benchmark after benchmark in 80s on disk I&#x2F;O. I was amazed that nobody else figured out what my compiler was doing - using a 16K buffer for the floppy drive rather than 512 bytes.\n\n        Heh, wasn&#x27;t 16k most of the memory in the machine? Large buffers do have other interesting and fun side effects, though back then you probably didn&#x27;t have any threads or any&#x2F;many of the things buffers cause these days.\n\n          Most people had 640K of memory.\n\n    The FORTRAN-10 manual was not a tutorial, it was a specification.\n\nIf you want create something like the pipe behaviour the author expected (buffer all output before sending to the next command), the sponge command from moreutils can help.\n\n&gt; By adding a benchmarking script to my continuous integration and archiving the results, it was easy for me to identify when my measurements changed.<p>This assumes CI runs on the same machine with same hardware every time, but most CI doesn’t do that.\n\n  And that the hardware is not overbooked. I found that my ci&#x2F;cd runs would vary between 8 and 14 minutes (for a specific task in the pipeline, no cache involved) between reruns.<p>And it seemed correlated to time of day. So pretty sure they had some contention there.<p>Edit: and that was with all the same cpu’s reported to the os atleast\n\nThere seems to be a small misunderstanding on the behavior of pipes here. All the commands in a bash pipeline do start at the same time, but output goes into the pipeline buffer whenever the writing process writes it. There is no specific point where the &quot;output from jobA is ready&quot;.<p>The author&#x27;s example code, &quot;<i>jobA starts, sleeps for three seconds, prints to stdout, sleeps for two more seconds, then exits</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>jobB starts, waits for input on stdin, then prints everything it can read from stdin until stdin closes</i>&quot; is measuring 5 seconds not because the input to jobB is not ready until jobA terminates but because jobB is waiting for the pipe to close which doesn&#x27;t happen until jobA ends. That explains the timing of the output:<p><pre><code>    $ .&#x2F;jobA | .&#x2F;jobB\n    09:11:53.326 jobA is starting\n    09:11:53.326 jobB is starting\n    09:11:53.328 jobB is waiting on input\n    09:11:56.330 jobB read &#x27;result of jobA is...&#x27; from input\n    09:11:58.331 jobA is terminating\n    09:11:58.331 jobB read &#x27;42&#x27; from input\n    09:11:58.333 jobB is done reading input\n    09:11:58.335 jobB is terminating\n</code></pre>\nThe bottom line is that it&#x27;s important to actually measure what you want to measure.\n\n  Author here.<p>Thanks for reading!<p>&gt;<i>All the commands in a bash pipeline do start at the same time, but output goes into the pipeline buffer whenever the writing process writes it. There is no specific point where the &quot;output from jobA is ready&quot;.</i><p>Right, I didn&#x27;t mean to give the impression that there&#x27;s a time at which all input from jobA is ready at once. But there is a time when jobB can start reading stdin, and there&#x27;s a time when jobA closes the handle to its stdout.<p>The reason I split jobA&#x27;s output into two commands is to show that jobB starts reading 3 seconds after the command begins, and jobB finishes reading 2 seconds after reading the first output from jobA.\n\nThis post is another example of why I like zig so much.  It seems to get people talking about performance in a way which helps them learn how things work below today’s heavily abstracted veneer"

Impressive work.\n\nLooking at the result (figure 4), the model looks more like a good classifier than an image retriever, the generated images have the same subject as the original but are very different, even the colors of the subjects.\n\n  Exactly. The whole image generation bit, at this stage, is noise. But you could easily describe what someone is looking at. Even that is very interesting. And perhaps this will scale up to get high quality, accurate, outputs.\n\nWhy does anyone think this type of scientific inquiry should be pursued at all.\n\n  Same reason we study and do research in biology and fields in general. Understanding more about biology, whether in neuroscience or elsewhere, is the fundamental backbone of medicine. Do you want to live in a world where we <i>don&#x27;t</i> pursue scientific research into things because they seem scary to you? Does it not concern you us building AI smarter than humans, while knowing little to nothing about our own brains? Before we start fading in relevance, we ought to understand how our own bodies (and minds) work! So in fact I think the exact opposite. We should be doing much more work in understanding our own biology (as long as it&#x27;s ethical).\n\n    I’d be fine living in a world where nobody bothered to invent non-consensual mind reading tech. Or, if that’s too much to ask, where we invent everything else that needs inventing first.\n\n      It&#x27;s not more dangerous than non-consensual body killing tech.\n\n        Not sure about that.\n\n  I definitely believe that this technology will get misused. But I expect the researchers are thinking of helpful medical applications. Perhaps to aid people with locked-in syndrome?<p>Edit: More interestingly, it would be amazing if this could show us someone’s perception rather than what they’re looking at. That would be tremendously useful to therapists.\n\n  Cause it has huge medical implications?\n\nIt&#x27;s remarkable that this works, and it&#x27;s equally remarkable that the authors succeeded using a (deliberately) naive approach with the fMRI data.  I was just teaching the visual system to students over the last few weeks: cognitive neuroscience&#x2F;neuropsychology can tell us a lot about what brain systems should be involved here.  It&#x27;s such a tempting research domain to dive into using a more sophisticated approach, but then again, maybe the authors&#x27; simpler data-driven method is a strength.\n\nThis is insane! If capture latency is reduced, can this be used to visualize dreams?\n\nFrom the article,<p>&gt; The present work demonstrates that it is now practical for patients to undergo a single MRI scanning session and produce enough data to perform high-quality reconstructions of their visual perception.<p>&gt; Such image reconstructions from brain activity are expected to be systematically distorted due to factors including mental state, neurological conditions, etc.<p>&gt; This could potentially enable novel clinical diagnosis and assessment approaches, including applications for improved locked-in (pseudocoma) patient communication (Monti et al., 2010) and brain-computer interfaces if adapted to real-time analysis (Wallace et al., 2022) or non-fMRI neu-roimaging modalities.<p>&gt; As technology continues to improve, we note it is important that brain data be carefully protected and companies collecting such data be transparent with their use.\n\nVery cool work. Can something similar be done for audio?\n\n  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;science&#x2F;music-brain-pink-floyd.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;science&#x2F;music-brain-pink-...</a>\n\nSo here is a question:  what would happen if this process faced a person who was specifically hostile to it?  Could you &quot;trick&quot; the process by intensely thinking of, for instance, a yellow ball while viewing a cat picture, as one example?\n\n  I assume the two would be discernible from each other in your brain data to a sufficiently advanced AI. One is your visual stream and one is your visual imagination. On top of that would be signatures of intention to deceive, which are also detectable in theory :)\n\n    All your brainwaves are belong to us.\n\n  From the article:<p>&gt; fMRI is extremely sensitive to movement and requires subjects to comply with the task: decoding is easily resisted by slightly moving one’s head or thinking about unrelated information (Tang et al., 2023)\n\n    So maybe that&#x27;s why magicians are so good at illusion: as we think about what we expect to see, we don&#x27;t process information of our eyes correctly...\n\nI hope someone will do a similar experiment with visualization (imagination) only. Some people are better at this than others so maybe focus on those people who easily create vivid images in their mind&#x27;s eye.<p>Or maybe text.\n\nAs someone with damage to my visual cortex with a very specific effect I’m very curious what this would come up with for me. Not something useful on its own, but more understanding means more possibilities for treatments.\n\n  aphantasia?\n\n    In discussions about neurological diversity and the potential for treatments or adaptations, recognizing and respecting individual experiences while avoiding overgeneralization is key. Conversations around aphantasia, brain injuries, and visual processing offer opportunities for learning and exploration but should be navigated with care to ensure they are inclusive and sensitive to all involved.<p>Aphantasia is the term attributed to the inability to <i>willfully</i> create internal visual objects in the mind that can be perceived consciously. So, that leaves an open unconscious &quot;will&quot; still being able to create them. Studies, and personal experience, shows people considered to have this &quot;condition&quot; called Aphantasia, are able to see hypnogogic images during transition to sleep. And most of us have dreams too.<p>Drawing a conclusion of that term applied to someone who clearly states they have damage to a certain part of their brain and then correlating that an estimated 1-2% of the population is a bit of an insensitive thing, maybe.<p>Then again, I saw a lot of this while exploring the topic a few years back, so it&#x27;s understandable that people who visualize think it&#x27;s some sort of &quot;problem&quot; instead of a super power (which it is).\n\nWhat about doing the opposite: get an image and stimulate the brain to perceive it ?\n\n  For that you’ll need a first class airline ticket with Tom Hardy and Leo.\n\nWhile decoding dreams, as some here suggested, would certainly be an intriguing venue of research, I believe, decoding the minds eye of people who lack the minds eye would be an even more interesting topic. How accurate are their &quot;view&quot;, for a lack of a better word? Would there even be an image to capture?\n\n  It&#x27;s an interesting set of questions to explore. Having thought about this for many years now (since Blake Ross&#x27; post on Aphantasia) my hypothesis is that there wouldn&#x27;t be any decoding because there is no attention on a visual based internal mind object. As a comparative, if we could decode audio from a person&#x27;s mind and then you took someone who didn&#x27;t do echoic recall, then you would expect to &quot;hear&quot; static. The percentage of the population who doesn&#x27;t do echoic recall is, in some references, estimated to be about 60%.\n\nvery exciting tech. also very scary, if we imagine how authority can misuse this."

It doesn&#x27;t seem as far away as it used to.\n\n  There&#x27;s one a year before that one that is also in the continental US, although only near the end. Totality on the centerline in the US ranges from 1m 39s to 1m 47s.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theskylive.com&#x2F;solar-eclipse?id=2044-08-23\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theskylive.com&#x2F;solar-eclipse?id=2044-08-23</a>\n\n    Might be a good excuse to go to Montana though.  But on this one you&#x27;d have to be careful to pick out a location that has a clear view of the western horizon.\n\n  Yeah, I had no idea it was so far away.<p>That makes the ~60% chance of clouds in the Northeast in April that much sadder...\n\nPlaces to stay are booked solid along the route. I&#x27;ve also seen reports of reservations made months in advance getting cancelled when the hosts discover they could get more money. Traffic tends to be epically bad on eclipse days, so keep that in mind too when planning.\n\n  I live in a city nearly directly under the middle of that route. Schools are cancelled for the day, and were known cancelled at the start of the school year. Everything is booked and has been for a while. It&#x27;s crazy. I&#x27;m glad to live near a park that&#x27;s got some events planned but doesn&#x27;t require me to go far or past a lot of people to get there.\n\n  It looks like there are a few major airports in the path of totality, including at least one very close to the centerline (CLE in Cleveland, Ohio). Maybe just fly in, watch it from the airport, and fly home?\n\n    I mentioned this a while back[0] but you really want to be in a rural area when it happens. Most important thing is being in totality, but if you&#x27;re going to go all the way to totality, go rural.<p>When the sky goes dark, and the world suddenly cools, and the birds and insects suddenly wake up and come to life all around you... you&#x27;ll know you did it right. It&#x27;s magic.<p>I&#x27;ll be at a YMCA camp that&#x27;s hosting a family weekend of summer camp style events. Win win.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39468875\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39468875</a>\n\n    I&#x27;ve heard of people planning on doing this at DFW (which is not all that close to the centerline).  I also know a guy who&#x27;s flying up from Atlanta to Indianapolis, I think just for the day, although he plans to leave the airport.<p>Flights are much more expensive than normal, though.  But as that would be the only expense maybe it&#x27;s not crazy?\n\n  I’m grateful to be ~30 minutes away from totality. But I’m still shooting to spend the extra 2-3 hours driving to a place typically only an hour away just because it affords opportunities after the eclipse to entertain us while the traffic leaving the destination can taper out. On the previous eclipse, it took us about 3 hours to drive 20 miles, after the event. I’m not making that mistake again.\n\n    Yes, it&#x27;s better to stay put for quite a while, the roads and highways will be stupidly full as almost everyone rushes to leave the moment totality is over. Then party through the night after the eclipse, share with others what struck you the most.\n\n  If they&#x27;re not booked they&#x27;re exorbitantly expensive.  I&#x27;ve seen one optimistic soul listing an unremarkable house in rural Arkansas for $7000&#x2F;night: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airbnb.com&#x2F;rooms&#x2F;905741949079877847?check_in=2024-04-07&amp;check_out=2024-04-09&amp;guests=1&amp;adults=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airbnb.com&#x2F;rooms&#x2F;905741949079877847?check_in=202...</a>\n\n  We made a reservation months ago, and it was cancelled because the owner could triple the price for someone else. They didn’t even ask if we’d pay more (we would have).\n\nhere’s a map for just North America that includes weather forecasts <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncsu.maps.arcgis.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;webappviewer&#x2F;index.html?id=a65a18758b264f1790665a68b858b3d6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncsu.maps.arcgis.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;webappviewer&#x2F;index.html?id...</a>\n\n  Thanks. I don&#x27;t quite trust it this far out, but where I&#x27;m going is around 50% chance of being clear. If it&#x27;s supposed to be cloudy, I plan on driving toward clearer spots that morning, so this gives me an idea of which way I should go (matches what I had expected, which is to go south toward Texas.)\n\n  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a forecast (eclipse is still 20 days away) but rather it&#x27;s a count of how many days of each type of cloud condition that area has had in the past on this date.\n\n    Using historical averages is a valid way to forecast things so long as you understand that you&#x27;re just getting a rough probability distribution.\n\n      I mean sure, but when people think &quot;weather forecast&quot; they usually think &quot;forecast based on current&#x2F;recent conditions&quot; not &quot;forecast based on conditions at least one year prior&quot;.\n\n    That actually makes me feel better about the data, vs. had it been an attempt to use other models to predict that actual weather, that would have pretty much zero trust in this far out.\n\nI like <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xjubier.free.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;site_pages&#x2F;solar_eclipses&#x2F;TSE_2024_GoogleMapFull.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xjubier.free.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;site_pages&#x2F;solar_eclipses&#x2F;TSE_2024...</a>, you can click on any location and get the exact times for everything.\n\n  +1 for this link - lets you easily click around to see what different places will experience.  In my case, at home the (total) eclipse will last ~2:37, but at my office it&#x27;ll last ~3:41.\n\n  I like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;celestialprogramming.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;SolarEclipseViewer&#x2F;viewer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;celestialprogramming.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;SolarEclipseViewer&#x2F;vie...</a> .  Well, mainly because I wrote it.  But I think you&#x27;ll find it has a few features others don&#x27;t,  which might make you like it less or more.\n\n    I really like this. There is a lot of great information here. It is similar to but different from the others linked in this thread.<p>I really liked the cultural information included - roads, several overlays to help orient things, eclipse duration lines, etc but the thing I liked the most was the rich data about the part of the path that includes my family&#x27;s original land here in Texas. It turns out that both sides of my family settled land that is very near the totality centerline of the eclipse with a duration exceeding 4 minutes.<p>Your addition of layers that define boundaries for parks helped me locate an archaeological site that I had never heard about. While access is not available to the public I was able to research it and read the description of excavations and conclusions about the history of the site. That really made my day since it connected some of the things my Dad mentioned about the area where he was raised with a real historical site very close to the places he described.<p>Too bad we don&#x27;t own either of those parcels today. I am probably going to experience the eclipse with a sister who lives a few seconds outside the 4 minute line since my own home is at a 99.7% eclipse location.\n\n      The credit for the actual map data goes to OpenStreetMap and ArcGIS.  I did the overlay for the eclipse information.\n\n        Great work. I thought it looked like OpenStreetMap underneath. The totality information overlays fit perfectly into their clean display format and the center bulls-eye tracking really allows you to find an optimum place nearest your location to view this eclipse.\n\n  That&#x27;s pretty good, I am considering going to Spain in 2026 and this helps with planning.\n\nSing along with me...<p>&quot;Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun&quot;\n\nWe plan on being in low-population SW TX (somewhat NW of the path), and the evening before we&#x27;ll evaluate and pick an optimal sunny location to view totality; we&#x27;ll have hours to drive a bit South or a bit East to get to the right location by dawn at the latest. Anybody else making similar plans?\n\nI&#x27;m just barely in the eclipse track. Will recommend friends and family go a bit north of mom&#x27;s place to hit the sweet spot."

I&#x27;ve been there a couple times in the last few years, and it just seemed like every other big western city. (except for the police walking around with assault weapons.)\n\n  This is hard for me to imagine. Where in Paris were you? Which big western cities specifically do you feel like it resembled?\n\n    Sorry my communication skills aren’t great. It was a genuine question. I spent a total of 14 days there, but I’m an adventurous walker and covered much of the city. My expectations were too high, probably. (Too high expectations lead to disappointment)\n\n      There&#x27;s even a name for this specific case of disappointment:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_syndrome</a><p>&quot;the disorder is caused by positive representations of the city in popular culture, which leads to immense disappointment as the reality of experiencing the city is very different from expectations: tourists are confronted with an overcrowded and littered city ... and a less than welcoming attitude by French hospitality workers like shopkeepers, restaurant and hotel personnel without considering the higher safety risks to which tourists used to safer cities are suddenly exposed.&quot;\n\n  I think like every city it has good parts and bad parts. Food is great, lots of stuff to do, employment is ok, the city is generally superb. But the population is irascible, the metro is a dark, overcrowded, grafiti covered, piss-stinking place, and the city is one gigantic traffic jam. Health and education is cheap, though state-run schools are in free fall and parents rush to put their kids in private schools. And the city is surrounded with poor neighbourhoods that are a ticking timebomb (with regular riots that are now spreading inside Paris).\n\n  I&#x27;m surprised, to me it always looks &amp; feels very different than most other Western cities, in part due to low-rise buildings and almost exclusively independently operated restaurants and shops.<p>Most other large European cities allowed for high rises and chain coffee shops &amp; restaurants, to the point where they&#x27;ve started to become indistinguishable from one another.\n\n    Paris has the CBD called La Défense which looked like most cities to me. Apparently tourists and residents alike hate it.<p>The rest of Paris is pretty &quot;European city&quot; and maybe I&#x27;m not tuned into the differences, but it seemed quite like Munich, Rome, or Barcelona except for the language, etc.\n\n      For me the size of the core of Paris what make it different. It&#x27;s still comparatively small, but you can walk for hours through streets with shops and restaurants. In other European cities I feel like I hit much faster the suburbs.\n\n  &gt; except for the police walking around with assault weapons<p>So you&#x27;ve never been to North America. Where is it you&#x27;re comparing Paris to, such that it seems like every other big western city?\n\n    I&#x27;ve been to most major American cities, and Toronto, and D.F., as well as Paris and Brussels.<p>What Paris and Brussels have in common with D.F., which they do not share with either the major American cities or Toronto, is police open-carrying machine guns.\n\n      I assume by &quot;machine guns&quot; you mean rifles, and by &quot;open carrying&quot; you mean &quot;carrying.&quot; (there&#x27;s no way to carry a rifle concealed) I have no idea what &quot;D.F.&quot; is.<p>Another response above mentioned that American cops generally keep the long gun in the car. Since today we&#x27;ve got National Guardsmen with rifles in the NY subways acting as police, this conversation all feels a little tone deaf, but it&#x27;s fair enough to point out that French law enforcement do like their rifles. I noticed that the first time I used a French airport, though, not out in the street. I don&#x27;t remember ever seeing police walking in Paris, although I admit that I was a pretty sheltered tourist there.<p>(I bet there&#x27;s a more nuanced conversation to be had here about the difference between police and gendarmerie and I just don&#x27;t know enough about it, except I sort of wonder what the OP was doing that caused him to cross paths with heavily armed law enforcement outside of the airport or government buildings. Maybe Paris really <i>has</i> changed.)\n\n        &gt; <i>I assume by &quot;machine guns&quot; you mean rifles</i><p>I mean both fully-automatic rifles and submachine guns, but sure, I never saw someone lugging around an M2 like a 1980s action character.<p>&gt; <i>and by &quot;open carrying&quot; you mean &quot;carrying.&quot;</i><p>I mainly meant to contrast it with having one easily accessible in their squad car, actually. American police do have long rifles, although these are mostly semiauto.<p>Since there is no way to carry a rifle concealed, all carry is in fact open carry... or is it? Is a rifle in a case open carry? It is not. The term means something in the U.S., and I was using it correctly. In places where citizens have the right to open carry, this applies to a slung rifle as well, in places where they do not, it&#x27;s legal to carry a rifle, but it must be in a case.<p>&gt; <i>I have no idea what &quot;D.F.&quot; is.</i><p>Distrito Federal, Ciudad de México. Had you been a bit more curious, the answer is very easy to determine: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=D.F+city\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=D.F+city</a><p>This is no stranger than referring to New York City as NYC, it is an utterly commonplace term for the city, the one which Mexicans normally use in referring to it.<p>&gt; <i>Since today we&#x27;ve got National Guardsmen with rifles in the NY subways acting as police, this conversation all feels a little tone deaf</i><p>That may be the case, I&#x27;ve been to New York many times but not for many years now. If I had seen this, I would have mentioned it.<p>I don&#x27;t see what about this conversation is tone deaf, other than perhaps your refusal to read what I said with reasonable generosity, or look up a common term for the largest city in North America when you didn&#x27;t recognize it.<p>&gt; <i>I noticed that the first time I used a French airport, though, not out in the street.</i><p>They do tend to cluster around airports and train stations in both Paris and Brussels, although not exclusively. In D.F. you&#x27;ll see machine guns open carried pretty much anywhere, true throughout Mexico in fact.\n\n        DF is an abbreviation of Distrito Federal, a name for Mexico City. It was changed officially in 2016 to just Ciudad de Mexico&#x2F;CDMX.\n\n          Thanks!\n\n    Having lived in america my whole life and been to many different major cities I can say that the police keep their long guns in the car generally.\n\n      In the United States the AR or shotgun will generally be kept in the car. It&#x27;s fairly common to see automatic weapons in Mexico, depending on where you are.<p>(I don&#x27;t remember how the Canadian police typically do things. I think I was dazzled by how attractive the police officers in Canada are compared to the United States, particularly in Montreal, but they definitely carry pistols and wear kevlar...)\n\n        I havent really spent much time in mexico but in my experience cops in canada also generally keep long guns in the car.\n\n          Thanks. It&#x27;s not too surprising that Canada would do things similarly to the US, perhaps sans some of the over-the-top use of surplus military equipment and with fewer donuts.<p>By all accounts, heavily armed security (and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not just sworn law enforcement officers, but also private security) in tourist areas are a bigger thing in Mexico than elsewhere in North America.\n\nThe problem with charging below market prices for anything is that it necessarily leads to a mismatch of supply and demand. So the question is how do you allocate that supply?<p>One way is to have hidden costs. This could range from straight up bribes, to paid consultants  to fill out a lot of forms or talk to the right people, to just knowing someone<p>Another way is a lottery which benefits a tiny percentage of people. Sure it&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot; but the incentive to rig it is huge<p>But even with a lottery it&#x27;s still inefficient. If you give someone an apartment with a market rent of 4k for only 1k you&#x27;re effectively giving them a 3k apartment subsidy. But if you handed them 3k, maybe they would spend 1k dollars on extra apartment and 2k for something else.<p>There are other distortions. Overall these are the worst kinds of policies because it&#x27;s all hidden costs. If we realized that with a system like this we&#x27;re giving 1 out of 1k eligible people the equivalent of a 30k a year transfer, we&#x27;d likely realize it&#x27;s a ridiculous policy. But instead we just say how nice it is so and so is paying only 600 Euros to live in the center of Paris\n\n  I used to think like you but no longer do. A city NEEDS to have people of all ages, backgrounds, income levels etc in it to not die. Yes those people who live in that most central subsidized housing are in some ways winning a lottery ticket, and the real policy is to build <i>a lot</i> more housing as close to the city as possible. But Paris are doing that! AND adding new public transit etc etc. This multifaceted approach is better than just sterile economista policy. Vienna does it very successfully as well. Almost no one owns their home there, they&#x27;re all renting very cheaply very high quality beautiful homes, including inside and very close to the city.\n\n    Ok,think of the politician you dislike the most. Now imagine the discretion of &quot;people of all ages backgrounds income levels etc&quot; would fall to his or her purview to decide. Would you still support the system?<p>We should have a clear objective system of governance that allows even terrible people to oversee it\n\n      &gt; Now imagine the discretion of &quot;people of all ages backgrounds income levels etc&quot; would fall to his or her purview to decide.<p>How much room for discretion is there actually in promoting diversity? I suppose you could forcibly break up poorer immigrant communities which would be pretty harmful.\n\n        It&#x27;s simple, there are laws in the US that state that you cannot discriminate based on sex, religion, nationality, race, etc. if you would want to allow certain programs to help certain groups based on those characteristics you would have to lift those laws.<p>Do you favor removing those laws?\n\n          Oh this is one of <i>those</i> conversations; I&#x27;m leaving\n\n    Why does everybody need to concentrate in huge cities?<p>If Romans where able to relatively evenly spread their towns and population all over the place in the analogue age, then why aren&#x27;t we able to do so in the digital age?\n\n      Rome may not have invented the apartment block (<i>insula</i>) but they sure were fond of their high density residential&#x2F;commercial space...<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Insula_(building)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Insula_(building)</a>\n\n      While being &quot;huge&quot;, good European cities are quite homogenous throughout most of the area with 4-6 floor apartment buildings, small businesses in almost every building, parks, schools, good public transport system. \nThey don&#x27;t feel exactly &quot;huge&quot;.\n\n      Because ~90% of the population was farming\n\n      Did Romans enjoy walking to the coffee shop or the grocery store?\n\n      The principles would be the same even if we concentrated on small cities. A city must promote social diversity to grow the quality of social interaction (even indirect interactions, like walking through a neighborhood built by different ideas and in different styles).\n\n    What do you mean cities need it not to die? Would you say Monaco is dead? What about Zurich? Oslo?\n\n      Don&#x27;t those all have a reputation of being rather dull and culturally insignificant in comparison to Paris?\n\n        Are you suggesting there&#x27;s a strong correlation between the number of low-salary workers living in the city and the presence of the Louvre or the Centre Pompidou?\n\n          Are you suggesting that nothing of cultural significance has happened in Paris since the Louvre opened as a museum in 1793? Or that Paris&#x27;s culture can be reduced to a set of buildings?<p>Also, mixed income housing in Paris has a long history: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Paris#The_Haussmann_building\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Pa...</a>\n\n            &gt;<i>Are you suggesting that nothing of cultural significance has happened in Paris since the Louvre opened as a museum in 1793?</i><p>No; I&#x27;m not suggesting anything of the sort. In fact, that seems like a fairly strange statement given that I mentioned the Centre Pompidou (opened in the 1970s) in practically the same breath.<p>&gt;<i>Or that Paris&#x27;s culture can be reduced to a set of buildings?</i><p>No; again, not sure where that&#x27;s coming from.<p>My point, which you didn&#x27;t address at all, was that you seemed to be implying that there was some kind of correlation between lower-income housing in cities and their cultural significance. Was that your goal? If so, can you explain further?\n\n              In a sentence: artists are poor. Hence the correlation. You can see this on a smaller scale with neighbourhoods in a given city. The culturally cutting edge neighbourhoods of NYC aren&#x27;t the ones where all the rich people live.\n\n      Monaco, absolutely yes, because most of the workers commute from France, they don&#x27;t live in Monaco.<p>Zurich and Oslo, I don&#x27;t see the connection, they both have workers of all kinds, old and young people. They&#x27;re organic and alive cities.\n\n        Monaco is artificially restricted from growing, how can you build a factory there if the state border can&#x27;t be moved?\n\n        Who cares if most of the people working there drive in from France?<p>The point in Monaco farthest from France is like a 10 minute drive away.\n\n          If the workers don&#x27;t live in the city, how can they be considered part of its lifeblood? All of their cultural pursuits happen elsewhere.\n\n            Well, they don&#x27;t live there, but they spend probably 10 hours&#x2F;day there, or 60% of their waking hours. Where someone sleeps doesn&#x27;t seem too important.\n\n              I would say what a person does with their life outside of their working hours is rather important actually, particularly when we&#x27;re talking about the life and culture of a city.\n\n      Isn&#x27;t it practically the same in Oslo, with rent control?<p>And I don&#x27;t know about Zurich, but Monaco is clearly dying. Luckily they can build on the sea (and do so), but it suffered greatly from covid and Russia invasion of Ukraine, as without the Russian mob, a lot of &#x27;amenities&#x27; aren&#x27;t as available, which slow the 35yo+ fratboy life.\n\n      I don&#x27;t get it either. Cities were dying for decades until people with money decided to move back into them and then they began to thrive. In fact, the actual data shows that as a city becomes more expensive it becomes more desirable and attracts more people and the city begins to grow. Places that were once considered off limits become spaces that are coveted. It&#x27;s a flywheel that brings more and more prosperity. The best way to ruin that is to introduce masses of poor people to these areas. We did this in the starting in the late 1950&#x27;s and the cities began to empty out because of the crime that came with it.<p>As the poor constituency builds greater numbers they attract politicians that promise them things by stealing from those with money. This in turn chases those people away and the city is left poorer and poorer and becomes worse and worse. Once nice areas become undesirable and decay sets in.\n\n    Interesting, so to put this in market terms, the city is allowing the value that such people add to it to be offset against the cost of their rent. This would mean that cities like Paris choosing to do this is entirely rational and GP&#x27;s calculation fails to reach this conclusion because it ignores the actual trade that is being made in these cases?<p>Or to make a clichéd example: being cool and arty isn&#x27;t particularly rewarded by salaries because there are a limited number of opportunities for this to improve a company&#x27;s profitability. But it can be rewarded by subsidised rents because people prefer to live in cities with a population of cool and arty people for the non-monetary benefits they bring to that society.\n\n      &gt; But it can be rewarded by subsidised rents because people prefer to live in cities with a population of cool and arty people for the non-monetary benefits they bring to that society.<p>Well, some people do. But everyone is paying for it, even if they&#x27;d rather save.\n\n        If the value your espousing is, &quot;No one should ever pay to have others live better than them off a livelihood that they don&#x27;t support,&quot; a great portion of the remainder of America&#x27;s middle class gets Thanos snapped. A lot of the decently-paying jobs in services, tech, etc. that these communities rely on essentially make the world a worse place, but they&#x27;re profitable, and people gotta eat.\n\n          &gt; A lot of the decently-paying jobs in services, tech, etc. that these communities rely on essentially make the world a worse place, but they&#x27;re profitable, and people gotta eat.<p>If those jobs are paid for by voluntary customers, then that&#x27;s fine. If they&#x27;re subsidised through taxes of people who don&#x27;t want them, that&#x27;s the issue I&#x27;m mentioning.\n\n            &gt;If those jobs are paid for by voluntary customers<p>&gt;If they&#x27;re subsidised through taxes of people who don&#x27;t want them<p>Yes.\n\n              If they&#x27;re subsidised, they&#x27;re not paid for by voluntary customers.\n\n                False dichotomy. Labor can be funded by multiple sources at the same time.\n\n            there is no job on this planet that isn&#x27;t subsidized by taxes<p>how do people show up to work at Google, Apple etc?<p>through everything from &quot;not dying from preventably disease in adolescence&quot; to &quot;being educated in public schools&quot; to &quot;being carried to work on roads and transit paid for by the public&quot;\n\n              &gt; there is no job on this planet that isn&#x27;t subsidized by taxes<p>As in if I am a private plumber who does jobs for people, my job is subsidised by taxes?\n\n                Yes. Who do you think laid the infrastructure for people to get water and sewers in the first place?\n\n                  That depends on the city. If it was originally a company town, probably the company. If it&#x27;s a new build, probably the property developer. But either way, something that already exists is not subsidising the plumber&#x27;s salary. The plumber is paid by the customer.\n\n                    Anything built post-GD (which is going to be the vast majority of what you service) was likely touched by government subsidy in some fashion, whether grants, loans, or municipal bonds (tax-exempt, so effectively a subsidy). &quot;Company towns&quot; built before then were often subsidized, in effect, by companies not having to bear the financial burden of their many, many instances of illegal or rights-infringing behavior.<p>That&#x27;s not considering your customers, who are likely also subsidized by the government in some fashion - if their jobs do not involve federal or state government contracts or supplying or servicing companies holding such contracts, they&#x27;re almost certainly taking advantage of advantageous tax rebates or deductions.\n\n                      You could equally say that tax money is all private money, so really it&#x27;s all private. It&#x27;s silly to talk about the provenance of money in these topics.\n\n                        You absolutely cannot. That&#x27;s the entire point.\n\n        I guess ideally people who live in the city pay for such subsidies through various municipal taxes. People who do not value this policy and choose to live in a different city that aligns with their values would not pay for it. Everybody gets what they want.\n\n          &gt; People who do not value this policy and choose to live in a different city that aligns with their values would not pay for it. Everybody gets what they want<p>Well, not necessarily. People stay for jobs, family and friends. They will just pay for something they&#x27;re not bothered about if it&#x27;s not so expensive they&#x27;re forced to move. That doesn&#x27;t mean them staying is anything to do with the thing some people want.\n\n          I live in Southern Europe. A lot of the people I talk to (about half I would guesstimate) would rather live somewhere else but can&#x27;t. Some would even prefer to move to a cheaper place but can&#x27;t (work, elders, kids, mortgages, are some of the reason).\n\n        I mean, OK, you could say the same about literally every public expenditure?<p>I&#x27;m passionately opposed to private automobiles and the fact that my tax money goes to subsidizing them (including stupid road upkeep etc)<p>unfortunately I don&#x27;t get to choose not to pay for that (but I can choose to live in a place like Paris where the Mayor is taking active steps to support not only private automobiles but give equal importance to other modes of transport)\n\n          If you want emergency services vehicles to be able to access and help at any location, you want roads. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re paying for.\n\n            Yeah because you ardent motorists care so much about emergency vehicle access right?<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with roads, I have a problem with roads being gridlocked and destroyed by single occupancy private automobiles and the resulting unnecessary deaths and road upkeep.\n\n              &gt; Yeah because you ardent motorists<p>You need to be able to speak without classifying people into groups. I&#x27;m not an ardent motorist. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good to allow myself to be indoctrinated into any of the (frankly bizarre) transportation-obsessed groups that exist.\n\n    &gt; A city NEEDS to have people of all ages, backgrounds, income levels etc in it to not die.<p>Correct. Therefore, subsidized housing is good and more of it is better? No, it does not follow.<p>What you say is correct, to a degree. Beyond that, it is incorrect. There are no solutions, only trade-offs.\n\n      If you agree the city dies without people of all ages backgrounds and income levels what is your alternative proposal to subsidized housing. It&#x27;s just a fact that some income levels are being priced out of the city and certain occupations may become entirely unavailable without some mechanism of solving that gap.\n\n        Either you willingly misunderstood my comment, or you are so absolutist in your thinking that you&#x27;re incapable of understanding the concept of a limiting principle in social policy.\n\n          Whoa whoa, dude. You&#x27;re being unnecessarily hostile. GP&#x27;s question was a fair one, and not (by my reading) unkindly phrased. Even if I&#x27;m wrong about that, personal attacks aren&#x27;t welcome contributions: flag and move on.\n\n            Being strawmanned in the most mundane and cliched of ways is deserving of opprobrium. HN is better than that. It&#x27;s tiresome.\n\n        Building more types of housing.  It&#x27;s simple - allow people to build, allow denser construction, allow smaller apartments, etc.  Hell most of NYC would not be allowed to be built today because the apartments are too small -- yet these are the most desirable areas...\n\n    In general, I&#x27;m against govt interventions like this, but in the case of housing, I agree with you. For a society to function in a healthy way, it can&#x27;t be divided in social class &quot;gettos&quot;. It is the responsibility of the State to spend public funds to avoid that. This is not about fairness and equality. It&#x27;s about the long term survival of a society.\n\n      Even further: extremely affordable technology now exists such that the leaders of our &quot;democracies&quot; could ask the public&#x27;s opinions on such matters in a wide variety of fine-grained ways, or even better: facilitate a high quality moderated public conversation <i>that actually involves the public</i> on these and other matters. This may even be a requirement for a healthy society.<p>Unfortunately, current <i>styles of</i> &quot;democracy&quot; not only do not do this, they instead engage in deceptive propaganda <i>to make it appear like</i> they do this and more (how you can tell: observe how people praise &quot;democracy&quot;, based on clearly silly memes).  I often wonder if the quality of these institutions <i>in an absolute sense</i> (as opposed to a <i>relative</i> comparison to <i>literal fascist dictatorships</i>, the only other option dontchaknow) may have something to do with some people thinking they should be eliminated and replaced, a sentiment which is <i>always and without exception</i> represented as being dumb&#x2F;etc.<p>Note also that these institutions also control school curriculum, which &quot;denies&quot; the public the skills  needed to realize any of this is going on, how utterly riddled with error and deceit&#x2F;delusion the public conversation is, etc.\n\n        &gt; ask the public&#x27;s opinions on such matters<p>this would be a disaster<p>take how Hidalgo is deprioritizing private automobiles on the streets of Paris<p>most of the public was passionately and intensely opposed to that, but she did it anyway<p>now, people can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to how it was before - families being able to walk and ride bikes along the Seine and Rue de Rivoli is too nice<p>= asking for peoples opinion on stuff in lots of cases is just going to result in locking in status quo because people don&#x27;t really know what they want, but they&#x27;re usually pro status quo and opposed to change\n\n          &gt; this would be a disaster<p>It depends how you do it.  For example, if you ask their opinion and then carry out that opinion without thinking about it, it would probably not yield optimum results, because humans almost always hallucinate (our culture teaches them this behavior).  But with patient guidance I believe it is possible for people to improve over time.<p>As it is, we are at the mercy of bureaucrats with questionable ethics and goals, <i>who also also always hallucinate</i> (again, because of culture), so this is not a fantastic position to insist on maintaining either.<p>It has been well demonstrated that under very specific conditions, humans can achieve a state of high coherence. We&#x27;ve only managed this in a few select domains so far, because of hard work and counter-cultural attention to detail, and mainly: <i>because a few individuals thought it seemed like a good idea, and made it happen against the odds</i>.  I personally think we can make it happen again, but not if no one tries.<p>&gt; now, people can&#x27;t imagine<p>Not quite. In fact, people <i>cannot stop</i> imagining, the problem is that they do not have control over it, or realize they are doing it. But we are in luck: we have children and teenagers, who have yet to fall victim to the hypnosis&#x2F;Maya that has spread throughout the adult world. They could teach adults how to do it in a controlled manner, as we could in the past, or ideally even better (children and teenagers have never had enough say in decisions if you ask me, they are waaaaaaaay better than adults at specific forms and domains of thinking).<p>&gt; asking for peoples opinion on stuff in lots of cases is just going to...<p>Do you still believe this?\n\n        Local democracies on housing questions are extremely consistent the world over: no more people near me. If there absolutely must be more people near me, they better be exactly like me.\n\n          exactly! nimbyism is human nature, the irony is that no one appreciate they themselves are the person others don&#x27;t want around, lollll<p>if people are given the choice of anything, the answer most of the time will be &quot;no&quot;\n\n            Massive quantities of evidence exist demonstrating that human   beings have <i>at least some</i> capacity to believe that they have concern for the well  being of other humans.<p>Prime example: do you remember that big pandemic a few years ago? Do you remember how passionate most people were that everyone should go get their vaccinations, to protect each other? I sincerely think that these people <i>genuinely</i> believed that the feelings they were experiencing were sincere, and human belief <i>even if non-genuine</i> is an incredibly powerful force, maybe even the most powerful of all forces.\n\n              The charitable impulse in municipal housing politics gets you a cluster of tiny trailer homes on a parking lot surrounded by a 8 foot fence in an industrial part of town far away. Maybe, if you are feeling especially magnanimous, a servant’s outbuilding in the shadow of your house.<p>It’s not in human nature to give charity that would elevate others to the same or, God forbid, higher status as compared to the benefactor.<p>Wherever a young person, newcomer, or upstart has a reasonable chance of attaining what the incumbents enjoy, you’re probably going to find them taking it through market competition, not having it allocated to them by a vote of the incumbents.\n\n                I totally agree with you. But then, consider how different it would be if:<p>a) we had a political system <i>that was capable of</i> enacting the will of the people<p>b) we had an education system that improved people so they <i>were capable of</i> making more optimal decisions\n\n          I agree.  But then on the other hand, there is a wide variety of ways that can be brought to bear to &quot;encourage&quot; humans to change their minds.<p>Alternatively, we could [1] consider waking up for even a short period of time and put some mental effort into considering whether our <i>most sacred</i> operating system may not actually be what it is advertised (and thus: believed) to be.<p>Is it not rather funny that thousands of incredibly smart programmers, systems analysts, etc <i>are not able to even consider</i> whether the system that controls our lives and well being, not to mention <i>the literal continued existence</i> of many thousands of innocent people throughout the world could maybe be substantially improved?<p>Day after day we engage in the pointing of fingers, funny how the fingers never get pointed at ourselves.<p>[1] Well, I am speaking a bit loosely: the laws of physics in this environment support it, but that does not guarantee that it is completely supported.\n\n    Subsidies always have a cost on public finances.<p>In Paris&#x27; case, the financial situation is bad and getting worse with a debt on track to reach EUR10 billion.<p>So it seems to me that Paris is borrowing like there is no tomorrow. This usually does not end well.\n\n      It entirely depends on how the money is spent. If Paris is making investments that will enable it to substantially grow its tax base, it&#x27;s a good prudent strategy, certainly better than the supposedly more fiscally responsible do-nothing strategy that can just as easily lead to financial ruin as irresponsible drunken-sailor spending.\n\n        &gt; <i>If Paris is making investments that will enable it to substantially grow its tax base</i><p>Obviously, this is not what they are doing, debts growing with quite high tax rises at the same time (&quot;taxe fonciere&quot; [property tax] <i>doubled</i> last year).<p>Paris is often depiected as a great model, especially by liberal foreign media, but the reality is rather different, and I believe that the Mayor&#x27;s approval rating is currently abyssmal...\n\n          Not at all obvious. What is obvious is that returns on many investments, such as vastly improving housing and transportation for city residents, have multi-year lags. Like, obviously when you just spent billions on improving your RER, properly redesigning your streets to not be deadly by design anymore, and buying up housing, you&#x27;ll be in the read that fiscal year.<p>&gt;&quot;taxe fonciere&quot; [property tax] doubled last year<p>My French is rusty, but it was a 50% increase, it was previously the lowest of all cities in France, and it was not raised since 2011[0]. It is also peanuts compared to property taxes in Canada where I live, and especially compared to many parts of the US. Not an apples-to-apples comparison because property taxes pay for different things in different countries (i.e. in Canada provincial taxes pay for schools, in the US it comes out of your municipal property taxes). But still, we&#x27;re not talking about one of the main taxes for an average French citizen, clearly.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actu.fr&#x2F;ile-de-france&#x2F;paris_75056&#x2F;taxe-fonciere-a-paris-anne-hidalgo-annonce-une-augmentation-de-10_55025669.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actu.fr&#x2F;ile-de-france&#x2F;paris_75056&#x2F;taxe-fonciere-a-pa...</a>\n\n            Well, you can insist on looking at things through rose-tinted glasses or notpicking. But the facts I highlighted are inescapable...<p>And I won&#x27;t even get into how ghastly areas around the Eiffel Tower (for instance) have become with crime, beggars, etc everywhere.\n\n              You highlighted no facts, actually. The one fact was off by a factor of 2 and missing all context. What you call &quot;nitpicking&quot; is in fact the process of forming an opinion using facts and context. You could offer valuable insights, presumably being a Parisian, but instead you switch topics to beggars and crime. Oh well.\n\n                Debts ballooning and tax skyrocketing are facts. Everything I wrote are facts except of a small error in number but of course you chose to argue that the tax rise was 50% not 100% like if that made a difference to the point.<p>As I mentioned, rose-tinted glasses can be very strong, especially in people who have no insight but are looking for ideological reinforcement because, frankly, articles about how great Paris is in the NYT only serve that purpose, the readers will not know a thing about the actual situation.\n\n      So I&#x27;ve thought about this before because the city I&#x27;m in has received the same critique. I&#x27;m in a 200-something thousand population city that&#x27;s carrying a billion in debt, so about 5K EUR per inhabitant. Given your numbers that&#x27;s pretty much about the same amount of city debt for each Parisian.<p>Big number scary, but looking at it on a per citizen basis is it really that big, or unreasonable a number? Assuming that this debt has been spent rationally on say infrastructure, social housing policies, QoL upgrades for xyz?<p>Yes, good fiscal policy to keep debt stable or reduce in the long term is necessary, but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem as doom and gloom as people make it out to be.<p>You should see how much debt some countries are in... It&#x27;s an order of magnitude more in the extreme cases.\n\n    Suppose you get a job offer, or your adult child has a newborn, or your aging parent&#x27;s health takes a turn for the worse. Instead of being able to simply move, this instead starts a decade-scale process that has a 1% of chance of allocating you a public housing unit in the end. What does that do for dynamism?<p>People&#x27;s intentions about when and where to move are important. A housing system that removes all individual agency from this question, abdicating everything to a government lottery&#x2F;waiting list system, can meet other desiderata but is clearly losing something important.\n\n  I get these arguments against it and I&#x27;m sympathetic to the reasoning, but the point of public policy is results and the Parisian policy certainly seems to just work better than most US housing policy. SF, Boston, NYC also spend a ridiculous amount of money ostensibly trying to achieve similar outcomes but their approaches just don&#x27;t work.\n\n    Afaik 30% of all new luxury high rises are made low and middle income affordable and rent stabilized. In which ways is the NYC system inefficient? Do you believe that is due to policy, abuse by bad actors or some mixture of the two?\n\n      NYC is wildly unaffordable compared to Paris even accounting for the earnings differences. That is the outcome and the failure, not the presence or absence of some specific policy.<p>I am not saying Paris&#x27; approach is transplantable directly to NYC, but rather that first principle analyses (such as gp&#x27;s commentary) that say that the Paris approach doesn&#x27;t work are flawed. I know these analyses are flawed because one can look at Paris and see that they have achieved their policy objective of Paris being affordable for a wide swath of incomes.<p>Policies should be pursued, adopted, changed etc based on their outcomes above their adherence to abstract models. Models are great but once you have data that a policy has failed you should change that policy and try something else.\n\n    Paris housing works better than SF, Boston, or NYC because it is much denser, not because of public housing. American cities artificially limit density which drives up prices as everyone wants to live in the high demand area that cant densify.\n\n  And yet Vienna is one of the most beautiful, livable cities in the world, with its masses of public housing, while major U.S. cities have homelessness crises and TV shows about house flipping for profit. Perhaps we should stop debating things based on the hokum of Econ 101 textbooks and look at what in the real world has actually worked (e.g. abolishing most forms of zoning, massive investments in public housing, robust public transportation, drastically curbing real estate speculation).\n\n    Vienna has had the luxury of having had relatively little demand for housing for over a century. The population peaked in WWI and still hasn&#x27;t recovered (it was 2.24m in 1916, 2.00m in 2023).\n\n      Manhattan&#x27;s population dropped 25% from its peak in the early 1900s. Pre-war was just a different era, this is more of a function of changing living standards, people live larger, not of contemporary housing dynamics.\n\n      vienna also had a lot of buildings destroyed in the war which increased the demand. population was as low as 1.5 or 1.6m in the late 80s&#x2F;early 90s. it grew back to 2m in just a few decades, and it is going to continue to grow, so i&#x27;d argue that it has recovered quite well.\n\n      Vienna actually had a terrible housing crisis before the Austromarxists of Red Vienna built housing en masse. See this article for example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citymonitor.ai&#x2F;environment&#x2F;housing&#x2F;red-vienna-how-austrias-capital-earned-its-place-in-housing-history\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citymonitor.ai&#x2F;environment&#x2F;housing&#x2F;red-vienna-how-au...</a>\n\n        Right, that makes a lot of sense because the city absolutely exploded during the preceding decades. But having the population stagnate has certainly made it easier for them to catch up than if the population had kept increasing.\n\n    The US also has a per capita GDP 50% higher than Austria ($52,131 vs $76,399). At $52,131 a year per capita GDP, Austria would be neatly in second to last place as the poorest state in the Union, as it would beat Mississippi at $47,190 but be beaten by West Virginia at $53,852. So perhaps the US policy is doing something correctly.\n\n      I look at the numbers and think they demonstrate how much more efficient Austria is compared to any US state. I would prefer living in Austria to Mississippi.\n\n        Less than 5% of households in Austria have air conditioning, vs 93% in Mississippi. Granted it gets hot and humid in Mississippi, but the average summer highs in Austria is a sometimes-muggy ~27C and it will probably get worse with climate change - heat waves up to 40C have already happened. I&#x27;ll take the AC and the other conveniences the Americans have, though it would be nice to have the social atmosphere Austria has too. To a large degree, Austrian efficiency is just getting by with less than an American does.\n\n          European lack of AC is mostly that they historically haven&#x27;t needed it. It&#x27;s not like they can&#x27;t afford ACs. Also, 27C (80° in freedom units) as your normal peak temp is pretty firmly in &quot;why bother with AC&quot; territory.\n\n          I would rather compare education and healthcares since I value those more than A&#x2F;C.\n\n            This is one of those things that are harder to compare. Mississippi, like all of the US, has free public K12 education. The public university system also extends automatic full scholarships for academically qualified (and the qualification is not that high) students, and also admits basically anyone else who is able to pay, though without academic qualifications they will have to take advantage of Pell Grants (free money but not much) and federal student loans. Of course, you could argue about the <i>results</i> of the system, and admitting students who are not going to succeed in college and thereby saddling them with debt in exchange for nothing is a failing of the US system.<p>For health care, there are many publicly owned hospital systems in Mississippi, and of course Medicare is available for everyone 65+. Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, so while Medicaid (free health care) is available for children, pregnant women, and the disabled, there is a coverage gap between that and qualifying for the ACA subsidies for health insurance (aka &quot;Obamacare&quot;) which is sort of similar to the German system if you wave your hands; I think Austria has something similar, but I&#x27;m not familiar, but obviously the coverage is broader.\n\n      A more relevant measure might be median income per capita&#x2F;household, adjusted for purchasing power. On that basis Austria does quite well.<p>Additionally, quality of life amounts to more than measures for disposable income etc. If you consider access to education and healthcare the picture might take on greater depth.\n\n      Oh yes, it’s much better to make 53K a year and live in West Virgina than Vienna. This is a sentiment with which everyone would agree.\n\n        What&#x27;s wrong with West Virginia?<p>If you used housing prices an an indication of desirability (and an attempt to stay on topic) people much prefer to live there than the smallish mid-western town that I bought a house in.<p>I mean, trees and mountains instead of miles and miles of corn...\n\n        To be honest West Virginia is the best US state (I also am close with back to landers communities, and visited through their lenses, so I am biased). Homemade booze (I don&#x27;t drink, but still), homemade goat cheese (best cheese I had in the US), best kayaking rivers, great hiking trails, great people, great horses, great musicians. What&#x27;s not to love.\n\n          The rates of childhood poverty and food insecurity, for starters.\n\n      How is GDP per capita relevant, especially not adjusted for purchasing power parity? For Austria the GDP per capita PPP is at $67-69k depending on the estimate, which would put it somewhere between 27 and 33 place of US states, so roughly in the middle.<p>If you compare the Quality of Life Index, Austria is 9th, USA is 15th. Freedom Index - Austria is 93, USA is 83. HDI USA is 20th with 0.927, Austria is 22nd with 0.926. Another fun one is Cost of Living index which shows that Austria is significantly cheaper to live in compared to the US (66.8 vs 72.9 out of NYC).<p>I can go on, but it&#x27;s frankly ridiculous that you think GDP per capita is relevant, or somehow directly impacts the lives of Austrians and invalidates the good choices Austria and Vienna have made.\n\n        I don&#x27;t think most indices are very valuable - when you drill down into them, you usually find out there&#x27;s a lot of decisions about what that really means made for you by some NGO or think-tank in order to get the desired result. That&#x27;s not to say they still can&#x27;t reflect some underlying true reality about &quot;freedom&quot; or whatever to some degree, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth citing them in a discussion.<p>You&#x27;re quite correct he should have used GDP w&#x2F; PPP, but I don&#x27;t think the fact that Austria would rank merely below-average rather than second-worst is a very powerful argument. And there is some truth to this: visit the average American household and they have a lot of material wealth compared to the average European. I remember being particularly shocked by the state Germans live in and find acceptable.\n\n          &gt; You&#x27;re quite correct he should have used GDP w&#x2F; PPP, but I don&#x27;t think the fact that Austria would rank merely below-average rather than second-worst is a very powerful argument<p>It is, because they were implying that Austria having the social housing policies that it does, it severely impacts GDP; but it doesn&#x27;t. A tiny mountainous country that was twice in the middle of disastrous wars in the last century, has practically no raw materials... and would be in the middle of the US GDP PPP-wise, which has a much bigger market, a lot more workers, a lot of raw materials, etc etc etc etc. And again, this is assuming GDP matters for the average person&#x27;s life... and it doesn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; visit the average American household and they have a lot of material wealth compared to the average European<p>At the expense of crippling debt :) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;hha&#x2F;household-debt.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;hha&#x2F;household-debt.htm</a> (don&#x27;t forget the fact that American savings have to account for losing your job or getting sick, as well as retirement, while in Austria they don&#x27;t).\n\n            &gt; A tiny mountainous country that was twice in the middle of disastrous wars in the last century, has practically no raw materials... and would be in the middle of the US GDP PPP-wise, which has a much bigger market, a lot more workers, a lot of raw materials, etc etc etc etc.<p>Austria got screwed by WWII for sure, but it still had a literate, educated, relatively wealthy population and was once the center of a great empire that amassed great wealth. And, I mean, Vienna was practically the cultural center of Europe for a brief period.<p>&gt; At the expense of crippling debt :) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;hha&#x2F;household-debt.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;hha&#x2F;household-debt.htm</a> (don&#x27;t forget the fact that American savings have to account for losing your job or getting sick, as well as retirement, while in Austria they don&#x27;t).<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to argue that the American safety net needs improvements, but Social Security, (retirement and disability benefits), Medicare (65+ government health insurance), Medicaid (poor, unemployed, and disabled health insurance), and unemployment insurance all exist in the US, and together with other benefit programs constitute the majority of US spending. Indeed, US <i>government</i> spending per capita on health care is higher than many European countries. It&#x27;d be a good example of where having a higher nominal dollar value doesn&#x27;t buy as much even adjusted for PPP, since obviously despite this the US doesn&#x27;t have universal public health care.<p>This is considered uncouth to say, but household debt is <i>sometimes</i> due to horrible exigencies, but it&#x27;s much more often the result of easy access to debt and material consumption. It&#x27;s really shocking to see the people you know cannot be making more than 40-60k driving around 50-70k vehicle, and who also have a nice boat and a huge house. But even people not doing these things tend to live more materially comfortable lives than most Europeans I know.\n\n        I have worked for some time in Austria and I have many friends who are US citizens.<p>While the latter have indeed revenues that seem much higher, I would say that there is no doubt that the quality of life of my former Austrian colleagues was higher, based on purchasing power, balance between job and personal life and quality of food and environment.\n\n        GDP Per capita isn&#x27;t pa particularly good metric, but it is a measure for how productive a country is. So when the original poster laments that Vienna has this model of subsidizing housing while the US needs to &quot;get rid of econ 101 hokum&quot;, I think it does do a good job as showing that for their differences, the US does do a good job at things (creating economically productive value in this case).\n\n      When comparing two developed countries only using GDP&#x2F;per capita, make sure that the person you are debating with is way less educated than you are.\n\n      I think that just goes to show how misleading GDP can be!\n\n      Only an American could make this argument. Vienna tops global comparisons for quality of life all the time. Life expectancy is higher in Austria, as are safety, education standards and all other meaningful indicators.<p>Who cares about some silly numbers on a bank account? We live good lives.\n\n  Basically, you’re assuming that this system is going to be like the underfunded and scarce public housing in the United States where a difficult to win lottery will be necessary to secure an apartment. In that sort of market of scarce supply, slumlords can overcharge for low quality rentals. But they couldn’t do that in a market where the government is offering a real alternative that you can actually get into. From the article it seems like the Parisian government has such a large supply of public housing that it is a serious market force that can influence the rest of the city and the makeup of its neighborhoods.<p>Your description of the situation sounds more like America where a tiny inventory of antiquated public housing units built ~40 years ago (the last time any American politicians cared to lift a finger to address poverty and inequality) are made available by a bleak lottery.<p>Just because the public housing system doesn’t work in America where it’s basically an afterthought doesn’t mean that it isn’t working in other places.\n\n    Not Paris but NYC:<p>&gt; For many New Yorkers, the most desirable jackpot is not the New York Lotto, but to be selected in the city’s extraordinarily competitive affordable-housing lottery. Tens of thousands of people, and sometimes many more, vie for the handful of units available at a time. Since 2013, there have been more than 25 million applications submitted for roughly 40,000 units.<p>Central planning has been tried over and over and has failed and led to more scarcity. It&#x27;s like fitting climate change by regulating thermometers. Maybe this time is different?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;nyc-affordable-housing-lottery.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;nyc-affordable-h...</a>\n\n      Your top comment sounded pretty sensible and fair but in your responses to comments you now just sound like a troll.<p>Central planning works very well: that&#x27;s how every corporation, city, and state works. It works well as long as you apply it to a small enough market and e.g. don&#x27;t try to plan the whole economy.<p>The problem in NYC is that there is not enough affordable housing. 40k units is nothing in the housing supply, and the rent inflation has been way too high lately.\n\n      Yes if you support 40,000 units and your demand is much higher you&#x27;re going to have problems. That tells you the system is underfunded.  Central planning hasn&#x27;t universally failed in every aspect and every application.  Central planning tends to do poorly at solving problems that market mechanisms solve effectively, but it&#x27;s sometimes useful at solving problems that market mechanisms solve poorly.<p>Centrally planned universal healthcare is generally effective and much cheaper than other systems. The US has out of control healthcare costs with its free market system.  The next most expensive country to the US has less than 50% of the administration costs so the free market has actually come up with a bureaucracy that is more expensive to administer than what the government creates.<p>In general, central planning fails when market mechanisms are replaced by using force to allocate something. That doesn&#x27;t mean opt-in programs with voluntary registration are going to experience the same type of failure. We know replacing salaries with a gun and telling people what they have to work on is a bad idea. That doesn&#x27;t mean all central planning ever is a bad idea. I don&#x27;t think anyone seriously argues we should abolish federal, state, city governments and let my local neighborhood manage it&#x27;s own policy but that&#x27;s the logical extreme of all central planning failing.\n\n        Calling the US health care system free market is quite the big stretch.<p>I can honestly not come up with another industry that is subject to higher regulatory burdens. Maybe nuclear power?\n\n          Ah yes, the old libertarian cop-out. The most free market healthcare system in the world is too highly regulated and if we just take the regulations away it will perform better because ideology. This is despite the fact that if you look at healthcare systems in the world most performance metrics improve with more regulation but not less. But lets forget about being data-driven when ideological purity is at stake.\n\n            I don&#x27;t have any real issue with regulations <i>per se</i> but with people claiming that a <i>highly</i> regulated market is &#x27;free market&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m actually quite happy with my socialized health care aside from the last time I went to the emergency room they sent me home to die and when I came back a day later they were rapidly pulling out faulty body parts before I did indeed die. Well, then there&#x27;s the Phoenix VA death list scandal.<p>I know I shouldn&#x27;t complain as it not like I risked life and limb in service of my country and earned it as a direct result of military service or anything.\n\n              My issue is less with what we call the individual markets in the experiment. It&#x27;s more with looking at healthcare across a large data set of countries and finding a general trend that more regulations lead to better cost structures and better health outcomes for the population and then somehow jumping to the conclusion we need no regulation for everything to work. That&#x27;s just inconsistent with empirical reality and it&#x27;s one of these purely ideological fantasy-land claims.\n\n                I would very much like to see a study from a credible source who came to this conclusion based on a survey of different health care systems.<p>What I believe is more likely is people looking at the <i>kind</i> of regulations being used and concluding that the correlation between good and bad regulations can be directly tied to the profit motives behind said regulations. A purely state run health care system has zero incentive to impose regulations that seek to raise costs and hurt competitors because, by definition, there is no completion. A purely private health care system has a lot of incentive to regulate the amount of doctors (to keep wages high) or make reporting costs extremely high to push out the smaller hospitals and increase their market share &amp;etc.<p>I suspect that reality falls somewhere in the middle no matter what system you look at and everyone wants to argue from the extremes (or accuse someone else as being an extremist as you so helpfully demonstrated) so there is no real dialog for trying to fix anything.\n\n            &gt; healthcare systems in the world most performance metrics improve with more regulation but not less<p>This claim is almost always because american lifetime expectancies are bad. But thats because Americans are unhealthy, not because our healthcare is bad. Do you have a different reason to make this claim?\n\n              “Americans are unhealthy” is an outcome of a bad healthcare system, not an excuse for it.\n\n                No. It is the outcome of a culture that values individualism to a toxic level and has accepted decisions that make your life shorter as normal. Really very little to do with healthcare at all. Americans dont value their lifespan like others do but apparently that means our healthcare is bad? Like there are plenty of things to complain about with our healthcare why choose something that isnt even true.\n\n                I have 100% government provided healthcare (aside from dental) and I won&#x27;t go see a doctor unless I&#x27;m literally going to die or want them to pull cancer off my arm. My diet would probably horrify you. Healthy as a horse except for another bit of suspected skin cancer I need to get checked out.\n\n      The failure is not so much in central planning as it is in human cognition, across the board in every single person involved, operationally or in observance.<p>If we do not try to not fail, then we should not be surprised when we always fail.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;WLJwTJ7uGPA5Qphbp&#x2F;trying-to-try\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;WLJwTJ7uGPA5Qphbp&#x2F;trying-to-...</a>\n\n  &gt; So the question is how do you allocate that supply?<p>To adress this specific question for Paris, they put an upper limit on your income to rent specific housing with lower rent.<p>I&#x27;ll scale down your caricature of an example though, the offers you can see are usually 15% to 20% under market price, not 75% like you seem to imply.<p>Not exactly sure what is your point otherwise, the difference in terms of giving someone an apartment with a lower market rent vs. giving that money outright will eventually lead to the same thing, except that the former is also a way to curb the very high rent inflation (among other things), and results <i>in both cases</i> in a significant increase in purchasing power, at a given income.<p>&gt; If we realized that with a system like this we&#x27;re giving 1 out of 1k eligible people the equivalent of a 30k a year transfer<p>This is not equivalent because giving someone that money doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll chose to live inside Paris, and this is a measure that goes beyond financial support. It&#x27;s also a city policy aimed at achieving a specific population distribution.\n\n    &gt; This is not equivalent because giving someone that money doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll chose to live inside Paris, and this is a measure that goes beyond financial support.It&#x27;s also a city policy aimed at achieving a specific population distribution.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I would prefer the autonomy to choose where I live and how I spend my money. Why don&#x27;t we afford the same respect to people that are less well off? Why do we want to essentially force them to live somewhere expensive when they would prefer to use that money elsewhere? They&#x27;re not some pawn you can use to feel good about yourself. &quot;Oh look at all these people from different cultures that live here&quot;. They&#x27;re human beings\n\n      I think it&#x27;s totally fair that a program designed to support people of a certain income living in Paris requires those people to live in Paris.  If you want autonomy you can have it, just don&#x27;t take the money&#x2F;apartment. This feels like a cake and eat it to attitude.  Government is totally allowed to have aims and reasons behind programs. Having low income people live in Paris ensures there are people available who can do work that can&#x27;t afford to pay high wages. This is important to having a vibrant city and something reasonable for a government to aim for.  If people could just take the money and screw off to anywhere in the country, then we&#x27;d effectively see people take a $30,000&#x2F;year subsidy and go somewhere they could live entirely on that without working, which would accomplish very much the opposite of what the whole program was trying to do.\n\n      This doesn&#x27;t force anyone&#x27;s hand. If people don&#x27;t want to live in Paris, that&#x27;s their choice. No one is kidnapping them and shoving them in these apartments.<p>On the other hand, if they want to, they have an avenue to do this (and it&#x27;s still going to be difficult, supply isn&#x27;t nearly as plenty as the private market), even if they don&#x27;t have the income needed to find housing in the same area otherwise.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re not some pawn you can use to feel good about yourself<p>That&#x27;s not the reason Paris is doing this. There are benefits to encouraging diversity, among which fighting against getthoisation&#x2F;communitarianism and prejudices, things that France has quite a poor records with in the last 50 years, and that had direct consequences on society cohesion.\n\n        Let&#x27;s not use euphemisms. You&#x27;re encouraging a certain racial and identity makeup of a city. It&#x27;s literally the same policies that led to ghettoization. I don&#x27;t want (often unelected) bureaucrats to put their finger on the scale on who can live in an area. It&#x27;s not wrong because it was used to exclude [group] from certain areas, it&#x27;s wrong on principle. And if we allow that power to the state, there&#x27;s no reason it won&#x27;t be used by someone with ideals that don&#x27;t align with yours\n\n          First things first, we&#x27;re talking about income-based public housing attribution. Not racial. Although if policies in the past means ethnic minorities have been disadvantaged all other things considered, then that will overlap, but as a consequence, not by design.<p>Secondly, Paris&#x27; policies are decided by the mayor of Paris and the city council, and they&#x27;re elected (mayor directly, city council semi-directly). Not by &quot;unelected bureaucrats&quot;.<p>Then your comment makes no sense. Policies favoring social diversity are the exact same policies that led to getthoisation? Do we agree on what getthoisation means? Because those two things are exclusive.<p>You say you don&#x27;t want bureaucrats to put their finger on the scale of who can live in an area, that&#x27;s your opinion. But if you&#x27;re saying this should be purely left to supply and demand, then somewhat it <i>is</i> still a (non-)decision to put the finger on the scale, at one extremity, and it will have a certain outcome. Whether this outcome is good or bad will be a matter of opinion in certain cases, but not in others, e.g. what impact this has on the local economy for example, whether this leads to a more or less appeased society, and so on.\n\n      &gt; Why don&#x27;t we afford the same respect to people that are less well off?<p>This has to be facetious. They&#x27;re perfectly free to go live in the country or move to Italy. I&#x27;ve never seen a desirable apartment I couldn&#x27;t afford and then thought to myself how much I&#x27;m being respected by not being able to live there.<p>And with regard to the last point, no one is suggesting this as a means to have some peasant zoo in the city, a city needs a labor force. If you price out everyone who isn&#x27;t a dev or a financier then you&#x27;re not going to have a lot of the things that make a city nice. To some degree this is a subsidy for employers, because otherwise they&#x27;d need to pay more for their employees to afford living nearby.\n\n    &gt; To adress this specific question for Paris, they put an upper limit on your income to rent specific housing with lower rent.<p>Why would you ever want to incentive people to not earn more money? Stay poor and we&#x27;ll give you a house - sounds like a bribe.\n\n  Market prices rarely (almost never) consider externalities - situations like this where it is a societal decision, it is difficult to define what we want, much less define a objective function that the market prices can optimize on.<p>Case in point - congestion pricing<p>I prefer excess housing &#x2F; school &#x2F; living infra which is subsidized by the society\n\n  Allocating public housing could be done through an auction system. Bidders would submit offers for annual rent. The surplus, after deducting costs, could then be allocated to buying or building additional housing for this program. Alternatively, it could be used directly to subsidize rent for low-income individuals.<p>In the end, this would solve the allocation problem while maximizing the available public housing. It would take a couple of years or decades to reach an equilibrium state I guess.<p>I&#x27;m probably missing something obvious here. Can somebody point out my mistake?\n\n    You&#x27;ve literally described a market system.<p>A developer charges as much as they can for their rental units. If profitable they take that surplus and build new units up until the point that the marginal cost of providing an apartment is equal to the marginal revenue for renting such a unit. This isn&#x27;t due to benevolence but how you maximize profit. The developer also pays taxes which pays for public services<p>So yes, I am in favor of this system.\n\n      The problem with this so called &#x27;market system&#x27; is it allows people to chose their neighbors through bidding only on properties they know the poors can&#x27;t afford.<p>If the French wanted citizens to have the freedom of (dis)association they would have written it into their constitution.\n\n  It doesn’t take much to destroy a city with money, I can see it happen in a few cities in Europe now. Foreign money, mostly from non EU countries like Russia keeps pouring in raising the market value until no local can afford renting or owning an apartment anymore. Look at places like Sylt or some nicer towns in Switzerland or France, they basically got overrun by rich a••holes buying everything they could. Boggles my mind why people think it’s fair that local families compete with shady millionaires for living space.\n\n    Local families are the ones getting rich by having their houses surge in price. And they are probably also the reason why new houses are not being built.\n\n      Assuming they aren&#x27;t renting.\n\n  If the goal is to have a diverse economic mix of people to live in a city center, then let the results speak for themselves. If another city has the same goal and can achieve a better result with less resources then that’s worth considering.<p>The “they haven’t thought this through all the way” mantra you’ve espoused might be true. Also maybe you’ve not thought it all the way through. Maybe that has been tried and doesn’t work well for reasons. For example if you increase the flow of money into a market without increasing supply, prices tend to rise and the wealthier will absorb the rise better than the poorer. As you’ve helpfully pointed out, there are knock-on effects, however those effects don’t just apply to one side.<p>So that’s why I advocate for aligning and judging success on the goal and comparing like to like.\n\n  When someone rents a small apartment in the center of Paris for 4k on the private market in all likeliness they&#x27;re paying more than 3k of pure rent profit to the owner.<p>The rent can be levied by the owner however the owner actually did not provide any of the investment or labor required to give the apartment the value it has. The apartment has value not because of anything inside the apartment or the building. It has value due to its location, something that the owner has no control over and did not spend a single penny to make more attractive.<p>This is obviously a huge inefficiency in the economy. Why should someone profit from the attractiveness of a location they haven&#x27;t actually built? This is a positive externality.<p>Part of the solution of our huge housing crisis across most developed cities is obviously that there should just be more housing. This would bring prices down overall. However, new construction is extremely difficult, and that is due the in part to lobbies of wealthy owners which seek to keep prices high by maintaining scarcity.<p>Turning private rent housing into public housing is a good way to eliminate the economic inefficiency of rent in that one case and it also drives the price of nearby housing down too, as the private market has to compete with the public offering.\n\n    &gt; It has value due to its location, something that the owner has no control over and did not spend a single penny to make more attractive<p>To be fair, the owner is paying property taxes - which do go towards improving the location.<p>&gt; The apartment has value not because of anything inside the apartment or the building.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find, in basically any city, that the quality of a building does correlate to it&#x27;s rent price or value. You&#x27;ll also find that owners do invest in increasing the quality of their buildings, which does improve the value or &quot;niceness&quot; of the location. If this wasn&#x27;t true, gentrification couldn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; Why should someone profit from the attractiveness of a location they haven&#x27;t actually built?<p>If you&#x27;re claiming that since no real identifiable person or group &quot;built&quot; the attractiveness of a location, and that therefore no one should get to profit from it, you&#x27;d be seriously tampering with the signal that the natural markets supply&#x2F;demand provides in the form of rental prices. That&#x27;s going to lead to some significant &quot;economic inefficiencies&quot; for the area in the medium to long term.\n\n    You&#x27;ve left out a few things the landlord does and the risks they assume (at least here in the USA, I&#x27;m not sure about Paris):<p><pre><code>   - mortgage costs\n   - property taxes\n   - insurance\n   - utilities\n   - repairs\n   - maintenance\n   - savings for large future capital outlays (new roof, furnace, etc)\n   - renters not paying\n   - empty rental units\n   - loss of investment opportunities of the capital locked up in the building\n   - possible loss of all income due to fire, etc\n   - 34 other things I&#x27;ll leave out\n</code></pre>\nIt may look like landlords have it easy but as a former commercial landlord I can tell you it is not easy at all.\n\n      Landlords (in the USA at least) are wildly subsidizing renters, because they&#x27;re so hungry for the appreciation benefits.<p>You can test this anywhere the rental prices are below about 1% of the purchase price.\n\n<i>&quot;A city, if it’s only made up of poor people, is a disaster,&quot; said Mr. Apparu, who now works for a property developer. &quot;And if it’s only made up of rich people, it’s not much better.&quot;</i><p>From a human+social position, I strongly agree with this. The value of social benevolence isn&#x27;t limited to the direct beneficiaries and has positive impacts beyond the economics.\n\n  But that literally never happens, each city contains both rich and poor people.\n\n    Strictly sure but the quote more addresses the experience that visitors, residents and prospective residents have.\n\n  it&#x27;s not benevolence, it also makes economic sense. who does the menial job anyway? you should keep them close. if they will go to live far, their cost will increase, or their cost in time of traffic and pollution.\n\nThe Mayor of Paris has bigger balls any other Mayor except maybe Barcelona<p>...and they&#x27;re both women! The confidence to make radical, meaningful changes for the better of the people and tell the opposition to get stuffed... I wish all politicians had that.\n\n  &gt; I wish all politicians had that.<p>Even the politicians you disagree with? So for example, AfD in Germany making the radical, meaningful change for the better of the German people by removing non-Germans from Germany ... and telling you to get stuffed ... you&#x27;d love that presumably?<p>What you love is this policy. Don&#x27;t confuse that with the method, which you clearly wouldn&#x27;t like if the shoe was on the other foot.\n\n    Either I missed the part where the article mentioned the policy in paris being unconstitutional or that equivalence is overly-exaggerated at best\n\n  it&#x27;s mostly continuing the policies from the previous mayor... (who was male, but I don&#x27;t see the relation).\n\nNY is a mess of policy failure and rampant corruption in the implementation of these policies, policies which have for decades been championed by the NY Times, frequently by naive portrayals of policies in Western European countries like this one. Once imported at 5 times the cost and half the quality these become irrevocable subsidies for well connected landlords and administrators. The city needs to get basic things like sewage, security, and transit working before plowing any more money into subsidized housing.\n\n  &gt; security<p>Oh come on, the NYPD swallowed 5 billion in public funds, the most of any city on earth. Crime is near an all-time low. Hell, they could probably slash half that budget without causing the crime sprees the NY post implies could happen at any time. This is the worst excuse to avoid funding subsidized housing when the latter would probably have a greater impact on whether people were desperate enough to turn to crime. Saying NY needs to be more secure is just fear mongering at this point.\n\n    This is simply not true.<p>&gt; they could probably slash half that budget without causing the crime sprees<p>You&#x27;re living in a world painted by your politics and oblivious to reality. I plan to return to the city someday if things improve, but things are horrible now and not moving in the right direction.\n\n      &gt; but things are horrible now and not moving in the right direction.<p>Nobody ever backs shit like this up. You&#x27;ve been had and in the most obvious and shallow manner.\n\n&gt; <i>One quarter of residents in the French capital now live in government-owned housing, part of an aggressive effort to keep lower-income Parisians — and their businesses — in the city.</i><p>I think they meant <i>&quot;...and their votes&quot;</i>\n\n  expand?\n\n    The article mentions a woman who wept with joy when she received a &quot;steal&quot; of a lease for a new government owned building, and the article mentions that certain political parties have made this program a priority.  Perhaps this woman will support such political parties with her vote in future elections.\n\n    The socialists who control the city have a majority but not a structural one (Paris was voting conservative for a long time). The gentrification of Paris would normally deplete their electorate, so you can see their efforts to buy prime real estate at high price to convert it to social housing as a very expensive vote-buying exercise.\n\n      Or perhaps they try to do what socialists are supposed to be doing, namely giving the people a place where they can live.\n\n    Not the same guy, but if a class of people have to move out of the city because they are being priced-out, they will not vote in this city anymore (but in their new city in the suburb), shifting the current political balance.\nThe current Paris mayor is from the Parti Socialiste (left-wing &#x2F; moderate left-wing - for France), and may get a lot of their vote from the working class people living in Parisian social housing. Therefor, they have an active interest in keeping them within the city.<p>The political theory is true but I have no idea if the people living in social housing do vote more for the current mayor though. So it is just theory.\n\n    They&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s done as an electoral bribe so that the people who benefit from this policy will vote for the party who did it\n\n  People always say this like a gotcha, but aren’t politicians <i>supposed</i> to do stuff that they think people will vote for?\n\n    there are laws against giving financial incentives to voters... but they have been long forgotten\n\n    No, I want my politicians to declare what they want to do, and then I choose which one I agree with. I do not want them to get elected, then try to do what people want. That&#x27;s backwards.\n\n      Haven&#x27;t they advocated for public housing and people voted them because of it?\n\n    Only if it is good for the country, otherwise it is at best demagogy, at worst corruption. And in this case borderline with gerrymandering (not by pushing constituency limits but by engineering a change in demographics).\n\n      Since when is encouraging people to be priced out “good for the country”?\n\n    Politicians aren&#x27;t supposed to manipulate the voters set by moving people around by decree.<p>That said, city planning is a complex thing so there&#x27;s no easy answer to whether they are doing this.\n\n    &gt; aren’t politicians supposed to do stuff that they think people will vote for?<p>This is generally true, but there is a line beyond which this becomes problematic.<p>Surely you wouldn&#x27;t support explicit vote buying, where a politician promised to repay voters with public cash after the election! If such a scheme were permitted, democracy would quickly cease to become a marketplace for ideas. It would devolve into a patronage system. Most of us would immediately recognize such a scheme as dangerous and question the legitimacy of any so-called democratic government whose majority was bought in such a manner. Do you agree that this would be a problem?<p>Why would this cease to be a problem if the kickbacks were paid in-kind, and only made available to the poor?\n\nThis article reminded me of a thought I’ve often had: that the USA is a great place to live for the upper middle class and above, but it’s one of the worst wealthy countries to live in when you’re poor.<p>From the context of the USA it seems downright amazing to see a society where public housing isn’t automatically assumed to be a number of bad things: taxpayer waste, crime haven, and antiquated disrepair.<p>The benefits of the tenant management system also seems like it’s good for everyone in society. Our daily surroundings really shouldn’t be a race to the highest bidder for high-rent tenants like McDonald’s to come in, underpay employees, and poison local residents with junk food. The approach to the city as a public landlord being selective and building a neighborhood through balancing available goods and services seems incredibly desirable.<p>In the US this is all inverted the wrong way: the wealthy neighborhoods are the only ones that can keep chains like McDonald’s and Walmart out, walkability and positive urban fabric is a luxury amenity for the few (e.g., NYC, Miami, and Chicago’s best neighborhoods), and the wealthy are the ones that are subsidized instead of those who are low income or middle class.\n\n  &gt;Our daily surroundings really shouldn’t be a race to the highest bidder for high-rent tenants like McDonald’s to come in, underpay employees, and poison local residents with junk food.<p>A good term I heard for this was &quot;strip mine society&quot;.\n\n  I think the big issue is it&#x27;s a lot harder to start social housing in 2024 when you have extremely limited historical action on it.  But in general a city buying real estate is a hedge on real estate prices increasing in that city, which can be extremely useful for city budgets if you have any costs associate with housing some portion of the population.  Most cities of a certain size find they can&#x27;t function without some amount of social housing: the free market prices out entire occupations that cities need.  Even someone as non-essential as a Barista is actually quite important in that many of the people in NYC want to be able to buy coffee.  But you aren&#x27;t going to get Starbucks to pay the $20+ &#x2F;hour needed for them to rent within a reasonable commute of where they live.<p>There are also questions about how much of out of control rents employers are responsible for and should bear the cost of, and how much it is the cities fault.  To the degree to which rental prices are high because of politician supported NIMBYism it seems fairer for city budgets to bear those costs than third parties.\n\n    The other option is to greatly improve transportation where you can live 50 miles outside the city and still get to work in under 30 minutes.<p>This is very hard to do as you need exceptionally fast trains and well developed feeder lines.\n\n  I&#x27;ve often suspected third world countries stay &quot;third world&quot; because being rich in a poor country makes it a great place to live?<p>(just as the second world countries which bordered the first seem to have done better than their ideological cores, it seems to me that first world countries which bordered the second have also done better)\n\n  Poison? More like extremely nutritious and very cheap. Maybe too nutritious. Thanks to modern technology, even the poorest among us can afford to look like King Henry VIII. Would you take that privilege away from them?\n\n  Boutique shops and artisinal fares aren’t what poor immigrants to the USA are looking for. Being poor in the USA already means you’re better off than you’d be in most of those “wealthy countries’” in income. The bottom 10% in the US have a life index on par with or better than the top 10% in most European countries. The lowest 20% in America consume like an average person in a wealthy European country. Meanwhile my cousin is a third generation German and still gets called Ausländer by her teachers (who get to decide for her which academic future she’s allowed to have).<p>Every poor immigrant family I know from around the early 2000s, ourselves included, now _owns_ at least one house. Their kids went to college, people started businesses.<p>Also if you haven’t seen chains in &lt;wealthy European city&gt; pay less attention to McDonald’s and more attention to luxury clothing brands. Trust me, unlike Subways, you won’t be seeing Europe’s poor in any of these places. And for what it’s worth, Paris is swarming with homelessness, including that of small children. The fact you see the opposite written in the New York Times should be a clue that they’ve got a reason to skew that reality otherwise.\n\n    &gt;The bottom 10% in the US have a life index on par with or better than the top 10% in most European countries.<p>Not convinced.\n\n      <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;timworstall&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;astonishing-numbers-americas-poor-still-live-better-than-most-of-the-rest-of-humanity&#x2F;?sh=952279d54ef0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;timworstall&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;astonish...</a><p>Also: Reported by Le Monde covering a study of GDP per Capita:<p>&gt; Italy is just ahead of Mississippi, the poorest of the 50 states, while France is between Idaho and Arkansas, respectively 48th and 49th.

With some exceptions, the city has the legal right to pre-empt the sale of a building, buy the property and convert it to public housing.<p>What are the mechanics of how this works? If I agree to buy a property for a million dollars, does the city get a chance to match that price?\n\n  Yes, that&#x27;s pretty much how it works. The city has the right to become the buyer for the specified price for any property sale.\n\n  &gt; What are the mechanics of how this works? If I agree to buy a property for a million dollars, does the city get a chance to match that price?<p>there&#x27;s a French wiki page on this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Droit_de_pr%C3%A9emption_urbain#R%C3%A9gime_actuel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Droit_de_pr%C3%A9emption_urbai...</a><p>But basically, yes, the city has 2 months to match the price. The city can also offer a lower price, which can be refused (so no sale at all) or can be argued in front of a special judge, who&#x27;d rule if the price offered by the city is acceptable, depending on the local housing market.<p>It&#x27;s not a rule that&#x27;s specific to Paris, but which is applicable in most French cities.\n\n    So does this mean that every sale of any building can take at least two months?\n\n      They always take two months at the very minimum as well because buyers as to go to many banks or a loan broker. You have notaries involved and right to step away from a sale, no question asked for 10 days iirc.\n\n      Not any, only old buildings built after a certain date. And two month to sell a building in France? It&#x27;s fast.\n\n      2 months would be an ultra fast completion in the UK. I think when I bought my house it took 3 months, when I bought some land, cash purchase, it took more like 6 months.\n\n      I&#x27;ve seen the process to purchase a place in both France and California. The former can take the significant part of a year, the later a matter of days.\n\n      From the experience of a few friends who&#x27;ve bought appartments these last years, two months would be the minimum here in France.\n\n  No, pre-empt here means you don&#x27;t have a word, the town (commune) has priority and you can&#x27;t make an offer\n\n  Basically, if your property is eligible for preemption, you have to declare that you intend to sell (at the price you wish) to the city, which can then tell you that<p>- they don&#x27;t intend to buy, in which case you can proceed with the sale<p>- they buy at the price you&#x27;ve set<p>- they make a counter-offer, which you have the right to refuse but then you also renounce to sell<p>If there&#x27;s a dispute on the price (especially in the third case), a tribunal will decide the eventual price, &quot;based on the recent sale prices of similar properties&quot;.\n\n    I tend to lean lefty, but this scheme makes me understand why libertarians want less government<p>How much my home is worth should not be capped by whatever government thinks. That&#x27;s bs<p>If government is counter offering all of my neighbors and they are accepting it, then I am screwed. I either accept the government counter offer or I go to tribunal who will cite all of the government&#x27;s recent purchases from my neighbors to set the price at something very close to that anyways<p>And if I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m legally not allowed to sell?<p>Ridiculous<p>Even if you don&#x27;t think houses should be infinitely appreciating assets, which I don&#x27;t, your asset worth should still be as valuable as someone is willing to pay for them, not controlled by a cartel style government\n\n      Whether you like it or not the government does tell you how much your house is worth through monetary policy.\n\n      &gt; I go to tribunal who will cite all of the government&#x27;s recent purchases from my neighbors<p>That&#x27;s an assumption on your part. Both the owner and the city can mount a legal case as to why their price is the correct one. In practice, this is often done by comparison with other properties in the same area and with the same characteristics. The judge also gets to visit the actual property to have its own perspective on it. Both the owner and the city have access to the same data when it comes to properties sold and bought, and must establish their cases based on concrete notarial deeds.<p>There are indeed cases where the city makes a counter-proposal with a price that is significantly lower than market rates, but you have court rulings that reject these and side with the owner. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect, but it&#x27;s not one-sided like you describe.<p>It can be frustrating, but eventually the city is not just a bunch of houses piled up in a completely decentralized way, and the preemption right, which has exceptions, for example properties recently built cannot be preempted, and which isn&#x27;t automatic, i.e. there are multiple recourses for owners, is there so that the city has some leeway to conduct policy with regards to housing.\n\n        But the market is completely distorted because the government is close to a monopsony. Especially if they &quot;preempt&quot; an entire neighborhood. There&#x27;s no private sales to point the tribunal to in that case so they have utter control over the price\n\n      Should land -- a scare, limited resource -- be a private or public asset? I believe you&#x27;re coming at this from the former perspective. But, it&#x27;s worthwhile to ask this question so that we can understand why it could make sense to give the public a say in how land is allocated and used.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to point out that when you say:<p>&gt; I tend to lean lefty, but this scheme makes me understand why libertarians want less government<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to replace `government` with `a large private company` in your hypothetical:<p>&gt; If ~government~ a large private company is counter offering all of my neighbors and they are accepting it, then I am screwed. I either accept the ~government~ large private company&#x27;s counter offer or ~I go to tribunal who will cite all of the government&#x27;s recent purchases from my neighbors to set the price at something very close to that anyways~<p>With, of course, the downside that there&#x27;s no system-level recourse when the large private company uses its power to either:\n- undercut your &quot;market value&quot; of your home and force you to sell\n- or make living in your home terrible due to it successfully buying up and controlling all of the land _surrounding_ your home<p>Both lead to what you are saying you don&#x27;t like -- some _external_ actor coming in and controlling &quot;how much [your] home is worth.&quot;\n\n        &gt; It&#x27;s quite easy to replace `government` with `a large private company` in your hypothetical:<p>Yeah that&#x27;s kind of my point!<p>This would very obviously be predatory if it were a real estate conglomerate, which is something government should protect people from, not actually just become themselves!!<p>&gt; Should land -- a scare, limited resource -- be a private or public asset? I believe you&#x27;re coming at this from the former perspective<p>This is completely irrelevant to the topic, because in this case we are talking about a situation where land is being treated as a private asset, and a government is acting like a private real estate conglomerate<p>You can challenge it on grounds of what &quot;should&quot; be, but that&#x27;s an entirely different discussion\n\n      This isn&#x27;t some government rug-pull on your idyllic picket-fenced suburban house.  You might find housing to be different in other parts of the world.\n\n      That&#x27;s what libertarians want until it&#x27;s time to use eminent domain to build a freeway so they can exercise their freedoms. Then it&#x27;s fine to cap your property value to something else because you can always prop the goal of progress as very important. But if you want to prop something else, dare I say something left leaning, something they&#x27;re not interested in, then it&#x27;s outrageous.\n\n      &gt; How much my home is worth should not be capped by whatever government thinks<p>What&#x27;s your take on anti-price-gauging laws? Should the government &quot;cap&quot; the price of food and bottled water after a natural disaster, or should the seller determine how much it&#x27;s worth, as determined by supply &amp; demand?\n\n        Now I&#x27;m curious about what&#x27;s <i>your</i> take on them\n\n          I&#x27;m generally <i>not</i> against the existence&#x2F;enforcement of price smoothing laws (over time - as the intention with anti-price-gauging laws, or across the market, with market comparisons). I think it strikes a good balance when bridging the macro to the micro.\n\n      You&#x27;ve misunderstood. You can choose what your sale price is. You may or may not clear the market (find a buyer) at that price. But, if you do, you may have to sell to the government. You choose the price but not the buyer.<p>Paris property remains extremely expensive.\n\n        Based on the parent comment, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve misunderstood<p>&quot;if your property is eligible for preemption, you have to declare that you intend to sell (at the price you wish) to the city, which can then tell you that [list of options here]&quot;<p>It seemed like the city has right of first refusal. If they make a counter offer you are then either obligated to accept their offer, or go to tribunal, or not sell\n\n  It&#x27;s essentially the same as a <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right_of_first_refusal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right_of_first_refusal</a>\n\n  &gt; the city has the legal right to pre-empt the sale of a building, buy the property and convert it to public housing<p>Sounds like every property sale is a political calculation ready for grease.\n\nMy understanding is that excise taxation is generally agreed upon as the preferred method for governments to manipulate the market, both because it incurs fewer deadweight losses and because it tends to actually work better.<p>So, what if we get rid of all these complicated rent control and rent freezes and affordable housing schemes, and instead just implement a rent tax, to be paid by the landlord, and make it progressive? I don&#x27;t know exactly how it should scale; you wouldn&#x27;t want it to be just by rent because that would have a regressive impact on families who have kids, because they need more space and more space naturally costs more. Maybe price per square foot?<p>At least in my city this would probably also reduce real estate prices in general, because a huge source of demand for houses is actually real estate speculators who buy up houses and then put them on the market as rental units. I gather, based on one conversation with an acquaintance who had been a realtor but was looking to pivot into this line of business, is that a lot of what&#x27;s fueling that is, in effect, not-exactly-loopholes in US and local housing, lending and tax laws - many of which are ostensibly aimed at making housing more affordable - that allow people with sufficient resources to financially engineer together a speculative source of income while externalizing all the risk onto everyone but themselves.\n\n  Most demand for houses is from people. Most price increases are due to a lack of supply that exceeds population growth. Most lack of supply is caused by it being illegal to build higher &#x2F; more dense, and a variety of other rules and regulations.<p>Landlords are for the most part capitalizing on these broader market &#x2F; regulatory trends.\n\n    I don&#x27;t understand the downvotes. I honestly think what that is saying is true in a black and white way.<p>Grandparent says:\n&quot;get rid of all these complicated rent control and rent freezes and affordable housing scheme...&quot;<p>I think this is fertile for discussion. Rent freezes didn&#x27;t work in Argentina (extreme example), my opinion is they don&#x27;t work anywhere. But oversupply does reduce prices, as happened with evergrande in China.<p>IMO interest in not  having an oversupply bursting a bubble is precisely what parent is talking about.<p>Again, in a very absolute way of looking at life.\n\n      Compare and contrast with Paraguay where you can build whatever you want whenever and there is an ample supply of housing and very little in rental returns.<p>Argentina is a great example. That said rent is also cheap in Buenos Aires. But I think that is due to the economy rather than rent control.<p>You’re right in that affordable housing in any real sense would be MASSIVELY unpopular with voters. You’d be looking at cutting values in half to reach 2000s levels of affordability or 75% to get to 1970s levels.\n\n        The best that can be done is freezing house prices nominally (or close to it) and then let inflation take over as supply increases.<p>People are really bad at working out constant dollars and have loans, as long as the nominal value is steady or going up slightly, they don&#x27;t really care if the absolute value has dropped because of inflation.\n\n          What mechanisms would be effective at controlling asset prices under inflationary monetary regimes?\n\n    No, price increase is mostly due to inflation trends. When there is an inflation trend the house market follows, for example in London, after the start of the war in Ukraine things like gas and gasoline price went up which created a legit price increase for products that depends on those. But we&#x27;ve also seen an increase in rent. And that&#x27;s because estate agents knew that since there was an inflation trend people were expecting to pay more. So the whole market went up with no significant change in supply and demand.\n\n      You’re wrong and you don’t know what you’re talking about, I don’t mean to be rude but it’s more than just inflation. There is a mismatch between number of people and number of housing starts, it’s been this way for 20 years. Estate agents charge more because people will pay it because anyone who can’t afford it goes homeless or moves somewhere else.<p>In London, where housing delivery has long trailed short of need, the population rose by 3.4 for every new home.<p>This mismatch of housing supply and need has had drastic consequences for affordability. Rents increased 2.0 per cent per year in England on average over the last decade, according to data from Hometrack. Growth ranged from 2.4 per cent per year in London, where housing delivery was lowest relative to population growth. In the North East, by contrast, housebuilding all but kept pace with population growth and rents grew just 0.7 per cent per year.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.savills.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;article&#x2F;309803&#x2F;residential-property&#x2F;housebuilding-2010-2020--population-growth-more-than-double-number-of-new-homes-built.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.savills.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;article&#x2F;309803&#x2F;residential-pr...</a><p>The ratio of house prices to earnings, another basic measure of housing affordability, increased from 6.9 in 2010 to 7.8 in 2019 across England. In the North East, where we delivered almost as many homes as people, homes became more affordable. In London, where housing supply falls far short of need, the ratio of house prices to earnings has ballooned.\n\n        A large part of the price in indeed related to offer vs demand but that&#x27;s the basics for any market.\nNow it&#x27;s funny because you also say &quot;Estate agents charge more because people will pay it because anyone who can’t afford it goes homeless [...]&quot;.  \nSo it isn&#x27;t just offer and demand isn&#x27;t it?<p>When you think about it, even in areas like London the housing market is not liquid nor uniform enough for the offer vs demand model to apply. You don&#x27;t rent&#x2F;buy home like you buy strawberries.<p>In about 1 year there was no significant increase in demand and the supply stayed the same but everybody saw its rent increase.<p>Edit: Also we should not mix-things up, the housing market is very different in outliers like London compared to the more global market. Here we&#x27;re in the context of those outliers (Paris, London, etc.)\n\n    &gt; Most price increases are due to a lack of supply that exceeds population growth.<p>Citation definitely needed.<p>In my opinion, cheap credit (i.e. low interest rates) is the primary culprit. It has created an awful lot of &#x27;artificial demand&#x27; for properties as investments as opposed to demand for properties to be used as homes. In most markets I look at, the proportion of underutilised properties has been rising (second homes, short term rentals, land banking, etc).<p>Here in NZ the sharp rise in interest rates caused a sudden and significant increase in homes available for sale and homes available to rent. Where did they come from?\n\n  People who don&#x27;t understand market pricing are against rent taxes because they think landlords can pass them through.\n\n    And people who don&#x27;t understand supply and demand think rent taxes are a solution to a lack of housing stock.\n\n      Not everyone agrees there&#x27;s a shortage: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;lifeandstyle&#x2F;2024&#x2F;mar&#x2F;19&#x2F;end-of-landlords-surprisingly-simple-solution-to-uk-housing-crisis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;lifeandstyle&#x2F;2024&#x2F;mar&#x2F;19&#x2F;end-of-...</a><p>A few choice paras (if people don&#x27;t read the full article):<p>&quot;The forthcoming general election is once again likely to be dominated by claims about a housing shortage and a dire need to build more homes. Housebuilding is an article of faith across the political spectrum. The evidence, however, does not support this thinking. Quite the reverse. Over the last 25 years, there has not just been a constant surplus of homes per household, but the ratio has been modestly growing while our living situations have been getting so much worse. In London, as the Conservative Home blog notes, there is a terrible housing crisis “even though its population is roughly the same as it was 70 years ago”, when the city was still extensively bomb-damaged by the second world war.&quot;<p>&quot;The supply issue continues to dominate the discourse despite the US having more homes per capita than at any point in its history, and the UK’s homes-per-capita ratio actually exceeds the US’s.&quot;<p>&quot;In terms of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, the UK has roughly the average number of homes per capita: 468 per 1,000 people in 2019. We have a comparable amount of housing to the Netherlands, Hungary or Canada, and our housing stock far exceeds many more affordable places such as Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.&quot;\n\n        That argument presumes that housing is consumed the same way it was 70 years ago, and that the location of the housing is irrelevant.<p>I know lots of places where there are empty, cheap houses. They&#x27;re not close to any good jobs, the only Internet they have is 3G, and the schools suck because the county is poor (because no one wants to live there).<p>I also suspect housing consumption per-capita is up as people move out younger and marry later. Especially in population centers.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re pointing to as the reason for housing prices if it&#x27;s not supply and demand.\n\n          And you either have to make the &quot;cheap places&quot; more desirable (which raises their prices, but lowers pressure elsewhere) or you have to build more housing in the desirable areas.<p>You also have the issue that if someone <i>does</i> have a house, no matter what kind of house, it&#x27;s a hassle and a half to move, so you have to provide some pretty darn strong incentives to get people to move.<p>My house ain&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;d need something like $10-20k to consider moving to a nearly identical or even somewhat better house, just because of the costs and hassle associated with moving.\n\n          I think the main argument they are making is that affordability is less a demand&#x2F;supply issue and more a tax policy issue. Implication being: if you cap rental income, you&#x27;ll see a fall in private landlords but not necessarily less housing stock than if there were no rent controls.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re pointing to as the reason for housing prices if it&#x27;s not supply and demand.<p>They are saying the uncapped rental market makes housing as an asset class extremely profitable i.e. simple supply &amp; demand argument is not strong enough alone to be the only driver.\n\n          &gt;as people move out younger and marry later<p>What data do you have of people moving out younger? Everything I&#x27;ve seen is that younger generations are stuck living at their parent&#x27;s house.\n\n        Housing per capita may not be the best measurement, if households are changing. What may have been two parents and some kids in one house after the war may now be two separate households because of divorce, etc.\n\n    how could&#x2F;would they not?<p>everything is paid by the renters, and if the price is not high enough (to turn a risk-weighted profit) it will be removed from the market.<p>(if there&#x27;s a high enough vacancy tax and&#x2F;or security costs against squatting, then eventually it will be sold. which is a one time boon for the market, but it ends up crowding out new developments for a while, and altogether this just leads to crazy waitlists and the usual discrimination.)\n\n      I don&#x27;t know anything about the French rental homes market but in the USA there&#x27;s ample headroom in lessor profits to take a haircut without triggering the second-order effect that you hypothesized. Landlord income as a share of GDP (again, in the USA) stands at a post-War high, having increased 15x from its low around 1990.<p>Landlords have a huge and largely unearned cashflow and the thing about taxes is it&#x27;s best to try to raise them where the money is.\n\n      Rental supply is fixed in the short term. Therefore landlords have no pricing power unless they are colluding assuming theyre trying to maximize profit and not giving tenants a deal. Landlord goal is to rent every unit for maximum amount, that means renters set the price by competing with each other.\n\n        Kind of the same deal as rent control in a lot of ways, right? What you get is a short-term suppression of market rates that slowly get internalized by the supply-side until prices more&#x2F;less return to the original equilibrium\n\n    &gt; People who don&#x27;t understand market pricing are against rent taxes because they think landlords can pass them through.<p>If all rents are taxed, what is the market mechanism to avoid pass though?<p>It seems as if a more fair approach would be to increase tax rates on income from rents. That way a rentier would not defer maintenance, the costs of which would be deducted from income and not taxed, as opposed to front-loading the tax to the rent transaction and thus encouraging deferred maintenance to preserve income.\n\n      The problem — again, in America — is that residential rents are by far the largest component of unreported income. Exemptions mean nothing to petty criminals who are already not effectively taxed.<p>The market mechanism that precludes tax pass-through is the price is already set as high as the market will bear. If landlords could raise the rent to pass through a new tax then they would have done so already without the tax.\n\n        Where do you find that residential rent is highest unreported income? Last figure from IRS I see is 2014-2016 and rent was a quarter the size of non-farm proprietor: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;pub&#x2F;irs-pdf&#x2F;p1415.pdf#page23\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;pub&#x2F;irs-pdf&#x2F;p1415.pdf#page23</a><p>What percentage of total rents are unreported? One would expect that the majority of rents are collected by professional management companies subject to reporting requirements that make underreporting unfeasible. Maybe that is an incorrect baseline?<p>What makes you think that rents are already as high as the market will bear? After all, rents keep rising, right?\n\n  There are failures of excise taxation to address the problem, in part due to political objections and blocks to taxation in the first place, while there are very long running examples of quality public housing making a competitive check on excess private rents in city markets.\n\n  The problem with taxing rent is you have to ask: do you also tax the &quot;imputed rent&quot; of owner-occupiers?<p>It&#x27;s politically difficult to do so, but if you don&#x27;t you end up with an even bigger barrier to mobility and entry to the property class as you have to pay more until you can save up for a deposit.<p>(I don&#x27;t think you can make the tax incidence on renters zero)\n\n  You&#x27;ve re-invented Land Value Tax, which absolutely 100% should be everywhere.\n\nAs a Parisian, who is generally angry at the city’s housing policy (build taller!), I find the public housing of the past few years to be a great achievement. In general, public housing sits on the outer edges of Paris, but the city has been agressive in reconverting buildings in posher neighborhoods. It doesn’t really lead to reduced rent (because no additional supply), but it decreases social segregation. That alone is critical to keep a city alive.\n\n  &gt;  but it decreases social segregation. That alone is critical to keep a city alive.<p>I agree that is a net boon to society. I think the cross drift of ideas is a net positive, the human interaction can create more opportunities for those that have less, I don&#x27;t think it reduces inequality meaningfully and I&#x27;m not suggesting that was a goal only that my prior statements might lead one to believe it does, but I&#x27;ve seen far more segregated cities be without many services during an infrastructure failure, because the people doing those services didn&#x27;t live there.\n\n  Paris needs a new center. Like many other cities, build more places where people want to flock so you get pressure off the center.<p>Most new developments are in dead areas because nobody wants to spend time surrounded by ugly, bland and functional architecture.\n\n    The problem is, when you are competing with the center of Paris, it is pretty hard to build a compelling alternative. Say what you will about the streets being loud, chaotic and dirty, the area between the II, III, V and VI arrondissements (Latin quarter, Pantheon, Beaubourg, Jardin du Luxembourg, Tuilleries, Notre Dame, Place des Vosges) is still just swell.\n\n      Yeah, and also you have the problem of job location. The regional government says they want to make the Paris area more &quot;polycentric&quot;, but there’s a limit to that if jobs are heavily concentrated in one area. We are racing to open more subway lines, and that will surely help, but at some point, raw distance will remain a bottleneck.\n\n        This reminds of the project that aimed at creating a new business&#x2F;commercial complex south-east of Paris in Noisy-Le-Grand. A real estate promoter had a big project, and a metro line was designed, then built, but the real estate project went into bankruptcy and never got out of the ground.[0]<p>The metro line was completed, inaugurated, but never opened to the public, and eventually mothballed. For quite a while, it was rumored that they operated trains once a month to keep the system working and maintained, not sure up until when.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Noisy-le-Grand_Metro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Noisy-le-Grand_Metro</a>\n\n          The Tim Traveller channel on YouTube did a couple videos about this [1] and [2]. The station was open for a brief time for some public tours before being redeveloped. He also links to some archival footage from 1997 showing it in motion [3].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bWxESIzJhCU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bWxESIzJhCU</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KGIz_zwoALU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KGIz_zwoALU</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yMHW9cEAO78\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yMHW9cEAO78</a>\n\n        It&#x27;s not a problem in the sense that nowadays we know how to make it. It&#x27;s a question of money and political build. More housing, more offices, make it pleasent, connect it, etc.\n\n        Seems like governments could lead the charge by building new government facilities in an alternate location, which is created with a solid plan for incorporating public transport, housing, event spaces, and retail.<p>Its entirely possible to build a new city from the ground up.  And starting with a clean slate allows planners to design with the next 10,20,30,50 years of growth in mind.  It&#x27;s very difficult to scale a city effectively without a long-term city plan.\n\n  Do you live in one of these places?\n\n  &gt; build taller<p>As someone who lives in an area with plenty of high-density residential buildings, I can attest that this is a perfect recipe for creating congested cities with such intense light and noise pollution.\n\n    It can certainly cause light issues, but I&#x27;m not sure why it would cause _congestion_?\n\n      It causes congestion if the city refuses to invest in public transportation - which is more a problem in US cities - though some European cities could be behind on keeping up with changes to different degrees\n\n        Oh, right, I see, yeah. Would not generally be an issue in Paris, I would&#x27;ve thought, at least not towards the centre.\n\n          You&#x27;d be mistaken. Public transit is extremely crowded in the centre during rush hour.<p>For example, two regional lines (RER B and D) need to share a tunnel in the middle of the city. They&#x27;ve been investigating digging another one for a long time, but, AFAIK. they haven&#x27;t found an economical way of doing so. The solution is to try to move people to other lines, but those are already very crowded and I&#x27;m not aware of any project to build a new line inside of the city limits.\n\n        Congestion is a problem even in cities with excellent public transportation. Have you ever been on the Tokyo subway at 8:30 am?\n\n          Yes, it always a balance of factors in the system, but what you&#x27;re talking about is a higher threshold of capacity already.  They&#x27;ve built up to higher rise density in Tokyo and are already managing much higher people movement in core higher density areas than the edges of Paris.\n\n      Ultimately you have more people coming and going from each building, which means more people on the streets, and more demand for all utilities and public services. Building up doesn&#x27;t build out those other things. That&#x27;s why you have things like Air Rights in NYC to limit building.\n\n        People aren&#x27;t very noisy. Cars are\n\n          I don&#x27;t know... I lived in Barcelona for two years recently and had pretty bad luck. In addition to one-off incidents, some consistent noise issues we had:<p>- The Pakistani restaurant below our apartment would regularly host receptions&#x2F;weddings until 2-3am. The sendoff typically involved groups of 20-30 people banging large drums loudly and singing as the happy couple walked out and were driven away.<p>- We had a neighborhood drunk who frequently (multiple times a week) would wander down the street singing Flamenco-style ballads about his unfortunate love life. My assumption was that the ex he was singing to lived on the street? Anyway, he had quite a voice and was great at projecting.<p>- The building behind us was shorter than ours and our rear balcony faced their rooftop. In the summer one of the apartments there would semi-regularly hold parties until 1am.<p>Cars were an occasional issue too, but people were a much bigger problem in that particular neighborhood. That said, I&#x27;ve also lived in dense neighborhoods with none of those problems, so maybe better norms&#x2F;regulations are the answer... but existing noise ordinances in the US are rarely enforced.<p>Beyond the noise issues though I did enjoy the convenience&#x2F;amenities that a dense neighborhood provides!\n\n            recently moved half a mile further out from city center and can attest to all of this.  Hookah bar in my case was blaring music at 1AM.  People in various states of inebriation shouting to each other outside my bedroom window.<p>There&#x27;s less car traffic too but that was such a background noise that I hardly noticed it. Though truthfully the first week or so at the new place I was conscious of it&#x27;s absence.\n\n            Theoretically all those interactions breach the social contract and could be acted upon by making complaints. However, someone loudly driving a multi-ton car down your road is <i>always</i> &quot;okay&quot;.<p>Also... I live in a low-density urban neighborhood currently and it&#x27;s the loudest place I&#x27;ve ever lived. <i>Mostly</i> it&#x27;s road noise, but also one of my neighbors parties 12+ hours every weekend playing music very loudly. Some people are just loud, but cars make <i>everybody</i> loud.\n\n              &gt; However, someone loudly driving a multi-ton car down your road is <i>always</i> &quot;okay&quot;.<p>Cars with fart pipes installed are the same kind of violation. Modern cars with functioning mufflers or electric powertrains... aren&#x27;t actually that loud.\n\n                &gt; Modern cars with functioning mufflers or electric powertrains... aren&#x27;t actually that loud.<p>Until their tires hit asphalt. Cars have to go <i>very</i> slowly for the engine to be louder than the tires, and that noise is a function of weight, and electric cars are heavier than equivalent ICE cars.\n\n                  Most of the sound from a modern car with a functioning muffler is wind noise. You can barely hear the tires unless you&#x27;re standing right next to it.<p>&quot;Electric cars are heavier&quot; is some silly nonsense where people went looking for something to complain about. You can make an electric car as light as you want, with the trade off that it implies making the battery smaller and reducing range. But the Model 3 has a ~300 mile range and weighs the same as the average car.\n\n                    &gt; Most of the sound from a modern car with a functioning muffler is wind noise<p>What? Like wind hitting the extremely aerodynamic surface of the car designed specifically not to catch the wind? I have never heard or read this in my life - it is widely known that tires-on-pavement is the biggest contributor of car noise. That roar you hear standing a quarter mile from a busy highway is not wind, it&#x27;s the tires.<p>&gt; &quot;Electric cars are heavier&quot; is some silly nonsense where people went looking for something to complain about. You can make an electric car as light as you want, with the trade off that it implies making the battery smaller and reducing range.<p>Again, this contradicts everything I&#x27;ve read and&#x2F;or is just willfully ignorant. You can&#x27;t make EVs superlight by stripping down the body, for example. The battery is <i>the</i> heavy part and while they may get more mass-efficient over time EVs are now and for the foreseeable future strictly heavier than same-size ICE cars.<p>EVs aren&#x27;t the savior of the environment, public transit is. EVs are better than ICE cars in most ways, but for noise <i>all</i> cars are a problem and EVs are worse.\n\n                      &gt; What? Like wind hitting the extremely aerodynamic surface of the car designed specifically not to catch the wind?<p>Like the sound of a hundred cubic feet of metal displacing the air at 40 MPH and leaving vacuum in its wake, yeah. That they&#x27;re designed to be aerodynamic is the reason they&#x27;re not that loud.<p>&gt; That roar you hear standing a quarter mile from a busy highway is not wind, it&#x27;s the tires.<p>Now you&#x27;re talking about highways. People don&#x27;t typically drive at highway speeds on city streets.<p>&gt; Again, this contradicts everything I&#x27;ve read and&#x2F;or is just willfully ignorant.<p>People have agendas. They need some reason for electric cars to be bad.<p>The Model 3 weighs around 4000 pounds, as do the Ford Taurus, Chevy Camaro and BMW 3 series, all vehicles of approximately the same size.<p>Some cars are lighter than this. Some are heavier. In general the existing production electric cars tend to be on the heavier side because premium car buyers prefer longer range to less weight, and that&#x27;s the trade off. But there is nothing inherently requiring that, and in fact electric cars with smaller&#x2F;lighter batteries would be cheaper, so that&#x27;s likely to be what happens as more affordable electric cars become available.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t make EVs superlight by stripping down the body, for example.<p>If you have an electric car with a 1500 pound battery and a 300 mile range, there is a fairly obvious way to make one that has a 100 mile range and weighs 1000 pounds less, and it doesn&#x27;t require changing the size of the cabin. You might even get more than 100 miles of range by doing this, because now the car weighs 1000 pounds less and requires less energy to accelerate.<p>&gt; EVs aren&#x27;t the savior of the environment, public transit is.<p>Public transit is inapplicable to any place without enough density to support it. More than two thirds of Americans live in suburban or rural areas. We could build <i>millions</i> of new high density housing units and the majority would still live in suburban and rural areas -- and that&#x27;s unlikely to change, because housing is scarce and only a fraction of those units would be converted specifically because of how many more units you can put on a lot for high density housing. If you build 20 units to a lot you could <i>double</i> the number of urban housing units while only reducing the number of suburban&#x2F;rural units by 2.5%.<p>All of the people who live there will continue to need cars.\n\n                        &gt; Now you&#x27;re talking about highways. People don&#x27;t typically drive at highway speeds on city streets.<p>That was an illustrative example. Tires typically overtakes engine noise at about 25mph. That&#x27;s city street speeds. (In most car-dependent cities 40-50 is also typical city street speed.) Again, this is why tires are the majority of car noise. When you hear a car pass by on a non-highway road, you&#x27;re mostly hearing tires.<p>If wind is a serious factor either you need to publish your secret findings or link me to some research I&#x27;m not finding.\n\n                          &gt; Tires typically overtakes engine noise at about 25mph.<p>This is like saying &quot;a person typically travels at 30MPH&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean anything. An off-road truck with knobby tires is going to have more tire noise than a sedan with snow tires which will have more than the same sedan with low rolling resistance tires. An 80s muscle car will have more engine noise than a modern 4-cylinder sedan which will have more than an electric vehicle. A gasoline vehicle under acceleration (as in stop-and-go city traffic) will have much more engine noise at a given speed. Tire noise is affected by the roadway material in addition to the vehicle. Tire noise in a 4000 pound electric car might overtake &quot;engine noise&quot; at a lower speed than it does for a 4000 pound V8, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s quieter, not louder.<p>&gt; When you hear a car pass by on a non-highway road, you&#x27;re mostly hearing tires.<p>Then why does it make a &quot;whoosh&quot; sound?<p>&gt; If wind is a serious factor either you need to publish your secret findings or link me to some research I&#x27;m not finding.<p>I suspect the problem here is that the studies are so old. Here&#x27;s the relevant sentence from the Wikipedia article called Road Noise:<p>&gt; Noise of rolling tires driving on pavement is found to be the biggest contributor of highway noise and increases with higher vehicle speeds.<p>For this sentence it has three citations. One discusses the effects of road material on tire noise and not tire noise relative to other noise, another lumps tire noise and aerodynamic noise into the same category. The third, which is presumably where it got the premise, is from <i>1973</i>, when cars commonly used bias-ply tires, which are much louder.<p>But let&#x27;s not lose track of the thread here. The premise is that electric cars would be louder. A Model 3 is ~4000 pounds, the same as a Ford Taurus, so that&#x27;s not going to be louder. Some cars are lighter -- a Honda Accord is in the same class and is ~3200 pounds, only 80% as much. But then it has a gasoline engine, which is louder than an electric motor. Does the 20% weight difference cause more noise than the gasoline engine vs. the electric motor? Somebody would need a dB meter to even answer it, and that&#x27;s rather the point. Either way the difference is going to be small and people are just looking for something to complain about.\n\n                            &gt; This is like saying &quot;a person typically travels at 30MPH&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean anything.<p>No. It&#x27;s very different. It&#x27;s more like saying &quot;a person is usually about 5&#x27;7&quot;.&quot; It is obvious there are difference, but it&#x27;s not something that varies minute by minute, and the range of differences is not stated. There&#x27;s definitely not cars moving 40+ mph without making a lot of tire noise.<p>You&#x27;re right those aren&#x27;t good citations, I looked at it earlier myself and didn&#x27;t like them, but I didn&#x27;t go through the work of finding better ones. But seriously, can you find a single study saying <i>wind</i> is a dominant factor in road noise? Again, I&#x27;ve never heard anyone claim that.<p>&gt; Then why does it make a &quot;whoosh&quot; sound?<p>Because, that&#x27;s the sound it makes.<p>&gt; But let&#x27;s not lose track of the thread here.<p>This started because you claimed modern cars are not noisy except for those with modified exhaust pipes. I&#x27;m saying <i>cars are fucking loud</i>, all of them. Electric cars are also loud and do not solve for the problem of road noise at all. The fact that we&#x27;re trying to figure out if wind or tires is the source of the noise that we both acknowledge is quite noticeable makes no difference except to support my actual point, that cars are loud.\n\n                              &gt; There&#x27;s definitely not cars moving 40+ mph without making a lot of tire noise.<p>Based on what? A car with low resistance tires on concrete isn&#x27;t going to make a lot of tire noise even at fairly high speeds.<p>&gt; But seriously, can you find a single study saying <i>wind</i> is a dominant factor in road noise?<p>The one lumping tire noise and aerodynamic noise together is obviously contemplating that aerodynamic noise is a thing.<p>&gt; Because, that&#x27;s the sound it makes.<p>Tires make a rumbly sound, when you can hear them, as for example with the types of tires that make more tire noise.<p>&gt; The fact that we&#x27;re trying to figure out if wind or tires is the source of the noise that we both acknowledge is quite noticeable makes no difference except to support my actual point, that cars are loud.<p>There is a difference between something not being absolutely perfectly silent and something emitting a loud noise. Road noise for most modern cars at city speeds isn&#x27;t loud. Exhaust noise for cars with negligently or intentionally defective mufflers is loud.\n\n                                &gt; Road noise for most modern cars at city speeds isn&#x27;t loud.<p>If you can hear it and you&#x27;re not next to the road, that&#x27;s too loud. It&#x27;s noise pollution. <i>You</i> can personally draw an arbitrary line anywhere you want to determine what counts as &quot;loud&quot;, but the actual phenomenon is that cars make an amount of noise that is detrimental to our health, sanity, and wildlife.\n\n            As you note, no two dense neighborhoods are the same. Those experiences would be rare in Tokyo or Kuala Lumpur. I would say that cultural norms dominate density when it comes to explaining late-night partying.\n\n          I have never met a car that had a fight with her spouse that woke up the whole block at 3AM\n\n            You need better walls, aren&#x27;t there standards that apartment walls need to be sound proof?\n\n              Remember that in the US at least, many dense buildings are incredibly old, from before soundproofing and such was really common.<p>Living in a 1900s building in Brooklyn is vastly different from living in a 2020 building in Manhattan.\n\n                My early 1910s Manhattan building was fantastically quiet, with very thick walls. The only noise I ever heard was floor noise directly above me, never to the sides.<p>I&#x27;m guessing mid-1900s to early 2000s buildings are the problematic ones.\n\n            Cars get into wrecks all the time :)\nSeriously though we just normalise it.\nIf there is a car accident on your street everyone is awake.\nHow about cop cars and ambulances racing by sirens blaring at all hours. \nPeople blast horns way louder than anyone will shout.\n\n          NYC started making certain streets pedestrian-only during COVID. The silence was astonishing.\n\n            Same thing on snow days in Manhattan. It&#x27;s eerily quiet\n\n      More people in a smaller area?<p>Congestion doesn&#x27;t just refer to car traffic<p>Edit: think about crowded grocery stores and restaurants. Think community spaces like parks and libraries being packed all the time. Think about never being able to stop and get a coffee without waiting in a long line. Congestion\n\n        I would imagine that the answer would be to open more shops. Obviously, to avoid a NYC-like situation, you would have to bust the CRE cartels that keep retail square-footage absurdly expensive. Parks and libraries are harder... though building taller does tend to allow for more open land space.\n\n        paris proper is already one of the densest areas in the world (and definitely in europe). when i lived there i wouldn&#x27;t have noticed any problems with crowded grocery stores or community spaces compared to the comparatively low-density city i currently live in.<p>there definitely were a lot more people in the streets, other cities feel deserted in comparison.\n\n          &gt; i wouldn&#x27;t have noticed any problems with crowded grocery stores or community spaces<p>There are so many of them. Every block seemed to have grocers and a small park.<p>Where I am it’s a massive supermarket every 5km, not a small one every 200m. You can shop different when it’s less hassle to go.\n\n            Delivery also lets you have more smaller stores carrying the 80% you need regularly, and the 20% that is less common can come via delivery in a day or two.\n\n        I guess one person&#x27;s congestion is another person&#x27;s lively and bustling city?\n\n        &gt; Think community spaces like parks and libraries being packed all the time.<p>They aren&#x27;t, with dense housing there is so much room for parks that they are everywhere. I live in such a place, you go out and you mostly hear birds chirping, not people, it is a cheap suburb with high rise apartments next to public transit and everything you need in walkable distance including hospital and government services and hardware stores.<p>Dense housing means there is more room for everything else, not less, so everything is less crowded. Birds singing outside of my windows is the main noise pollution where I live.\n\n          That&#x27;s only true if we hold the population constant, and get everyone to scrunch together onto smaller lots built taller.<p>The main aim of density is to turn cities of a million into cities of ten million, not to just stick with a million and have birds chirping in parks everywhere you go.\n\n            No, the aim is to have that one million people occupy a smaller area, so that there&#x27;s more space for parks, open space, farms, etc.\n\n              Sorry, which density advocacy groups have this nice idea as their literal goal?<p>Density is the population of a metropolitan area divided by its total area. Not population divided by the footprint area of residential lots. Density advocacy is all about accommodating population influx; it is really burgeoning population advocacy.\n\n                Every group I know of that actually advocates for density does have this as their goal. It is a bit odd that the external reputation is that they do not, to the point that parallel orgs sometimes appear advocating for pretty much the same things but &quot;with more emphasis on livability&quot; or similar.\n\n                  Really? Is this documented somewhere? What is the typical proposal for how they plan to keep the population constant, after creating all that space? I&#x27;ve not heard of this. It&#x27;s always about how many more millions of people could live here if we rearranged things.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of a density advocacy group being opposed to population growth. Density advocacy is practically synonymous with at least acceptance (if not advocacy) of urban population growth. Population growth is in fact like a sacred cow. You must never blame any urban problems on population growth; the cause is always not enough vertical build.<p>Is there any example of a density anywhere going on record that the metropolis in this local neck of the woods should somehow say no to more people, rather than building more?\n\n                    &gt; What is the typical proposal for how they plan to keep the population constant, after creating all that space?<p>Have other metropolitan areas do the same so there is no net migration.<p>&gt; Is there any example of a density anywhere going on record that the metropolis in this local neck of the woods should somehow say no to more people, rather than building more?<p>There is a difference between refusing new people and having population growth as a goal. People exist, they have to live somewhere, increasing density increases the housing stock and gives them somewhere to live.<p>If one city is hostile to giving them somewhere to live and another isn&#x27;t, people might move from the hostile place to the amiable place. But the solution to this is obviously to make the other city less hostile, not to make sure that all cities are maximally hostile.\n\n        &gt; think about crowded grocery stores and restaurants. Think community spaces like parks and libraries being packed all the time. Think about never being able to stop and get a coffee without waiting in a long line.<p>It also changes behaviour.  People are under stress all the time.  It&#x27;s not a nice or natural way to live.  But it is easier to govern people.\n\n          ...This is the state of people living under car-dependency, not dense urbanism supported by public transit and walkable areas. <i>Car</i> noises stress people out, make them irritable, impact their health. Driving in traffic makes people angry&#x2F;furious&#x2F;insane (literally - it is not sane to pull a gun on someone driving past you but it happens). Prioritizing parking and roads is a colossal misuse of land which causes crowded public spaces; imagine if every parking lot was an additional market or park.\n\n            But, they are closing roads making them one way etc, that creates the traffic problem.  It&#x27;s bad governance - creating pain to allow government to administer the preordained &#x27;solution&#x27; - no cars!<p>Moving to car less city is the goal, but, as others note, the infrastructure is not there.  So you&#x27;re just pushing cars out...  with no real answers being provided.<p>How is that good government?<p>And the roads you call mismanagement are already there!  Removing them, deteriorating their use is what&#x27;s new...\n\n              This has nothing to do with my comment or what I was replying to, which was a comment about crowded public spaces.\n\n          &gt; People are under stress all the time. It&#x27;s not a nice or natural way to live<p>You might be thinking of packed slums in a developing country.<p>&gt; But it is easier to govern people.<p>Ah yes, like the French, a famously docile people who never, ever rise up against their government.\n\n            We just like to be vocal and share our disagreements publicly. It used to force a bit of honesty (it&#x27;s not working much right now)\n\n          I really think people underestimate how much of this is down to _taste_. Personally I&#x27;ve lived in pretty sparse suburbs of Dublin (by European standards, anyway; think semi-detached houses, as far as the eye can see), in the city centre, and in dense inner suburbs (walking distance to the centre, generally terraced houses and apartment buildings). I wouldn&#x27;t consider going back to an outer suburb, never mind a rural area. But I know some people who live in the middle of nowhere and love it! Couldn&#x27;t do it, myself.\n\n        Mixed use zoning solves that as businesses (grocery stores, cafes, pharmacies, etc.) are able to locate closer to people.\n\n        &gt; think about crowded grocery stores and restaurants. Think community spaces like parks and libraries being packed all the time. Think about never being able to stop and get a coffee without waiting in a long line. Congestion<p>That depends on supply and demand, not simply demand. More people attract, open and staff more shops, etc. It&#x27;s easier to find a restaurant in a major city than a quiet rural town.\n\n        This seems like a fundamentally suburban perspective, and I don&#x27;t mean that to be an insult, it&#x27;s just what all of my small home town family members and friends think, and it overwhelmingly and ironically relates to the real traffic congestion they actually experience coupled with the hypothetical imagined congestion they pre-emptively avoid exposure to by driving instead of getting on the train.<p>Not that there&#x27;s _no_ foot traffic congestion or lines, but it&#x27;s the same thing that happens in a case where there&#x27;s only one Starbucks in a sprawling suburb or business district at lunch time.<p>A high density area is likewise it&#x27;s own complex economy and system that seeks balance, when there&#x27;s too many people in one area, you just go somewhere else or enjoy or compete with it. That&#x27;s partly why Tokyo is simultaneously the most populated city on earth and one of the most quiet, clean, and least congested places I&#x27;ve visited.<p>In my sparsely populated city that sprawls, it&#x27;s extremely noisy, dusty, time consuming to get around, the infrastructure is failing, and I rarely bump into anyone I know, because people are only visible at the beginning and end of their journey. Meanwhile here in Vancouver I often run into people I know multiple times per day because we&#x27;re in the same spaces, or I can go somewhere else and not see anyone just like any other place.\n\n          &gt;Tokyo is simultaneously the most populated city on earth and one of the most quiet, clean, and least congested places I&#x27;ve visited.<p>Sorry, no this is culture.  The same virtues exist in Japanese suburbs, nothing to do with a city.\n\n            &quot;Partly why&quot;. It&#x27;s just <i>an</i> example, I&#x27;m sure other cities are more hectic. I didn&#x27;t get the impression that Japanese suburbs were particularly different than North American ones in terms of volume levels or how uninteresting they are.<p>It seems to me that it&#x27;s mainly cars and a scarcity of places to be that make cities horrible and congested. More pollution, more noise, less space.\n\n        &gt; Edit: think about crowded grocery stores and restaurants. Think community spaces like parks and libraries being packed all the time. Think about never being able to stop and get a coffee without waiting in a long line.<p>Have you lived (rather than just visited; extremely tourist-oriented areas can be broken in the way you describe, because all of the tourists stay there) in a large dense city? I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions (chiefly places with broken zoning&#x2F;planning) but _in general_, if there&#x27;s enough traffic for the cafe that people have to wait in long lines, _someone will open a cafe_. To the point where &quot;there are a silly number of cafes&quot; is a complaint people sometimes make about such cities.<p>Same goes for the rest of it, of course, but &quot;dense cities have insufficient cafe provision&quot; is a particularly bizarre take.<p>In Dublin (not a massively dense city; it&#x27;s about a quarter the density of Paris, or a little less than San Francisco), we had an almost complete collapse of construction following the financial crisis, only really resuming around 2014. One interesting consequence of this was _fake cafes_. When you build an apartment block, you probably want to do _something_ with the ground floor, and in urban apartment blocks it&#x27;ll rarely be used for housing; instead it&#x27;ll be used for retail units. So if you build the apartment block, and then the next day the construction industry collapses and there&#x27;s an unfinished site next door for five years, what do you do with the retail units? You don&#x27;t want them to look derelict, so you put in fake cafes! (Via images on the windows).<p>Growth has since resumed, the unfinished sites are gone, and the fake cafes have become manifest, adding to the bafflingly large number of cafes in the city.\n\n      The higher the density, the more vehicles get in each others way.<p>If your reply is that the vehicles are not needed because everyone can just walk: it takes more energy and more carbon emissions to walk a mile than it takes to drive a vehicle a mile -- and that&#x27;s before we get to transporting things other than people. (Growing food is very energy intensive; walking burns food.)\n\n        &quot;it takes more energy and more carbon emissions to walk a mile than it takes to drive a vehicle a mile&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve never heard that before, can you expand on that?\n\n          I wouldnt be completely surprised if it were true, though I lack the background and willpower to try to get an actual answer lol.<p>My thought process is that food also implies some level of driving (delivering pesticides&#x2F;fertilizer, driving crops away), the fertilizers are fossil-fuel derived, and if you count the sun it takes to grow crops to eat (or worse, as feed for meat).<p>The whole chain is pretty inefficient, too. Crops are pretty good at converting sunlight to stored energy, but animals and us are bad at retrieving that stored energy. The losses compound if we&#x27;re eating meat.<p>Walking isn&#x27;t a particularly efficient method of movement either, to my understanding.<p>The energy gets a bit spurious though. One could argue that if we&#x27;re going to count sunlight going into the crops, we should do the same for the sunlight that raised the dinos so they could become oil.<p>I also would wager that starts and stops would impact this heavily. The human weighs a lot less so they can accelerate&#x2F;decelerate much cheaper. The car would have a better edge on a long, straight mile with no stops.\n\n            A human walking is absurdly efficient, as anyone who&#x27;s ever tried to outrun a bad diet can tell you. Running or walking a mile burns ~100 extra calories relative to sitting on your couch. Unless you&#x27;re putting active effort into not doing so, most diets fluctuate by far more than that.\n\n              Sure, but it is also true that food that is healthy for people is an absurdly expensive form of energy compared to gasoline.\n\n                If we make free the largest costs of gas, greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n                  Even if we count the cost of the co2 emissions: it probably takes more petroleum products to grow the food for the walking delivery workers than it takes to fuel the delivery truck.\n\n          I don&#x27;t remember where I heard it, only that it was an expert on agriculture saying it.<p>The easiest way to see that it is plausible is to note that only 400 years ago, something like 90% of all human labor went into growing food, which is the way agricultural societies had always been everywhere. The way society was able reduce that to the 5% or so it is today was to use fossil fuels. The first big reduction came with the mechanization of textile production, freeing the food-growers from the need to make their own yarn and weave it into fabric to make clothes with. The tractor was of course also responsible for a drastic reduction in human labor as input to food-growing. Also, the replacement of horses with trucks for transportation of food from the farm to the nearest rail head or port or river (and transportation of inputs like fertilizer to the farm) meant that the food-growers could concentrate on growing food for people now that horses were much less needed.<p>It&#x27;s not just the extra calories needed to walk as opposed to rest or to watch television: it&#x27;s the fact that a single person in a delivery truck can do the work of a dozen people who have to do the deliveries on foot, and keeping one person alive and productive costs only one twelfth as much as keeping a dozen alive and productive -- even if no one walks anywhere or does any exercise. Sometimes for example in order to remain alive and productive, one of the dozen will need to visit a doctor. The doctor requires food to stay alive and productive. Doctors don&#x27;t live forever and so need to be replaced, and that is an expensive process in part because medical students need food and lots of other energy-requiring things to stay alive and able to learn (and to grow from babies to people mature enough to go to medical school).<p>My guess is that that analysis continues to hold even if the dozen delivery workers can take public transportation as well as walk although maybe we have to replace &quot;dozen&quot; with &quot;six&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that restricting vehicles in Paris is a bad move: I&#x27;m just saying that the effects on, e.g., carbon emission is not <i>obviously</i> good and that the planners who chose (e.g., <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Paris\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Pa...</a>) to devote a large fraction of the area of cities to make it easy for vehicle traffic to flow were not just stupid benighted fools or evil people bent on making life worse for everyone.\n\n            When people suggest that we reduce the number of cars driven, they are generally not talking about reducing commercial delivery vehicles [1]. Obviously our civilization depends on moving essential stuff around, and we need to do continue doing that, albeit with a electrified fleet of trucks&#x2F;vans. The problem is with private cars, electric or internal combustion.<p>[1] Excluding Uber style car-based food delivery services.\n\n              OK, but some people here are asserting that the more urban density, the better, and neglecting to consider that if the density gets high enough, the commercial delivery vehicles are stuck in traffic most of the time <i>or</i> the residents of the city refrain from buying things that would enhance their lives if it weren&#x27;t so expensive or tedious to move things around the city.\n\n                Which is why if you&#x27;ve ever lived far outside the city, you&#x27;re tired of people from the city coming out to visit you to buy all the stuff they can&#x27;t get in the city.<p>Oh, no, it&#x27;s the other way round, mostly. It&#x27;s easier to deliver a quantity and variety of goods to a dense area than the sticks. Which is why &quot;go shopping&quot; is a suggestion for people going to NYC, not Tucson.\n\n                  In deciding between a city where personal vehicles are banned or discouraged and a city where they are allowed, noting the virtues of cities over rural areas is relevant how?\n\n        &gt; it takes more energy and more carbon emissions to walk a mile than it takes to drive a vehicle a mile<p>Do you have a source for this? Sounds questionable.\n\n          It&#x27;s false. People will not go into suspend mode when not walking; they still burn calories. A very large person would burn about 130 calories walking a mile. i.e. one large latte. And most people who are this large are not at risk of a caloric deficit by burning an extra 130 calories.\n\n            I agree that OP&#x27;s assertion sounds dubious (especially considering the entire supply chain) but calories are a measure of energy, not CO2. You need to know the rate of CO2 emitted per kcal.\n\n              I&#x27;m not claiming that the CO2 exhaled by people is relevant. I&#x27;m claiming that growing food requires significant energy inputs unless you want to go back to the world where most human labor went into growing food.\n\n            A single mile, no.<p>100 miles? That seems very likely. That happens far quicker for the energy leaking heat machine sitting in the seat.<p>So, while maybe the theme of the statement is correct?\n\n              It&#x27;s simply not.\n\n            Humans are INSANELY efficient at walking. That&#x27;s why walking and running are terrible ways to lose weight.\n\n              About 2x as efficient as a Model 3.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_efficiency_in_transport\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_efficiency_in_transport</a>\n\n                Yeah well I&#x27;m not exactly 4000 pounds or going 60mph hah\n\n          The problem that this is the wrong measure to use emissions per mile, when it&#x27;s really about emissions per trip.<p>A car flying down the freeway uses less emissions per mile, but if one is traveling 50 miles versus just walking to down the block the former is using a lot more emissions even if it is more efficient per mile.\n\n        High density is what enables mass rail transportation, which is much more efficient than personal vehicles.\n\n          Mass rail is most efficient when it&#x27;s full.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;conserve&#x2F;public_transportation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;conserve&#x2F;public_transportation.html</a> - a full car gets amazingly close to a average train (USA).<p>And this is seen in that trains are most common where they can be mostly full.<p>What&#x27;s scary about that is how quickly busses just get outclassed - they have to be as big as their biggest loads, but they&#x27;re usually empty.\n\n            How often do you see a full car? Average vehicle occupancy is 1.67, and has been for years.\n\n              Quite often! But usually in the mirror&#x2F;kid cam, because I&#x27;m driving the family somewhere.\n\n        This is simply abject nonsense. I know the research you obliquely referenced and it assumes you specifically fuel that movement by eating beef burgers. And even that&#x27;s on shaky ground.<p>You can use your eyes to instantly observe that car drivers are not reducing their caloric intake to compensate for the fact that they &quot;save&quot; that energy by not walking.\n\n        A 155lb human burns 177kcal when walking at 2.5mph[1], so that&#x27;s 71kcal per mile<p>There are 340kcal in 100g of wholemeal wheat flour[2], so walking one mile takes around 21g of wheat<p>Wheat flour creates carbon emissions of 0.80 kg CO₂e&#x2F;kg [3], so walking one mile creates carbon emissions of 170 g CO₂e<p>Driving a vehicle powered by gasoline produces tailpipe emissions of around 400g per mile [4]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;calories-burned-walking#Walking-and-exercise\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;calories-burned-walking#Wa...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;health-promotion-knowledge-gateway&#x2F;whole-grain-nutritional-value-whole-2_en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;health-promotion-knowl...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.carboncloud.com&#x2F;climatehub&#x2F;product-reports&#x2F;id&#x2F;9017061954\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.carboncloud.com&#x2F;climatehub&#x2F;product-reports&#x2F;id&#x2F;9...</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;greenvehicles&#x2F;greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#driving\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;greenvehicles&#x2F;greenhouse-gas-emissions-t...</a>\n\n          Don&#x27;t forget that the person would be burning calories even if they weren&#x27;t walking.\n\n            The figure for calories consumed when walking is <i>excess</i> calories consumed (compared to sitting still)\n\n              Are you sure?

Could you explain what you mean?<p>Here&#x27;s what I found: the formula given in the article is &quot;calories burned = BMR x METs&#x2F;24 x hour&quot;<p>But the METs for lying quietly is 1. The author certainly forgot to subtract 1 from METs in that equation, and could easily have also forgotten to do so when calculating the given numbers.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pacompendium.com&#x2F;inactivity&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pacompendium.com&#x2F;inactivity&#x2F;</a>\n\n                    It just wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to tell people &quot;you burn X calories when walking&#x2F;running&#x2F;whatever for an hour&quot; if they had to subtract their base metabolic rate from the number.\n\n                      I agree it <i>should</i> state the excess calories burned. I think the author probably misunderstood the formula.\n\n          However if the calories from your walk come from beef ...<p>100g of beef gives you 217 kcal [1], so you need 33g of beef for your walk<p>Carbon cost for beef is 99.48 kg CO₂e&#x2F;kg [2]<p>So walking one mile fueled by beef creates ~3.3kg of carbon emissions, over 8 times what would be emitted if you drove<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;foods&#x2F;beef#nutrition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;foods&#x2F;beef#nutrition</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;1201677&#x2F;greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-major-food-products&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;1201677&#x2F;greenhouse-gas-e...</a>\n\n            Oh and it turns out the carbon footprint for beef varies significantly by where the beef is raised. Average carbon footprint per 1kg of beef in the EU is 22.1 kg CO₂e [1], so if you&#x27;re in the EU your beef-fueled 1 mile walk emits ~730g of CO₂e, a little under twice what you&#x27;d have emitted if you drove<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebeefsite.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;33676&#x2F;uk-beef-carbon-footprint-is-eu-average\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebeefsite.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;33676&#x2F;uk-beef-carbon-footpr...</a>\n\n            Except the only people who eat that much beef are certainly not walking anywhere so it’s a fun “statistic” that has no basis in reality.\n\n            If I&#x27;m reading this right it&#x27;s not quite apples for apples, as it&#x27;s comparing the cost to create and move the beef, but doesn&#x27;t consider the cost to create the car, only the movement of the car.\n\n          A car driver could easily eat the same amount of food as a walker, the extra calories would be stored as fat. This also ignores upfront CO2 output from assembling and delivering the car and increased CO2 output from maintaining car infrastructure vs. pedestrian infrastructure. Not to mention numerous other externalities.\n\n    Light pollution is relatively easily solved, there&#x27;s just not much will to do so. Noise pollution is best solved by reducing car-dependency which is a non-starter in most North American cities; I can&#x27;t speak for Europe but I understand Paris to have undertaken a serious revolution in purging cars within the past decade.\n\n      &gt; I understand Paris to have undertaken a serious revolution in purging cars within the past decade.<p>The issue is that they have mainly increased the friction of using cars in the city (reducing lanes, restricting parking, converting avenues to one-way) all the while the public transit enhancements are running late, and whatever lines were already there saw a drop in service quality.<p>So increasing density would require a major improvement in public transit. Note, however, that the city of Paris proper already has one of the highest densities in the world.\n\n        That is unfortunate but realistically there&#x27;s never going to be a political overhaul of that scale where all moves are perfectly synced. As long as they&#x27;re actually working on the transit enhancements it seems completely acceptable to me (in the abstract; I&#x27;m not a Parisian)\n\n          Paris is building a lot of transit enhancements right now.\n\n        The same is happening in the UK. They&#x27;ve made car travel harder without making public transport any better (outside of London), which has just lowered the average person&#x27;s productivity rather than making any headway into tackling the core issue of people getting from A to B quicker, cheaper, with less pollution.<p>They put in some heavy traffic restrictions in my local city of Oxford by closing off residential roads, forcing all traffic down &quot;arterial&quot; roads instead and putting parking restrictions all over the place. A year later, there are no fewer cars on the road or increased public transport usage; some local studies by the university confirmed that. People just spend more time stuck in traffic travelling longer distances.<p>It&#x27;s like having a person with an injured leg and a missing one. Instead of giving the person a prosthesis to remove the load, they&#x27;ve just lopped the other off altogether, leaving them to crawl from place to place instead of hobble.\n\n          ‘ making public transport any better (outside of London)’ is not really under the government’s control until after the local electorate agrees to it.<p>So it’s a moot point when only one decision pathway can actually be budged by more then a few inches.\n\n          I feel like the best way to make getting from A to B quicker is for A and B to be closer together. Which makes walking or biking more practical and you don’t have to spend as much money on public transit.\n\n            A and B being closer works for cars, too.<p>A 15 minute walk is 2 minutes by car, five by bike.\n\n              &gt; A and B being closer works for cars, too.<p>Only when the distances are greater than short-walk distance. Cars take up (huge amounts of) space <i>at their destination</i> by parking. You can only push two destinations so close together before their parking lots merge.\n\n              Only to a point, because car trips have more “friction” especially in a city.<p>For example, you might need to spend some time getting to&#x2F;from the car or wending your way through a parking structure. You may need to drive a more circuitous route due to one-way streets—-and certainly can’t cut through a park or building. You don’t need fuel&#x2F;charging or maintenance every trip but it amortizes out to a small delay. And there’s traffic!<p>Anecdotally, a 15 minute walk (~1 mile) is probably about the break-even point. My spouse and I both went that far yesterday, one in a car and one walking, and yet we both got home at almost exactly the same time.\n\n          &gt; [car travel harder without making public transport better]<p>Erm aren&#x27;t you forgetting something?<p>London just quadrupled its bicycle network.  That seems like a massive improvement to me.  When I lived there, biking was...let&#x27;s be kind and say &quot;less than ideal&quot;.  Last time I visited I was amazed by the improvement, with protected two-way bike lanes right on the Thames and much more.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;momentummag.com&#x2F;london-just-quadrupled-its-bicycle-network-in-eight-years&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;momentummag.com&#x2F;london-just-quadrupled-its-bicycle-n...</a>\n\n            The comment specifically excludes London, as it works differently from the rest of the UK.\n\n            Since when have bicycles been public transport?\n\n              Exactly.<p>Poster was presenting cars and public transport as the only two options, and complaining that one has been made worse without improving the other.<p>That completely misses the fact that there is in fact a third option that has been greatly improved, even if poster doesn’t like it.<p>Hence “Aren’t you forgetting something” rather than “you’re wrong”\n\n        This doesn&#x27;t sound right?<p>If you increase density, you should be avoiding the need to improve public transit, as more people will be closer to their destination than it&#x27;s worth driving to.<p>For the same population increase, less density means people have to travel farther to get to their destination. More people travelling farther necessitates more public transit\n\n          Suppose that you have a grid-like road network across an area of 100 square miles, where intersecting roads go north-south and east-west and roads are half a mile apart. If you want to get from one corner of the square to the adjacent one, you have to travel 10 miles. If there are a million people doing this, you have ten million vehicle miles.<p>Now suppose you compress this many people into an area of 25 square miles, where the roads are still half a mile apart. Now the distance along one of the edges is 5 miles and the same million people only have to travel 5 million miles. But now instead of having 400 miles of roads (10&#x2F;0.5 * 10 on each axis), you have 100 miles of roads (5&#x2F;0.5 * 5 * 2), so each road has twice as many cars, or each bus has to carry twice as many passengers or whatever.<p>This is why mass transit works in cities and not in the suburbs. In a city you have enough passengers to fill the bus or subway car, in the suburbs you don&#x27;t. But if you increase the density without putting in any mass transit, you just get more traffic.<p>On the other hand, the people who say we can&#x27;t increase density until we build mass transit are full of crap. You can add a bus route in a day, you just buy a bus and hire a driver. In urban areas subways are generally more efficient, and those take time to build, but you can run a bus until the subway is built. It&#x27;s no excuse to hold up housing construction.\n\n            You can&#x27;t assume that the number of cars is a constant though. As point A and point B become farther apart, car usage goes up. When they become closer together, car usage scales down.\n\n              But as point A and point B become closer together, it takes less time to get there by car and then people do it more often. Unless traffic congestion eats the time savings, implying that there is high traffic congestion.\n\n                There&#x27;s a finite number of trips people can practically do - just because they live next door to work doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll commute more than twice each day (close enough people will return for home for lunch perhaps).<p>As traffic and travel times lessen, people <i>do</i> travel further and more, but only to a point.\n\n                  But who was contending otherwise? You don&#x27;t need it to be <i>infinite</i>, to be a problem all it has to do is not allow the reduction in driving because now distances are shorter and sometimes people can walk to not exceed the increase in density because now four times as many people are in the same area. Which it might not have done even without this, depending on how much more often shorter distances cause people to walk.\n\n                Cities are populated by people, not cars. As point A and point B become closer, people are less likely to drive.<p>If your mailbox is attached to your house, you can lean out your front door to get your mail. If your mailbox is at the end of your 20 foot driveway, you take a few steps to get your mail. If you live on a farm, and your mailbox is down a several hundred yard driveway, you might hop in your side-by-side UTV. If your mail goes to a Post Office Box in town, you might hop in your truck and pick it up while running errands.\n\n                  If you make something more efficient, people often use more of it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jevons_paradox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jevons_paradox</a><p>If things that had been a 10 minute drive become a 5 minute drive, now they&#x27;re worth it when before they weren&#x27;t.

I usually commute each way a good hour before rush-hour traffic, so I have a good probability of finding a usable bike. But during rush hour? Fat chance.<p>Oh, you&#x27;re going to point out that there&#x27;s a scheme helping you purchase your own bike? Indeed. What are you going to do with it, though? At home, you may be able to find a spot to park in your flat (it&#x27;s not my case). You wanna leave it outside? Sure, go ahead, if you don&#x27;t care about finding it in one piece in the morning. Ditto for the other end of your commute.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that bike sharing schemes only work in Paris proper and adjacent towns. If you want to commute in from further away [0], you better be ready to ride in traffic and have your own bike, assuming you don&#x27;t live <i>that</i> far. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to live in one of the places served by the new metro, it&#x27;s still not ready (but should be real soon now - fingers crossed).<p>So sure, having more dedicated bike lanes (and some of the new ones are actually physically separate from car lanes) is great. Although sometimes the layout is... puzzling? Bike lanes switching from the left to the right side of the roads, narrow two-way lanes (Bd Sébastopol), etc.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a &quot;revolution&quot; in practice. My commute goes from the east to the northwest of the city, around 7 km. Of these, only around 1 km is a bike lane separate from the traffic. And it&#x27;s ridiculously narrow. Bonus points for it being painted with a slippery paint for some reason (look up Boulevard Magenta). The rest is half on bike lanes shared with a bus, the other half on regular roads with no bike lane at all.<p>---<p>[0] Don&#x27;t forget that Paris proper is home to ~2M people, while the Paris Region has ~12M.\n\n            Safe (locked) bike parks are popping up everywhere in Paris\n\n              Where everywhere? I haven&#x27;t seen any recently. Are those being up in underground parking lots? (I don&#x27;t have a car, so I never go there)<p>I&#x27;ve even read an article in Le Parisien (local-ish paper) about how some of those bike storage units were actually <i>removed</i> for some reason.\n\n              Like in German cities? For the lucky 30 or something that managed to arrive earlier to the spot, and only on the main station.\n\n            For what it&#x27;s worth, I got a folding bike (a Brompton) to address the storage issues you cite.\n\n            One reason I don&#x27;t get a bike here in Seattle is because bike theft is just way too common, and I have no way to secure it in my house (not enclosed garage, no space inside to keep it). It is funny, because they have better infrastructure now, but the theft problem (and lack of police&#x2F;government care for the problem) means less people are actually riding bikes here.\n\n            The original post was complaining about increasing density and how investment in public transport hasn&#x27;t kept up. The previous poster said what about bikes, and you are now saying that bikes are not a solution to people coming from the greater Paris region. But that was not what we are talking about, we were talking about higher density (=more people) in Paris proper. Bikes are certainly a solution to transport in the high density city.\n\n              Only part of my answer was about people coming in from afar. The other, about there being nowhere to store bikes, as well as questionable quality of the biking infrastructure is about the city itself.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m actually saying this as someone who enjoys and actually does bike. When living in the city proper, I think there are very few routes for which the bike isn&#x27;t the quickest method of transportation. For my commute, which is pretty much a best-case scenario (modern metro with few to no issues, goes in a fairly straight line, don&#x27;t have to change lines, stations close to both home and the office) the bike is much faster: 20 instead of 30 minutes.\n\n                Bike storage was never a problem for me living in London, even when I lived on a tiny canal boat. I can’t imagine Parisian’s bicycles are that different nor their homes much smaller than a boat or my 75m2 flat. Yes, I also have a cargo bike for transporting kids. The only thing stopping anyone from cycling is their anxiety and sense of car-owing identity\n\n                  &gt; my 75m2 flat<p>Wouldn&#x27;t we all love to have such a big flat.<p>I was talking to a friend living in London, and it would indeed seem that flats tend to be bigger over there. We do have many 100+ m2 flats, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s just that most locals can&#x27;t afford those and live in shoeboxes instead.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that the layout doesn&#x27;t always lend itself to storing a bike, most flats being rather old. Even though I would technically have the surface area to store a bike, it&#x27;d have to be in an awkward place to avoid blocking the passages.<p>Some newer apartment buildings do have areas for storing bikes more or less securely. But I doubt that&#x27;s the case for most people.<p>Instead, what I&#x27;m hopeful for, is that the local bike-sharing scheme will improve. And indeed, I&#x27;ve read a few weeks ago that they were rolling out some improved model, which they expect to be more robust.\n\n          How do people deal with being sweaty at work? Do offices generally have showers?\n\n            You wear wicking clothing, don&#x27;t ride too hard and change into work clothes in the office bathroom.\n\n            they don&#x27;t; it&#x27;s just not practical. You have to be relatively fit and energetic to do it every day, have no chores like kids pickup, have extra time on your hands, the weather has to be perfect - no rain or god forbid snow. This only works for a particular segment of working people out there.\n\n              The Dutch beg to differ[0].<p>Over a third of Dutch people cycle as their most frequent mode of transport. Over a quarter of all trips are on a bike. 49% of primary school students and 75% of secondary school students cycle to school.<p>Cycling has been a national priority for the Dutch, like the automobile has a been a priority for much of the rest of the developed world.<p>With e-bikes, fitness and terrain are less relevant than ever. Unsafe(car dominated) bike routes are the number one obstacle to increased cycling.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cycling_in_the_Netherlands\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cycling_in_the_Netherlands</a>\n\n                It helps that the Netherlands is mostly flat and has pretty good weather for it (I guess rain is kind of an issue). They also have awesome infrastructure and don&#x27;t just expect cars to do the right thing (they actually design and redesign roads to make biking safe).\n\n                I’m not biking to work in -17C. I have walked to the bus (including through 50cm of snow in a raging blizzard) and driven in such temperature many times.<p>A quick search reveals that the average winter temperature  in the Netherlands is above freezing, while average summer temperatures hover around 20C. Sounds positively delightful for biking. That’s not the case for much of North America.<p>Where I come from, generally in the Great Lakes region, the average temperatures range from -1C to 30C during the year. Not great for year-round commuting by bike. Some people do it, sure, but it is truly a commitment.\n\n                according to your own numbers, 64% of the Dutch don&#x27;t use bicycle as their most frequent mode of transport. Meaning that bicycling doesn&#x27;t work for the majority of population even when it is made a national priority. I&#x27;m all for it, but the numbers you&#x27;ve listed prove that it&#x27;s simply not practical for most people in the best of times.\n\n                Netherlands is on a sweet spot for cycling.<p>They don&#x27;t have 40°C in Summer like in Southern Europe, or -20°C like in the Alps.\n\n              I live in Paris, I have 2 small kids, and I don&#x27;t have much time on my hands (founder). I go to work (5km) by bike every day, whether it rains, snows, or worse ;)\n\n              It depends on the climate. If you live in California or west coast outside of rainy seasons, there really isn&#x27;t much of a problem unless you have a huge hill to climb on the way to work. Actually, that was my problem in Lausanne (3D town, I road up the hill every morning, and would be a bit sweaty, but I had my own office so I didn&#x27;t care).<p>Riding worked for a particular phase of my life, now it doesn&#x27;t, since I have a kid to take care of and the bike theft problem has gotten out of control in my locale.\n\n              I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s an issue for the general population.<p>My main gripe is actually availability of bikes in the bike-sharing scheme, since I can&#x27;t bring up my own in the office, and since I work in a shady area, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d leave it outside for the day. I also like the flexibility of not having to use my bike both ways. Think catching a movie or whatever after work and possibly getting a drink with friends. Although this is related to not wanting to leave the bike unattended for any period of time.<p>But nowadays, with electric bikes, unless you live on top of Montmartre hill (and even then), I think it&#x27;s no longer an issue. I have a colleague who takes her two children to school on bike before riding into the office (she works in a different office, where they have an interior yard with bike racks). Her bike&#x27;s got electric assistance and she doesn&#x27;t seem to arrive out of breath or anything. She also doesn&#x27;t seem exceptionally sporty.\n\n              Everything only works for a particular segment of people, but you exaggerate how small this particular segment is.<p>You don’t need to be fit, just not entirely out of shape — or ride an ebike. You can easily do chores, get groceries, etc. on a bike. I take my kid to school in a cargo bike regularly. It’s faster than driving (at rush hour at least) because there’s no stoplights on the bike path. And rain gear is a thing.<p>It’s not for everyone but haters always claim it’s for no one. No, it’s just not for you, stop being a hater.\n\n              I call it natural selection of the gene pool. Of course they dont call it like that in their pink city world.\n\n            ebike\n\n            Paris is mostly flat. As long as you aren&#x27;t racing to work, sweat shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.\n\n              Isn&#x27;t La Defense on a hill? I remember the escalators going up to it and down from it, anyways.\n\n              it is not flat at all\n\n                &quot;Other than the hill of Montmartre and the Belleville area, the terrain of Paris changes less than the height of a ten story building.&quot;<p>Hence, mostly flat.\n\n            I have biked to work over 30 years in various places. Some with uphill in the morning. The point is just that you bike comfortably. When I was younger that probably meant something like 18 km&#x2F;h in sligthly hilly places. Nowadays it&#x27;s less. You can actually debug your code while biking (mentally, no screen involved). I have solved many problems after 15 minutes on the bike better than in 3 hours in front of the screen. Yes, I avoid heavy traffic, even if it means a detour.<p>If you want to bike fast you can do it when not on the way to the office.<p>(I once biked in Dallas at 95F. There not getting sweaty might be a challenge...)\n\n            Offices generally don&#x27;t have showers.<p>People also generally don&#x27;t arrive sweaty when biking (at least not more than those taking public transportation in the summer).<p>To avoid being sweaty: go slower to not over-exert yourself, wear less clothing (you might be a bit cold when starting your commute, but that&#x27;s not a big deal), and if it&#x27;s still not enough (not fit enough, hills, etc...), an electric-assisted bike might be the solution.\n\n              Also: don&#x27;t wear a backpack if it&#x27;s not one of those &quot;air-something&quot; that allow airflow on your back.\n\n      The purging has really picked up pace in the last couple of years, and I think a major highlight will be the upcoming cleansing of Place de la Concorde.\n\n      Both the fight against car dependency and the housing policy in TFA have been spearheaded by the current mayor, Anne Hidalgo\n\n      Hear hear! Anytime someone argues something like &quot;I could never give up my car and live in a city! They&#x27;re so noisy!&quot; I feel like a version of that Goose meme. &quot;NOISY FROM WHAT?&quot;\n\n        &gt; &quot;NOISY FROM WHAT?&quot;<p>Sirens, people yelling, loud music, construction, etc.\n\n          Credentials: Lived in NYC for 10+ years<p>Sirens: valid.

And the usual offender when someone is yelling, it&#x27;s some doofus in a car yelling at some other doofus in a car.<p>Loud music: not often in my experience. And the usual offender when there <i>is</i> loud music, it&#x27;s some doofus playing loud music in their car.<p>Construction: valid<p>But the single most frequent &#x2F; annoying loud sound: car horns. Constantly.\n\n            It varies by area; I remember staying in Brooklyn with a friend and being a few floors up the traffic noise was minimal (constant), few horns, but it seemed an emergency vehicle went by every few minutes.<p>Most of what I remember of European cities, too, when anywhere near the denser parts.<p>Part of &quot;city noise&quot; is dependent where you&#x27;re living, and how new it is. Close, cramped, older building with people arguing above and below and beside you? Not fun. Newer building with excellent soundproofing? Nowhere near as bad.\n\n            &gt; Sirens: valid. But those suckers are usually attached to vehicles<p>But they&#x27;re attached to emergency vehicles. The fire department is not going to wait for the bus when responding to a fire, so you can&#x27;t actually get rid of this by installing mass transit, and then its prevalence is proportional to density.<p>&gt; People yelling: not often in my experience. And the usual offender when someone is yelling, it&#x27;s some doofus in a car yelling at some other doofus in a car.<p>&gt; Loud music: not often in my experience. And the usual offender when there <i>is</i> loud music, it&#x27;s some doofus playing loud music in their car.<p>If people are usually in cars then the people making noise will usually be in cars. But it&#x27;s not as if they&#x27;re going to stop having business disputes or lovers&#x27; quarrels or whatever it is this time just because they&#x27;re on foot.<p>And whether loud music is a problem depends primarily on who your neighbors are. In a city you&#x27;ll have a lot of them and you don&#x27;t get to choose who they are.<p>&gt; car horns<p>Ironically this doesn&#x27;t happen in the suburbs because there are more roads and parking per car, and thereby fewer traffic disputes and no need to summon someone from a building immediately instead of parking and going inside. So you&#x27;re now equally making the case for cities to have wider roads and more parking.\n\n            I&#x27;m not going to argue the point that cars aren&#x27;t loud they are!<p>However, in Manhattan the city is still very loud with 0 cars.  Meaning in the middle of the night in midtown, not a single car, the city itself hums with a constant noise that is not healthy.<p>Witnessed this during covid when I didn&#x27;t see a car for hours on a typically busy midtown avenue, but the city is still very very loud compared to a suburban setting.<p>So, we get rid of all cars, then what?  You still live in a noisy city.  No thanks.<p>Credentials: 5 years in midtown, 15 years downtown Manhattan.\n\n              With all respect, “didn’t see a car for hours on a typically busy midtown avenue”, even during peak covid, is bananas if for no other reason than the ambulances were going almost constantly (ymmv based on where you live).<p>But I distinctly remember watching the odd car here and there and wondering where they were going.<p>And things were quieter!  There was the background noise of machinery and buses and cars but it was a lot quieter than even holiday Sundays.<p>Credentials: 14 years in semi-rural Texas, 25 years in Manhattan\n\n                Living in Texas and Manhattan you should aware that we very good at adapting to our surroundings.  The relative noise is not comparable between rural Texas and Manhattan.<p>I agree the city was quieter during covid, and would be quieter without cars. It&#x27;s ridiculous to debate otherwise.<p>But a major is vastly noisier without cars than any normal suburb with the rare car passing by a residential street.<p>NYC will always be loud, cars are not.\n\n                  Noise pollution in big cities, particularly nyc, ranked starting from the worst factoring frequency:<p>Sirens<p>Construction<p>Buses<p>Semintrucks &#x2F; public machinery (trash, etc)<p>Subway<p>Belligerent people<p>Lunatics<p>Inconsiderate people on motorcycles<p>Cars<p>Buildings &#x2F; HVAC<p>Cars are near the bottom of the list\n\n                  I was just pointing out that the idea that one could go for “hours” without seeing a car is essentially impossible in Manhattan, even during Covid.\n\n        &gt; &quot;NOISY FROM WHAT?&quot;<p>More of this, it&#x27;s fun - when you don&#x27;t live there: trams running on insanely poorly designed, or maintained tracks, trams running on extremely squeally wheels (see design, maintenance), sirens (running on overtime and at full strength, see screaming people), preachers (see screaming people :-), protests (The birds aren&#x27;t real!), drummers, motorcycles (&quot;Harleys&quot;), dirt bikes (kids). In San Francisco, cars are the well behaved and quiet group in there.\n\n    Thankfully Paris was also super super super smart &amp; has rapidly developed dedicated bike infrastructure that is incredibly popular &amp; nice to use. It rapidly reduces the need for cars for many many people.<p>They also are restricting the use of cars in their city center, which will help force de-car&#x27;ing for casual use &amp; make people take efficient less demanding forms of transit.<p>This should help keep congestion &amp; din from being aggravating!\n\n    &gt; As someone who lives in an area with plenty of high-density residential buildings<p>And yet you live there, which means, presumably, that <i>it&#x27;s your best option</i> relative to the alternatives. People should be allowed to choose living arrangements that meet their most critical needs, even if they also find reasons to complain about aspects of those arrangements that are self-evidently less important to them.\n\n    France already has some of the most densely populated cities in the world, Paris is #32. French cities feel less congested than the likes of US cities because it has better cycling infrastructure and public transport options. High population density is not a cure for the bias car infrastructure imposes on a city. So your recipe will need to take more in to account than just density.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_cities_proper_by_popul...</a>\n\n      How does that linked Wikipedia page not contain any cities in China, which in my experience are more dense than just about anywhere else in the world?\n\n        one is that Chinese &quot;city&quot; boundaries also generally include a lot of rural land, mountains, etc. Chongqing is the size of Austria.<p>The other is that while the buildings are certainly tall, China also does a lot of &quot;tower-in-the-park&quot; style development where the plazas and landscaping in between tall buildings decrease overall density.\n\n        What is your experience ? China cities are noticeably less dense than other cities in Asia (Manilla, Delhi..) or even Paris\n\n          Most of Manila is an endless sprawl low-rise housing and single-story slums, with a few  areas of high-rise buildings (Makati, BGC, etc).  In the average large Chinese city, more or less all the housing is high-rise.\n\n            how much of that housing is occupied vs investment, and how large are the apartments? slums get quite packed.\n\n        China is deurbanizing and dedensifying. It&#x27;s a popular myth that Chinese cities are dense. Density peaked a decade ago.<p>This will spell economic worries someway down the road as maintenance upkeep costs start to kick in.\n\n        PRC cities are not particularly dense. Population densities in cities within a country tend to follow zipfs law, which would predict BJ and SH to be 3-4x larger than it currently is. Many economists and urban planners was suggesting PRC should densify tier1 about 10 years ago. But hukou anbd industrial policy seems to be designed to limit megacity sizes to redirect popuation towards growing 3rd, 4th+ tier cities into their own economic hubs. IMO trying to avoid SKR&#x2F;JP where everyone rushes to a few economically viable regions.\n\n      But why are French cities so densely populated?  The country is twice the size of the UK with roughly the same population.\n\n        There was a semi-arbitrary building height adopted during the Haussmannian reorganization in Paris. My feeling is people noticed it led to perfectly liveable blocks. (Most places go a bit higher than this by now but Paris is strongly attached to the &quot;roofs of Paris&quot; and actively protects them. So Paris is a mix of Haussmannian building heights and higher.)<p>In the 50es through 70es, there was a strong need for extra housing which led to the projects outside Paris (&quot;citées&quot;), to many factories torn down to make space, but also to much higher residential buildings here and there. Still worked fine (well, not many of the citées worked fine).<p>And people really, but REALLY love being able to walk to their preferred local baker and pastry shop (out of a choice of several of course), and to the local grocery store. The density has to be high enough to support these.<p>Turns out, high density also allows a great subway system. Nobody complains that it exists.\n\n    This is a huge problem with housing in general that is mostly ignored.<p>Let people build 4 units where today it&#x27;s zone for 1, and if you disagree, you&#x27;re an out of touch racist&#x2F;classist&#x2F;luddite who is just not a visionary and can&#x27;t embrace the future.<p>Surely nothing bad is going to happen when you take a subdivision with 30 homes and take just 10 of those and turn them into quadplexes.<p>30 homes might approximate something like 60 cars and 60 children.<p>Now instead of 30 homes, you have 20 + 10*4 = 60 homes.<p>You&#x27;re now asking infrastructure that hasn&#x27;t been touched since the 60s to accommodate nearly twice as many people. And I get that not every new unit will also have 2 children, but some will and it no doubt leads to a net increase.<p>Where as before the road leading out your development had to accommodate 50 cars in the morning commute, now it has to handle more than 100. And this is just a minor inconvenience.<p>The real issues arise when you&#x27;ve doubled the amount of school children, but the number of teachers hires or classrooms built hasn&#x27;t increased, and let&#x27;s not even talk about teacher salaries.<p>Then there are utilities and other public services (first responders, etc.)<p>This was just one small subdivision with 30 homes, now imagine this happening across multiple parts of town at once and you can see the problem.<p>All that is to say, I&#x27;ve never been against building more housing (omg build up! it&#x27;s so easy!), what I&#x27;m against is building more housing without proportional investments everywhere else.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem to solve, I admit it, but that&#x27;s my whole point. It&#x27;s hard, you can&#x27;t just build more housing and call it a day.\n\n      Maybe the reason people accuse you of being &quot;racist&#x2F;classist&#x2F;luddite&quot; is because you&#x27;re fearmongering, and they suspect these talking points are just a cover for looking out for your financial interest (keep increasing property prices), or keeping your community free from &quot;others&quot; or something.<p>Why is this fearmongering? Because your figures are wildly, wildly out of touch with reality. If you legalize quadplexes by right, you&#x27;re <i>not</i> going to magically see a doubling of housing, there just aren&#x27;t that many people! That is completely made up bullshit. Fast growing place have growth rates in the low single digits, like 2%&#x2F;a, not 50%. Growth projections for fast growing regions like the Toronto area have 50% growth projections on the scale of <i>decades</i>. But &quot;If we legalize quadplexes, our 100 home with turn into 102 home next years and there&#x27;ll be one extra car&quot; just doesn&#x27;t have the same zing and it&#x27;s hard to keep the housing crisis going with realistic complaints.\n\n        How is this fearmongering?<p>I can just as easily accuse you of moral righteousness, it&#x27;s not a cover for anything, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening and with neither you nor I citing sources, it&#x27;s just your word against mine.<p>Even then, come up with whatever cutesy numbers you want regarding housing, there are concrete numbers to point to for the side effects. Depressed teacher salaries is a well known issue. Overcrowding in schools is a real issue. Congestion and lack of public transportation is a real issue.<p>You can argue causality all you want, but if you leave out suddenly overpopulating areas as part of your equation, it&#x27;s already flawed.<p>Lastly, you didn&#x27;t read what I said.<p>I said it&#x27;s fine to build more housing provides it comes with equal investments in infrastructure. You conveniently glossed over this fact because your solution of building taller still doesn&#x27;t address it. So no, build taller isn&#x27;t the only solution.<p>Again, reread what I said. I&#x27;m not against building more housing. Do you understand that? Again, I am not against building more housing.<p>All for building out public transportation, all for doing that is required to build more housing.<p>So either you take a slow and moderate approach to building more housing, which is fine, and will allow other infrastructure more time to catch up, or you make these investments up front with your larger scale development, as long as it&#x27;s addressed it&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.<p>Not sure what you&#x27;re so up in arms about.\n\n      It is not a hard problem to solve and was&#x2F;is being solved all around the world. If a developer is building not 60 homes but 6000 homes then they can be tasked to build a school, a few kindergartens, a fire station, cafes, grocery shop, a few bus stops and plenty of individual and communal parking spaces.<p>Going from single family homes to quadplexes does not solve the problem, build taller!\n\n      &gt; 30 homes might approximate something like 60 cars and 60 children.<p>&gt; Now instead of 30 homes, you have 20 + 10*4 = 60 homes.<p>Not building the houses doesn&#x27;t make the people go away. What ends up happening is they have to commute in from somewhere else, and<p>&gt; the road leading out your development had to accommodate 50 cars in the morning commute, now it has to handle more than 100<p>happens in a different road.<p>(sure, in the long run people learn not to have children in the West because living space is scarce, and your &quot;doubled the amount of school children&quot; problem goes away)\n\n    As someone who lives in an area with plenty of high-density residential buildings, I can attest that I love it and I wish there were more American cities that were an option for my lifestyle.\n\n      America is filled with high rises.  Where are you from?\n\n        What do you mean? In my experience outside of the few major cities (New York, LA, etc.) there are only high rises in the very downtown of large cities.\n\n          i don&#x27;t remember any high rises outside of downtown in LA either.<p>and most of those downtown high rises in most cities are office buildings. New York is really the exception.\n\n          Highrises are just apartments.<p>Very large like Columbus Ohio?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borror.com&#x2F;high-rise-apartments-columbus-ohio&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borror.com&#x2F;high-rise-apartments-columbus-ohio&#x2F;</a><p>Waterkloof, Maine\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.booking.com&#x2F;hotel&#x2F;za&#x2F;menlyn-maine-high-rise-1-bedroom-luxury-apartment.en-gb.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.booking.com&#x2F;hotel&#x2F;za&#x2F;menlyn-maine-high-rise-1-be...</a><p>Pikeville, Ky\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hapky.org&#x2F;myers-towers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hapky.org&#x2F;myers-towers.html</a>\n\n            I guess I tend to think of &quot;high-rise&quot; as a synonym for skyscraper. Something in the neighborhood of 10+ stories. I&#x27;m fairly certain that Columbus at least doesn&#x27;t have many residential buildings that high outside of its downtown.<p>However, if we are counting 3 or so story apartments then there are definitely high-rises all over the place like you say.\n\n    Cool cool, except the situation is dire and people need a roof over their head. Other priorities can wait.\n\n    &gt; congested cities with such intense light and noise pollution<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you mean that. Obviously you know that many people love cities with lots of tall buildings, NYC being the obvious US example. Clearly you don&#x27;t like them, but are you saying the busy-ness is inherently bad? If you don&#x27;t like it, can you leave? Usually, that&#x27;s an expensive place to live.\n\n    Part of the draw of a city is bustling night life. You don&#x27;t move to Manhattan for dark skies.\n\n      Can we at least acknowledge that it is not universally a draw, and many people actually hate it?\n\n    What is making the noise?\n\n    It&#x27;s literally been dubbed the City of Light and the highest density cities in France already. It&#x27;s not even close.\n\n    Cities aren’t loud. Cars are.\n\n      Cars are very loud, Cities are still loud with 0 cars.<p>Source: Manhattan, NYC\n\n  Building taller means people see the sky less. In my home city that is the case and you definitely dont want that. Where ive been living the last few years, no building is above 3 stories and its wonderful.\n\n    Not necessarily.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between building a tall building with a large uniform floorplate that takes up much of a block and a tall building that is thin, only taking up a tiny slice of a block, and thus allowing sunlight to pass through.<p>For this reason gloomy Vancouver for a long time mandated point towers, for the purpose of maximizing light.<p>Paris&#x27; status quo of uniform 6 story streetwalls could arguably let in <i>less</i> light than a mixed amount of much taller <i>thinner</i> towers on 3 story podiums.\n\n      Most of New York has 10-15 floors buildings with wide streets. Light and fresh air isn&#x27;t a problem. But you can&#x27;t really widen Paris street and the uniformity of the architecture is what makes it a beautiful city. Tourists aren&#x27;t flocking to Paris to take pictures of some boring glass and concrete buildings.\n\n    For the same density, geometrically, you should see the same amount of sky it you are at the ground floor (or outside), and more if you are on the upper floors.<p>Here is a low rise area, H represent housing units, _ is the ground<p><pre><code>  H_H_H_H_H_H\n</code></pre>\nNow for the same density with high rise buildings<p><pre><code>  H   H   H\n  H___H___H__\n</code></pre>\nFor someone on the ground, between buildings, the field of view occupied by the sky is the same, that&#x27;s because buildings are twice taller and the distance between buildings is twice longer, which cancel out. Or equivalently, the average apparent size of buildings (how much of your field of view they take) is also the same. Obviously, people higher up have a better view of the sky.\n\n  Building taller is the equivalent of building more lanes. The main problem with housing shortage and infrastructure congestion in Paris is that everything is centralized and concentrated on Paris, and thus everyone want to be there\n\n  &gt; but it decreases social segregation. That alone is critical to keep a city alive.<p>So rich people need poor&#x2F;middle-class people to keep cities alive?<p>Maybe they should start charging for that ...\n\n    &gt; Maybe they should start charging for that ...<p>Let&#x27;s call it &quot;taxes&quot;.\n\n    It&#x27;s effectively doing just that - tax the entire city (which taxes are usually mainly paid by the richer people) and use the taxes to subsidize poor people.<p>So since rich people need baristas to serve them Starbucks, tax them to enable the barista to live near where she works.<p>It should work.\n\n      &gt; So since rich people need baristas to serve them Starbucks, tax them to enable the barista to live near where she works.<p>That&#x27;s a good characterization of what&#x27;s happening. But is subsidizing people to be service workers for wealthy Parisians a good public policy and good use of public funds?\n\n        Everyone needs service workers. Even service workers need service workers.\n\n          My service workers have service workers who go to the market FOR them!<p>Wait, that&#x27;s actually what we have now.\n\n        &gt; <i>But is subsidizing people to be service workers for wealthy Parisians a good public policy and good use of public funds?</i><p>Given that each of us is allotted exactly 8,760 hours in a year: Is it good public policy to force non-wealthy people to spend so many more of those hours in commuting than those who can afford to live closer to their jobs?<p>I live in a small, separately-incorporated city, a few minutes from downtown Houston, that has become increasingly wealthy. For several decades, the affordable bungalows built in the years following 1930s have been torn down and replaced by big houses. (Yes, my wife and I did that to build our house, more than 35 years ago.) Nowadays, though, many <i>really</i> big single-family homes are being put up on what used to be two-, three-, and four single-house lots. I get disgruntled every time we walk by one of those giant houses, because every one of them is, in effect, forcing two or more less-wealthy families to live further away — they&#x27;re hoarding the space.<p>(My own thought is that for big, space-hoarding houses like that, property taxes should be progressive, so that such a house might be taxed at 2X, 3X, 4X, 10X the per-foot rate of houses on smaller lots.)\n\n          &gt; Given that each of us is allotted exactly 8,760 hours in a year: Is it good public policy to force non-wealthy people to spend so many more of those hours in commuting than those who can afford to live closer to their jobs?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to direct public policy and funding to helping create jobs elsewhere and leave the wealthy urban people make their own coffee?\n\n            &gt; <i>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to direct public policy and funding to helping create jobs elsewhere and leave the wealthy urban people make their own coffee?</i><p>That’s certainly worth exploring too. But there’s a reason I no longer mow my own lawn nor do my own auto maintenance:  I flatter myself that I’m now more productive for the larger community when I do work that uses the skills I’ve spent years developing.\n\n            If we are going to develop the state capacity to override inexorable forces of nature, like the productivity and desirability of the metropole over the hinterlands, might I suggest we first give the people a good show by turning off gravity? Bring the Mediterranean climate to Chicago? Maybe do something about climate change?\n\n              I don’t know if I’d call it “inexorable forces of nature” as much as economic financialization and industry consolidation run amok.\n\n                The arc of urbanization is thousands of years old! Once we figured out how to produce food at scale without much labor, it was pretty much over for decentralization.\n\n                  Urbanization doesn’t require entire industries to be concentrated in a handful of cities. Wall Street and uncontrolled consolidation do that. The question is, can you achieve through public policy an economy where a large segment of jobs doesn’t involve delivering food to knowledge workers? I think you can, even today. Germany, for example, is quite urbanized, but far more decentralized (in terms of having many important large urban centers, plus many small urban centers) compared to say France or the UK.\n\n        California perspective: rich people <i>could</i> meet their needs for workers&#x2F;artists&#x2F;etc by liberalizing the market, but this would cost them property value and eat into the market rents they&#x27;re collecting. Favoring income-restricted housing allows them to address the same objectives without this blowback.<p>The cost of the necessary subsidy is calibrated to fall on grubby new-money high earners,  so it is effectively free for the long-established propertied class who don&#x27;t need much taxable income &amp; locked in their property taxes long ago.\n\n          Income-restricted housing isn&#x27;t sustainable, nor is it very accessible (you either win the lottery and have it, or you are stuck in a very long line).<p>Liberalizing the market doesn&#x27;t always work, even in the most dense economic liberal cities, the best environment for sustainable affordable housing is depopulation or some sort of recession or economic stagnation.\n\n    Rich people need to keep encountering not-rich people, rather than just live in a rich-person bubble.  They <i>need</i> that, whether or not they <i>want</i> that.\n\n      Of course, because what does it mean to be rich if you can&#x27;t show it off to poorer people.<p>Note, by the way, that this inflicts real psychological damage, and perhaps we could also make the case that this should be financially compensated.\n\n        Not at all.  The rich need it to maintain some humanity and empathy, not to boost their ego.\n\n          I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure it does that. Slave owners interacted with (some of) their slaves daily, and yet...\n\n      Depending on what you mean by &quot;rich&quot; they&#x27;re already insulated entirely, no matter where they live.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to make sure middle and upper middle class people interact with the poor and such, but once you&#x27;re rich enough to hire an assistant, you&#x27;re rich enough to avoid most anything you don&#x27;t want to deal with.\n\n  &gt; build taller<p>Paris is already among the densest places on earth.<p>The problem comes from the excessive centralization of practically everything France has, in Paris, leading to an overpopulation of the entire <i>Ile de France</i> region, which drive prices in Paris itself to the roof.\n\n  You seem to neglect the cost of it. The city is nearly bankrupt, parisians will pay for this with high taxes for a very long time.\n\n    &gt; parisians will pay for this with high taxes for a very long time<p>Is that a bad thing?\n\n      I guess not for the people who think they are entitled to the rest of the population subsidising their lifestyle.\n\n        So, everybody? It&#x27;s a city. Last I checked Paris was not full of homesteads and organic farms.\n\n  We are already the densest OECD city by quite a margin! (22,000 per sqkm in the inner 20 district, twice that of Manhanttan and 3 times that of Tokyo - and still 8,600 in the Petite Couronne, which includes 8 million people)\n\n    Manhattan has a population density of 28,154 per sqkm according to Wikipedia?\n\n      Yeah; they&#x27;re probably thinking of New York City. If taken on its own, Manhattan is one of the densest cities in the world; the rest of NYC brings it down a lot.\n\n  Don’t necessarily need to build taller, if transit (not bad in Paris already) is brought up to Tokyo levels (meaning an order of magnitude greater than anywhere else) then you just build densely outwards. Tokyo has far higher population but is mostly low-rise. A city like Paris has the bones for this.\n\n    impossible to brong it to tokyo level. our people are not educated like japanese people. add the strikes, the frequent infrastructure issues and we will never reach tokyo levels. also since covid transportation is worse since they figured out they could make more money cramping up less trains\n\n      lol then I guess Paris is doomed\n\n  it is already one of the densest cities on earth.. dont build within paris but modernize its suburbs and create more centers there. the public housing is actually adding social segregation as it is edging out middle class and now paris is segregated between ultra rich and poor people working to serve the rich ones\n\n  I&#x27;ve made a 3D map of social housings in Paris&#x2F;France: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charnould.github.io&#x2F;rpls-3d&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charnould.github.io&#x2F;rpls-3d&#x2F;</a>\nTerritorial segregation is a thing.\n\nBut it hasn&#x27;t stayed Paris, it&#x27;s overrun with North African &quot;migrants&quot;. Why put a bald faced lie on it?\n\nIf the USA didn&#x27;t endlessly fund war then maybe they could invest in their cities &amp; infrastructure more. Probably not going to happen anytime soon by the looks of things.\n\n  What is interesting is that after WW2 Europe had to rebuild and the USA was left with a great industrial machine that had a capacity that outstripped demand.\n\n  The Empire needs to wage war in order to expand its reach and thus sell its goods there&#x2F;exploit the local labour, otherwise it falls.\n\n  I would absolutely love for European countries to pay the true cost of their defense so I can drive on nice roads and children could be taught by people who make a decent wage.<p>Probably not going to happen anytime soon by the looks of things.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;wx7yj\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;wx7yj</a>\n\nWhy was this headline changed in such an editorializing way? \n“Mixed society” is a loaded term not present in the original headline.\n\n  What do you find &#x27;loaded&#x27; about the phrase &#x27;mixed society&#x27;? It is more descriptive than the meaningless phrase in the original headline: &quot;How Does Paris Stay Paris?&quot;.\n\n    Possibly because it presumes Paris is &#x27;mixed&#x27;, but actually the city of Paris is notably better off than the surrounding suburbs, especially the ones on the north&#x2F;east. This has some good maps: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;perspective-critique&#x2F;the-geography-of-inequality-30d738139340\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;perspective-critique&#x2F;the-geography-of-ine...</a>\n\n    Can&#x27;t help but be reminded of this classic:<p>THE VILLAS AT KENNYS HOUSE<p>The most sought after address in all of South park for only the very privileged few.

Note that the original is also wrong: <i>&quot;How does Paris stays Paris...&quot;</i>.<p>To me Paris is <i>not</i> Paris at all anymore.<p>The government is in damage control before the olympic games and shall try to hide that Paris is not Paris anymore but Paris honestly became a sad thing to see.<p>There are many tourists having an actual shock and it can be really bad: if I&#x27;m not mistaken japanese even have a hotline they can call if they&#x27;re in shock when they discover the shithole that Paris as become as opposed to the rosy picture of Paris that is painted abroad.\n\n    But, I mean... Paris was _never_ that fantasy version of Paris, or anything like it? Though arguably it&#x27;s a lot more like it today than it was, say, a century ago, or two centuries.\n\n      I&#x27;m going to guess Paris had more actual Frenchmen in it one or two centuries ago.\n\n        That would be a definitional matter. About 15% of Paris’s population are non-nationals. This isn’t unusual for a European capital; Dublin is 17% and Berlin is 22%, say. This would have been lower two centuries ago, though what it meant to be a national was arguably a bit different. However, what’s a ‘Frenchman’? Two centuries ago, most of France did not speak French fluently (and perhaps did not speak it at all). Even in World War I, 20% of the Metropolitan French army didn’t speak French functionally. Fluent French would certainly have been more common in Paris than elsewhere, but really you’re looking at a very weak national identity versus today.\n\n          &gt; About 15% of Paris’s population are non-nationals.<p>How would you possibly know this as France doesn&#x27;t record ethnic data for births?\n\n            Non-nationals are, approximately, non-citizens. Outside of edge-cases, anyone born in a country may be presumed to be a national of that country.\n\n    Paris syndrome is fairly over-hyped. From wiki:<p>&quot;Although the BBC reported in 2006 that the Japanese embassy in Paris had a &quot;24-hour hotline for those suffering from severe culture shock&quot;,[4] the Japanese embassy states[clarification needed] no such hotline exists[clarification needed].[9][10] Also in 2006, Miyuki Kusama, of the Japanese embassy in Paris, told The Guardian &quot;There are around 20 cases a year of the syndrome and it has been happening for several years&quot;, and that the embassy had repatriated at least four Japanese citizens that year.[11]&quot;<p>Out of a million people who are Japanese that visit Paris every year, a dozen of them having shock at the reality of the city isn&#x27;t that noteworthy honestly, and I imagine there are more Americans that do this than Japanese people.\n\n      A dozen of them having shock at the reality of the city <i>and call the Japanese embassy</i>. Don&#x27;t know about you but it would take me way more than culture shock to call my embassy when I&#x27;m traveling.\n\n      &gt; Out of a million people who are Japanese that visit Paris every year<p>That&#x27;s a staggering number of people!  Almost 1% of all Japanese people visit Paris every year?\n\n        Looks about right, if you look at pre-covid numbers. Post covid Germany still had 60k visitors per month from Japan, and covid slashed tourism by around 80%.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tourism.jp&#x2F;en&#x2F;tourism-database&#x2F;stats&#x2F;outbound&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tourism.jp&#x2F;en&#x2F;tourism-database&#x2F;stats&#x2F;outbound&#x2F;</a>\n\n    I went to Paris on vacation last year, and there was garbage piled head high on the sidewalks and multiple riots in the city protesting the pension changes while we were there.<p>We had a wonderful time.<p>The riots are scheduled ahead of time, so we knew where and when to avoid.  The garbage was not pleasant.  But did not stop us from enjoying awesome cultural and culinary and sight seeing experiences.<p>From what I can tell, this Paris has always been Paris.  It&#x27;s always been rich versus poor, often far more violently than what I describe.\n\n    I&#x27;ve been there every now and then over twenty years. None of this Paris isn&#x27;t Paris any more. Pretty much normal changing of a city.\n\n  Could be due to HN title&#x27;s limit? For example, I tried to submit a story with this title - <i>Google blocks man’s email account over nude childhood photo; Gujarat HC issues notice to firm</i> - but it exceeds HN&#x27;s title word limit. So I had to edit it to - <i>Google blocks email account over nude toddler photo; Court issues notice to firm</i> ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39756841\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39756841</a> ) to fit it within the word limit. Now, I get the use of &quot;toddler&quot; instead of &quot;childhood&quot; in the title does cause a slight loss of context, but it&#x27;s the closest match I could think of to retain most of the headline as HN guidelines demand. So the &quot;editorialising&quot; could just be as simple as us trying to be &quot;editors&quot; on HN to meet its guidelines, rather than politics. (Also, I didn&#x27;t find the term offensive and feel the submitted title is much better than the actual title on the article).\n\n  It looks like the New York Times changed it. The title in the &lt;title&gt; tag is the same as this post, in the article header they changed it.\n\n  The title of this post is taken from the linked page&#x27;s title element. It&#x27;s likely that the NYT changed the headline on the page after publication but did not update the title element to match. Happens all the time\n\n  I think it&#x27;s a direct translation of the French phrase &quot;mixité sociale&quot; mentioned in the article, I bet the connotations are slightly different in English than in French.\n\nBefore the invention of the elevator, buildings were more naturally mixed-use: shops (and stables?) on the ground floor, posh tenants on the first, all the way up to artists and baristas in their garrets under the roof.<p>By democratising travel within a building, ironically the elevator made it possible to have neighbourhoods for which service workers had to commute primarily from the outside along the x and y axes, not merely within the neighbourhood along the z.\n\n  this makes zero sense, plenty of cities with housing built mostly after the invention of the elevator that have mixed use neighborhoods with tall, low and medium height buildings alike\n\n    Yes, and those cities also presumably don&#x27;t have the problem of segregated neighbourhoods. (also those cities don&#x27;t tend to occur in my Old Country, but perhaps they&#x27;ve made progress there since I&#x27;ve been gone? Protip: never attempt to live in a &quot;city&quot; which is younger than you are. <i>Survivre plutôt que vivre</i>)<p>All I was claiming is that the elevator is necessary but not sufficient: monocultural neighbourhoods were much less likely to arise back when number of flights of stairs put a significant natural gradient on the price point of each buildable unit.\n\n  &gt; all the way up to artists and baristas in their garrets under the roof.<p>I don&#x27;t think there was any significant crossover between lifts not existing and _baristas_ existing. For a start, lifts predate proper espresso machines.\n\n    Good point; please substitute the appropriate word for the service worker who doles out glasses of wine from behind a zinc counter. (or did zinc also postdate lifts?)\n\n      Zinc counters feel very much an early 20th century thing to me. Like, I&#x27;m sure they had zinc in the 19th century, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine that bars were made out of it.\n\n        Apparently the bars (les zincs) did exist in the XIX, but were mostly shiny and not necessarily zinc-plated. (more that zinc, like AI now, was the cool thing then)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zinc#Histoire\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zinc#Histoire</a><p>&gt; <i>L&#x27;utilisation du zinc pour le zincage du fer ... a permis l&#x27;essor de l&#x27;architecture de fer, ainsi les halles centrales de Paris, le palais de l&#x27;industrie, les nombreux théâtres et gares monumentales de chemin de fer entre 1860 et 1880.</i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zinc#Lexicographie\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zinc#Lexicographie</a><p>&gt; <i>Dans les années 1873 à 1876, les écrivains français consignant l&#x27;expression populaire, aussi bien Zola que Huysmans, nomment zinc la surface propre des bars anglais ou le revêtement brillant des comptoirs souvent étamés ou cuivrés, plus rarement zingués.</i><p>... which puts them, if preceding, nearly contemporaneous with elevators. (but copper bartops must have been a thing earlier?)\n\nThe reality of this housing policies is that it is currently bankrupting the city of Paris with a skyrocketing debt and growing local taxes. They spent enormous sum of money to buy old buildings at the historical peak of their price, buildings ill-fitted to house poor wide families and sometimes in very expansive neighborhood where they have to travel far to get access to cheaper groceries.\nAlso the delta between the low rent and the theoretical market rate for the housing is insane, this is equivalent to several thousand euros in untaxed shadow income, all from randomness or special favor. All with the goal to transform 40% of the housing in socialised ones, this is a power grab of the mayor to assure them votes for the future and has always been the strategy of the communist towns surrounding Paris.\n\n  I love how &quot;giving poor people comfort&quot; is always actually a &quot;power grab.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure it does have political benefits for the mayor, but that&#x27;s also <i>a natural outcome of good policy</i>. (Not the only one; often good policy actually has horrible backlash.)<p>This comment could be expressing some true ideas but I don&#x27;t find it trustworthy.\n\n    There&#x27;s a line somewhere where &quot;giving poor people comfort&quot; goes from providing good and useful social services to essentially a bribe. Where that line is varies based on who you ask - for some it&#x27;s student debt cancellation (a US thing), for others it&#x27;s $1000+ subsidies for housing, other people may not see any service the government provides as a &quot;bribe&quot; of any sort.<p>Caring about these bribes&#x2F;&quot;power grabs&quot; is important (even if this guys comment strikes you as trollish). Just because you agree with a social service to benefit some group doesn&#x27;t mean that the people in power won&#x27;t abuse their power in the future. They might abuse their support by holding these social services (or &quot;comforts&quot;) hostage. Once you have people who have adapted to living in their subsidized housing (which can&#x2F;will happen quickly) you open the door for political leaders to say &quot;you must vote for me or tolerate my bad behavior or else this goes away&quot;.<p>Even if the method by which &quot;this goes away&quot; is that the opposing political group would be the one to remove the social service, it&#x27;s something that needs to be considered. To circle back, if you do something that is considered beyond the line of &quot;comfort for poor people&quot; and is seen as a &quot;power grab&quot; by enough people - you&#x27;re more likely to have the opposition emboldened to eventually remove that service.\n\n      &gt; There&#x27;s a line somewhere where &quot;giving poor people comfort&quot; goes from providing good and useful social services to essentially a bribe.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree. Like giving out literal tons of candy and soda would be a political bribe but I wouldn&#x27;t count it as &quot;comfort&quot;; it&#x27;s poison. If you do think it&#x27;s in the same category, I guess that would be my line - the aid should not be obviously harmful.<p>&gt; you open the door for political leaders to say &quot;you must vote for me or tolerate my bad behavior or else this goes away&quot; ... Even if the method by which &quot;this goes away&quot; is that the opposing political group would be the one to remove the social service<p>But that&#x27;s true of literally everything a government does, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s the nature of power being centralized that if one person can force a change, their replacement can undo it. Even if the 1st person is completely earnest and never makes such a statement it is implicitly part of the process and people will make their votes with that expectation.\n\n        You are free to not agree that giving housing subsidies is not crossing the line into bribe territory. I would say it&#x27;s important for you to understand that for many people, there is a line. Your example of unlimited candy and soda as being a bribe is a bit odd, but also seems demonstrative to me that your thinking on this is further to an extreme than you might realize.<p>And yes - this is true of everything the government does. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s an important thing to consider when the government promises to do something or provide a service. It can go away at any time, and people who became reliant on it will suffer it&#x27;s loss.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s really important to consider that for some people, certain policies can cross a line for what feels fair or what feels like a political bribe. Like I said, you&#x27;re free to disagree with where that line is, but pretending it doesn&#x27;t exist (or just writing off anyone on the other side of it) is a sure fire way to bring about consequences that just might be worse than what was originally happening.\n\n          I&#x27;m not pretending people don&#x27;t have their own lines, but I think they&#x27;re fundamentally wrong to say the line exists within the space of &quot;doing unequivocally good things for poor people [which admittedly may have negative downstream effects, as do all actions]&quot;<p>&gt; That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s an important thing to consider when the government promises to do something or provide a service. It can go away at any time, and people who became reliant on it will suffer it&#x27;s loss.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s something to think about, but it&#x27;s not a realistic impediment to enacting a good policy. If the worst thing you can say about a policy is that &quot;it might end, and that would be bad&quot; you should do that policy. Besides, government programs tend to get institutionalized and are often much harder to undo than to do.\n\n  Can you provide some sources on the Paris city’s budget and debt? I couldn’t find anything on it. France’s debt looks roughly linear, which I imagine would support Paris a lot\n\n    <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com&#x2F;leparisien&#x2F;YHOM53V5URCGPN5QJ56I6MMO4U.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com&#x2F;lep...</a>\n\n    This is maybe interesting or useful: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worlddata.info&#x2F;europe&#x2F;france&#x2F;debt.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worlddata.info&#x2F;europe&#x2F;france&#x2F;debt.php</a><p>It&#x27;s a comparison of the debt per capita of France compared to the rest of the EU (in USD). It looks to me like France started to take on more debt per person around 2007&#x2F;08 and as recently as 2022 had $13k more debt&#x2F;capita than the EU, or +40% more debt per citizen.\n\nEditorialized title. Just seems like virtue signaling to me. Unless anyone has a reason that it isn’t?<p>I was recently in Paris, the comments here are a touch different in tone than the Parisians I talked to.\n\nUnfortunately it means it&#x27;s extremely hard to live in Paris if you&#x27;re middle class.<p>If you&#x27;re upper middle class&#x2F;rich, you can rent&#x2F;buy. If you&#x27;re poor, you get a chance to get public housing. If you&#x27;re middle class, too bad for you.\n\n  You can put this on whole France, this is general approach at least for past few decades.<p>Ultra rich easily bypass all those populist moves to &#x27;tax rich&#x27;, poor have sometimes unreasonable protections (ie you can just stop paying rent, give big FU to the owner, change locks and maybe, theoretically after 6 months of courts he can evict you on his costs, while you trash the place into nothing without any recourse - some real cases of friends living there).<p>Its outright the worst possible place in whole Europe to be rich (again, those ultra rich are off the quite corrupt system, just check all (super)yachts in whole Cote d&#x27;Azur), government goes after you like a rabid dog, inheritance tax is easily 40%. All the bankers I&#x27;ve talked to (not professionally, I am just a normal guy) advised against any investment in that country before you cross ultra high net worth line, then all this disappears.<p>Yet absolutely nobody strikes against this corruption and unfairness, middle class just buckles up and continues, at least whats left of it.\n\n    &gt; Its outright the worst possible place in whole Europe to be rich<p>I guess it&#x27;s a good thing Europe has free movement! They are free to be rich in Amsterdam, Berlin or Brussels. If the wealth is generated in France, then they should put up with the French inconveniences.\n\n      Don’t worry I’m upper middle class and roughly 75% of my salary goes straight to taxes while everything that’s state provided (schools, hospitals, security, infrastructure) just collapses.\n\n        In France? How when the top tax rate is 45%?\n\n          Income tax isn&#x27;t the only tax people pay\n\n          That&#x27;s only income tax. There&#x27;s also social contributions including pension, health insurance, and unemployment insurance. This adds up to around an extra 20% tax (although pension contributions are capped so could be less for very high salaries).\n\n            Also, VAT\n\n  That&#x27;s the same everywhere in the developed world. If you are too poor you are taken care of through social programs(even in the USA), if you are rich you take care of yourself but if you are middle class you will have to fight for this privilege everyday.<p>It goes the same for the social norms. If you are poor you can have a trashy sex life and say whatever you like, if you are rich you also can have a trashy sex life and say whatever you like but if you are middle class you must have stable monogamous relationship with somebody of similar background and age(you can&#x27;t just have sex with anyone between 18 and 80 and throw a scene, unlike the rich and the poor) and watch your mouth.\n\n  The poor get a chance but not a very good one.\n\n  Wowow, the rich have had it tough since the 90s (only the French born before 1988 or so will understand the video) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L1N3WXZ_1LM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L1N3WXZ_1LM</a>\n\n    &gt; Wowow, the rich have had it tough since the 90s (only the French born before 1988 or so will understand the video) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L1N3WXZ_1LM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L1N3WXZ_1LM</a><p>Hahaha, it&#x27;s not one of my favourites these days but it was all over the place at that time :D.<p>edit: here&#x27;s a more recent take <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=maObYlDIRcw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=maObYlDIRcw</a>\n\n  Is it that much different from anywhere else in that regard? The fact the poorer people get something, doesn&#x27;t mean they lose something. I&#x27;d guess on average despite higher cost of living, they wouldn&#x27;t trade places.\n\n  I&#x27;m middle class and lived in Paris. I had rich friends and poor friends. My rich friends owned flats that occupied entire floors of a building. My poor friends got whatever social housing was available. And my middle class friends rented or bought a place in the suburbs with more space. We owned, a relatively small by American standards 55sqm, 3F, flat in the city center. My middle class friends could also rent the same size flat on their salaries but none of them wanted to. They liked their space and garden.<p>Their is give and take to everything in life. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to live in Paris if you&#x27;re in the middle class, but you certainly won&#x27;t feel middle class doing it.\n\n    With 2 children you&#x27;ll need about 65sqm. Hopefully the nursery is cheap compared to other cities -<i>cough</i> London- but it adds up.\nBasically you need to be in the upper middle class for a decent life with children in Paris.\n\n    No middle class family in America has a family in 600 sq feet.<p>You&#x27;d be hard pressed to even find this outside of a few areas in NYC.\n\n      People typically move further out so they can afford something larger when they get kids. Since the city is dense you don&#x27;t have to move very far for prices to drop steeply, unlike sparser cities, so you can still keep your job with a reasonable commute.<p>I know a lot of people who lived near the center when they were single so they were close to everything, and then moved 15 minutes out when they get kids. Selling those small central apartments give a big boost towards getting a nice home outside the center. Not Paris but the same European layout with dense suburbs, it really isn&#x27;t that expensive since those dense suburbs are still very close to the city center relative to American sprawl like in silicon valley where you have to drive for an hour to reach a cheap place, in Europe if you drive for an hour you get to the next city so even the cheapest suburbs are much closer than that.\n\n    highly doubt the last decade has been a nice time to be middle class in paros. salaries unlike us major cities never rose and real instate kept increasing. average is 10k sqm which requires you to at minimum make over 100k&#x2F;year to have a 40sqm flat not in top paris estate<p>give us more data to understand if you define yourself as middle class.\nsalary, rent, wealth beside salary. thanks.\n\nThe article is quite... disappointing for a french Parisian.<p>Let&#x27;s make things clear: so called &quot;mixed society&quot; is actually a mix of &quot;friends of the Mayor and allies&quot; and poor-enough people that will vote for the so-called socialist Mayor. It&#x27;s not about having a philosophical or idealogical view of society, only a practical view of election (a kind of &quot;gerrymanding&quot; if this concept is more understandable for US).<p>There has been frequent scandals with ministers still using &quot;low income&quot; housing for themselves or families. The article starts with the interview of some Ms Vallery-Radot, and that uncommon name prompted me to look on internet and wonder if she is related to the <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vallery-Radot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vallery-Radot</a> which was until the 2000 ... State Advisor.<p>So please... do not think that Paris is some kind of wonderful place where intelligent and humanistic leaders are working for the good of the french society as an example to the world. It&#x27;s just usual political shady business, nepotism (and you&#x27;ll see by yourself that the results will be bad during the Olympics for example)\n\n  By American standards, these would be eminently “intelligent and humanistic leaders.” NYC is ran by a crooked cop, who is under investigation for taking bribes from Turkey, while slashing the budget for schools and libraries so he can give more money to his “constantly defrauding the government” police gang. LA is such a wildly corrupt city, it’s hard to pick where to start, but several city council members were just caught on tape trying to explicitly screw over renters, rig an election against one of their left wing opponents, all while making racist comments to boot. The city also takes in billions in tax revenue for “affordable housing” schemes that go almost entirely to lining the pockets of cronies and party insiders through various fronts and nonprofits.\n\n&gt; The program has allowed Mr. Chaillou and his wife to raise their two boys in the city. But he knows that the future of social housing will always face at least one big challenge: “The problem is that once you get in, you never want to leave.”<p>I think this is the reason so many in the U.S. are skeptical of&#x2F;resistant to such plans. Why work your butt off for 10 years to get to a place where you <i>can</i> afford a nice dwelling if you can also wait 10 years, working but not pushing yourself, and someone else will pay for it for you? And then once you have it, there&#x27;s even <i>less</i> incentive to try to &quot;move up&quot; from there, because there&#x27;s now a cliff in front of you. You have to make the whole jump in one go, because if you only take incremental steps, you lose eligibility for your subsidies.<p>American culture doesn&#x27;t like to think about how much of &quot;success&quot; is down to luck. As often as possible, we want to think it&#x27;s earned. The idea of trying to make up for some of the luck factor by taking some from those with more and giving it to those with less is almost instinctively repugnant, even if it might lead to higher quality of life for everyone involved.\n\n  &gt; instinctively repugnant<p>To some.<p>In very-red areas that I have relatives, they&#x27;re happy to do a food drive, make donations, help pay for weddings or funerals, or show up to help repair houses. When you have 100 cousins and 10 brothers, this is a viable option.<p>They frequent each others businesses, work on interconnected industries, and in general help out however they can.<p>It&#x27;s not instinctively repugnant to <i>help</i>, or to <i>give</i>, it&#x27;s instinctively repugnant to give <i>outside their community</i>. That seems a more fundamental problem with tax-rich&#x2F;give-poor mentality. These folks make tons of charitable donations in money, in kind, and in time, but oppose wealth redistribution.\n\n    I think it is most repugnant when you are working really hard and (very slowly) building your life up.<p>It was really easy to be charitable when I was young and working meaningless jobs for $15&#x2F;hr  and I had my whole life ahead, and it will probably be easy when I am retired and no longer feel the strain of 50&#x2F;hr workweeks.<p>For now though it is brutal watching taxes eat huge chunks of your income so they can spend flagrantly.\n\n      I&#x27;m in the working stage and it&#x27;s the most charitable I&#x27;ve ever been, I finally have adult money. I can throw down  anywhere from $100-$1000 to help someone on the regular and not even notice.<p>What makes it so different for you where you have strictly more money than when you were young but have less money in excess? Folks in the comments saying being middle class is harder than being poor are insane to me, this is way better than when I was broke.\n\n    The hidden issue here is the effort of people with means to shape their community by expelling or excluding people they don’t want to help. Then their voluntary donations etc only help those whom they want to help.<p>Well-known examples in the U.S. include the use of legal covenants, red lining, Jim Crow laws, and sometimes blatant intimidation to shape who can own which property where. Such changes persist for decades because of the illiquidity of property in general and the compounding effect of wealth discrepancies.<p>So “outside their communities” is not a neutral, or purely geographic concept. Communities don’t just happen, they are intentionally constructed.<p>U.S. governments, in contrast, are ostensibly bound by the republican concept generally and the 14th Amendment specifically, to provide protection and service equally. Even if the citizens in question don’t fit the preferred local definition of “who we want to help.”<p>Edit add: I’m posting this because I think it helps clarify why some folks want government programs to exist to address social problems, as opposed to just counting on voluntary aid to solve it all.<p>I don’t want to leave the impression that I think government programs are perfect or without flaws. I actually agree with the comments above that point out how means-tested programs can create incentives to “stand pat” and not try for incremental improvements. It’s policy problem that is well known but hard to fix.\n\n      &gt; to provide protection and service equally<p>That is what the law says. It is not what they do.\n\n      &gt; Communities don’t just happen, they are intentionally constructed.<p>I, personally, agree with your informative pseudo-rebuttal (it&#x27;s polite and impartial so not really anti-them).<p>However, the philosophical difference is that<p>&gt; they are intentionally constructed<p>is precisely the point, they might say.<p>I&#x27;ve come to realize, after spending time with them and reading &quot;righteous mind&quot;, that the difference is so fundamental it requires a lot more power to cross divides than I have. I simply have to recognize the right and good intent in what they do, rather than denigrate it as &quot;not enough&quot; or &quot;in the slightly wrong direction even if enough&quot;.<p>I imagine a world in which they decline to pay, and therefore to receive, benefits from wealth redistribution, and urbanites who are highly paid like ourselves subsidize other urbanites who are not. I also realize this world would have &quot;rural&quot; covens of uber rich, and so it will not be more just.\n\n    &gt; <i>by taking some from those with more and giving it to those with less</i> is almost instinctively repugnant<p>I think the first part of this statement is crucial to the full meaning.  It is not about charity[0].  It is about redistribution of wealth by force is repugnant.<p>[0] This 2022 reports states US is #3 in charity (giving). <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cafonline.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;about-us-research&#x2F;caf_world_giving_index_2022_210922-final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cafonline.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;about-us-resea...</a>\n\n      Ah yes, the famous &quot;actually americans donate a lot&quot; nonsense. That report is based on SELF REPORTED donations.<p>IE, giving Joel Olstein $10k to help him buy a new private jet is considered &quot;charitable giving&quot; and is also considered more charitable than if you just chat up the Asylum family that was just settled next door and help them get integrated into the local community to help them network and find work and friends, despite being way more impactful to human beings than that fucking grifter.<p>That &quot;research&quot; will also consider donating to, say, an anti-abortion group or an explicitly anti-gay group as &quot;donations&quot;, as long as you, the questionee, consider them to be.<p>Also, being self reported with zero verification of any kind, Americans might just lie more about how much they &quot;give&quot;.<p>The IRS publishes statistics about claimed charitable giving. 2020 tax filers claimed about $150 million in charitable giving if I am reading the report correctly, so less than two dollars per American. That is definitely an undercount since most people who make small contributions do not itemize their taxes and probably don&#x27;t report their charitable giving, but even that number will be tainted by a person &quot;donating&quot; their money to a charitable organization that they 100% control.\n\n        You&#x27;re ranting incoherently. Americans give the most to non-religious organizations and charities by a wide margin (both individuals, corporations, and the government).<p>For instance, the US government allocates $7 billion+ annually to the UN World Food Programme [1]. The next biggest donor? $1.7 billion. It&#x27;s not even close.<p>And no, $150 million in claimed charitable giving in 2020 is provably false. One ultra-rich individual alone is enough to top that figure.<p>P.S: I&#x27;m not an American.\n\n          Giving 7 billion to a food programme is irrelevant when you have policies that enslave Global South to monocropping and force them to import your exports with IP laws (GE seeds) or when you have protectionist subsidies (as U.S. notoriously does) that makes your own exports not competitive. The harm of U.S. policy to the aid recipients is far in excess of 7 billion+, as you claim here.\n\n            Of course, it’s always the US’s fault. The Global South won’t take responsibility for electing buffoons as leaders that continually ruin their economies.<p>Rule no 1 - always blame others.\n\n          &gt; The next biggest donor? $1.7 billion. It&#x27;s not even close.<p>It&#x27;s almost, <i>per capita</i>, exactly the same amount - The USA has a pop. of some 333+ million, Germany has a population of some 83 million.\n\n    Except for their gay cousin, their atheist cousin, their trans cousin, their mixed-race cousin…\n\n    &gt;In very-red areas that I have relatives, they&#x27;re happy to do a food drive, make donations, help pay for weddings or funerals, or show up to help repair houses<p>Unless you are gay, trans, not the right kind of christian, have mental issues, are progressive in any way, are willing at all to contradict their absurd views of reality, want cheaper electricity through green energy, want any form of public transit, their family member has beef with you, you dared to question the authority of the local PD, you dare to question that drag queens are a threat, you think maybe gun control could have prevented the local school shooting or that the PD in that town could have done better and should be fired.<p>The belief that actually rural people are really nice and altruistic is just laughable. Having grown up with them, they will only help you if you are the &quot;right kind&quot; of person, IE, if you are useful or beneficial to them. My white, catholic, french mom in a city of 9000 was completely ostracized, despite knowing every single family, and being a very generous and nice person, because she didn&#x27;t have the right last name.<p>Insular rural communities are all about local tyrannies, and local cliques, and if for ANY reason, no matter how tenuous or bullshit or even made up, you WILL be excluded if the local popular club doesn&#x27;t like you. It&#x27;s basically high school, which makes sense when you remember most rural communities are entirely made up of people who didn&#x27;t do anything past high school and basically have not grown beyond that as people.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s not instinctively repugnant to help, or to give, it&#x27;s instinctively repugnant to give outside their community.<p>These are the same concepts. Being unwilling to help outside your community IS being unwilling to help.\n\n      &gt; Unless you are ...<p>This is a well-trod stereotype, probably for good reason, and it may also be your personal experience, so I&#x27;m not going to refute it generally. But this is not the case for the folks I was referring to.\n\n      Went looking for literature, this doesn&#x27;t quite address in-group charity versus general causes, but FWIW:<p>&gt; All else held constant, rural respondents were almost 5.2 percentage points less likely to be a\ncharitable donor, and donated less, on average, than urban donors, after controlling for human\nand social capital variables, such as education level, income level, health status, religious\naffiliation, family composition, and others. Rural respondents were significantly less likely to be\ndonors to secular charities, and gave less on average to secular causes overall. These differences\ndo not exist when comparing the religious giving of rural and urban respondents.<p>&gt; However, rural donors donated a statistically significantly higher percentage of their income to\ncharity than did urban donors. Also, rural donors are more likely to donate to religious causes\nthan secular causes.

As David Harvey says, “wealth redistribution is the lowest form of socialism”. I suspect he would say that mutual aid is the highest, and counter to many common narratives in our society rural conservatives are very pro mutual aid. I would speculate that it’s primarily wealthy conservatives who own and influence the media that really drive the narratives against other forms of wealth redistribution, while poorer conservatives are more in favor of social safety nets.\n\n  &gt; American culture doesn&#x27;t like to think about how much of &quot;success&quot; is down to luck. As often as possible, we want to think it&#x27;s earned. The idea of trying to make up for some of the luck factor by taking some from those with more and giving it to those with less is almost instinctively repugnant, even if it might lead to higher quality of life for everyone involved.<p>The US is in the ballpark of other OECD countries in terms of social expenditure: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.compareyourcountry.org&#x2F;social-expenditure\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.compareyourcountry.org&#x2F;social-expenditure</a>\n\n    The US government actually spends more per capita on healthcare than the UK or Japan despite it not being universal. We&#x27;re terribly inefficient with its social spending because have politics is so adversarial and nobody is interested in doing any due diligence.\n\n      &gt; We&#x27;re terribly inefficient with its social spending because have politics is so adversarial and nobody is interested in doing any due diligence.<p>And I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with the United States having a very unhealthy population and pays doctors the highest salaries in the world.\n\n        Chicken, meet egg.\n\n          I ordered one of each on Amazon. I&#x27;ll let you know...\n\n        8% of healthcare spending is salaries, is that your smoking gun?\n\n          That number seems impossible on its face. Healthcare spending presumably consists of salaries and overhead, and I can’t imagine overhead is 92% of all spending.\n\n  &gt;Why work your butt off for 10 years to get to a place where you can afford a nice dwelling if you can also wait 10 years, working but not pushing yourself, and someone else will pay for it for you?<p>Why would I have a problem with this if the &quot;someone else&quot; is a robot? Though I suppose, for the past 2-3 decades, it&#x27;s been more like, &quot;a worker whose productivity has been GREATLY increased by the advent if the Information Age.&quot; (I can see how the worker might be put off by that, but they also have the option of grabbing me and a few other people meeting witht he boss, and saying, &quot;We&#x27;re each going to do a small portion of my tasks, you&#x27;re going to pay us the same as you used to, or nothing is going to get done at all.&quot;)\n\n  I&#x27;m so glad I left the USA and moved to The Netherlands. Public housing in NL isn&#x27;t perfect, but the one thing I really really do not miss is listening to my fellow Americans share their opinions on the subject.\n\n    And you still get to pay US taxes assuming you are a US citizen.\n\n  &gt; American culture doesn&#x27;t like to think about how much of &quot;success&quot; is down to luck<p>Think it&#x27;s more surprising how little of it is down to luck. Even working slightly harder reaps rewards quickly that outweigh the extra work.<p>It&#x27;s most just most people are not even putting in the minimum.\n\n    Luck controls the biggest swings in some cases, but diligent hard work covers for quite a bit of the small changes.<p>Some people are just really bad at diligent hard work and lack the self control needed. The question is how to handle that without causing other issues.\n\n      Why do you think they&#x27;re like that? Whether it&#x27;s nature or nurture, doesn&#x27;t luck still play a significant role in what nature or nurture they received?\n\n    I think this only looks true on a local level. It&#x27;s easy to see why Jimmy pulls ahead of Johnny when Jimmy&#x27;s working more diligently, but they&#x27;re starting from a fairly even playing field.<p>A lot of the big cards are just dealt to you. Your parents, your skin, your religion, your school, your intelligence, your health, the neighborhood you grow up in--these things have a <i>huge</i> impact on what you do or don&#x27;t have to overcome once you&#x27;re old enough to take responsibility for your choices, and you don&#x27;t get to pick them at the start. They have an outsized impact on what you even believe to be possible, never mind what you think is normal.\n\n      Is it me or are you going into the &quot;You&#x27;re no better than me. You are just lucky to have been taught good work ethic by your parents&quot; territory?\n\n        These are the times I wish we had a life simulator because I think people would really start to understand just how many advantages they have and the ways they contribute.<p>It&#x27;s like how everyone says  they would be anti-slavery if they grew up before the civil war despite the numbers just not supporting that. If I took away your advantages and made you do your life over you probably aren&#x27;t going to break the mold and will end up roughly where everyone else of similar life circumstance ends up. What special spark could you even have? Because hard working and smart people are born in all walks of life but that only takes you to a local maximum.<p>You start having to consider that maybe white people are actually the superior race if you truly believe that it&#x27;s not privileges because how else do you explain the vastly uneven distribution of success in the US?\n\n        No, I&#x27;m saying that on a population level, it&#x27;s rational to assume the luck of the circumstances you&#x27;re born into, on the whole, is likely to be reflected in your average income over time, and while it&#x27;s a blunt tool, taxing the people on the higher end more than the people on the lower end is one way to try to mitigate the influence of that good or bad luck and level the playing field.\n\n  &gt; And then once you have it, there&#x27;s even less incentive to try to &quot;move up&quot; from there, because there&#x27;s now a cliff in front of you. You have to make the whole jump in one go, because if you only take incremental steps, you lose eligibility for your subsidies.<p>I don&#x27;t know about other places, but I think this is a major issue in France. Many things stop altogether if you get above a certain limit of income. So many people end up working for minimum wage, because if they got 1 € more, they start &quot;qualifying&quot; for more taxes, lose access to social programs, etc.\n\n    This is much easier to deal with in &quot;money payments&quot; (you just make sure that every dollar extra you earn doesn&#x27;t &quot;cost&quot; you more than fifty cents by having graduated wind down of payments) but can be much harder with things like programs that give you actual things, like housing or food.<p>It can still be implemented (not by saying &quot;if you make more money, you&#x27;ll only get 29 days a month of this house&quot; but making the cash subsidy for the housing explicit and able to be wound down) but it really has to be thought through.<p>You really want some way for lower income people to move to middle income without having to give up their neighborhood, friends, everything. But if the neighborhood is entirely &quot;working poor&quot; and &quot;filthy rich&quot; you can&#x27;t.\n\n      I completely agree. But somehow, I can&#x27;t shake off the feeling that the unbelievable complexity in all things tax-related (and I include social programs therein) is a feature and not a bug (as in, it&#x27;s intentional).\n\n  People also don&#x27;t like it because it in effect means the government is competing against you for property using your own money.<p>I.e. if the government buys up 10% of the posh neighborhood to add cheap housing, the number of posh units goes down 10% and you paid for the taxes to make that happen.<p>So you&#x27;re paying taxes to give someone else the thing you want, and make it harder for you to get that thing in the future. Then you hear about some corruption scandal where the government was overpaying...<p>I think American culture has a weird fetish for fairness. We&#x27;ll do something that makes everyone worse off because at least it&#x27;s distributed evenly. Admitting that success has a large luck component would mean admitting that the system isn&#x27;t and cannot be made fair, and I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an idea people can tolerate.<p>How does our justice system function if it admits that defendants in bad situations are there because they&#x27;re unlucky instead of bad people? How do we justify income inequality if we admit those at the top were lucky and that it would be a different set of people in an alternate universe? Basically our whole society is built on the idea that the system is fair and everyone is where they deserve to be because of choices they&#x27;ve made.\n\n    Fairness is not the same thing as equality, and most people appreciate that.\n\n      I don&#x27;t mean equality, I&#x27;m talking about the basic kind of fairness that I would hope we can all agree on.<p>Some children are going to grow up in abusive or neglectful homes, which isn&#x27;t fair to them.  Some portion of them are going to do poorly in school, which isn&#x27;t really their fault, they&#x27;re children.  Those children then become adults who have to enter the workforce or try to get into college and be basically ranked in a lineup against everyone else, including people who had loving and supportive parents that bought them tutoring and what not.  Where do we suddenly cross the line into being fair?<p>Repeat that situation across a variety of different attributes.<p>Sure everybody has to meet the same bar, but that doesn&#x27;t imply the same odds of meeting it, or work to get there, or risk incurred to try.  Is it fair to not build ramps on buildings because people in wheelchairs have equal access to the stairs?  Is it fair to not give poor defendants attorneys because they have equal access to the market of lawyers?<p>I don&#x27;t think equality of outcomes is desirable because of externalities, but I do think it&#x27;s worth closing the gap between the haves and have nots out of deference to the inherent unfairness in the system.  I don&#x27;t care for the extremes of income inequality we&#x27;ve arrived at under the guise of the system being perfectly or mostly fair.\n\n    &gt; the government is competing against you for property using your own money<p>Unless you somehow have an income source that doesn&#x27;t rely on any taxpayer funded infrastructure whatsoever, it&#x27;s a bit disingenuous to call it &#x27;your own money&#x27;. As an example, if your city pays for a big new park on your block and this increases the value of your property, is that increase really yours?<p>The whole issue of taxation is so much more complicated than &#x27;100% of my income is mine and any tax is essentially theft&#x27;. Much better to argue about taxation in terms of fairness in my opinion. In terms of fairness, property owners do much better out of the whole equation than it might first seem as every public improvement amounts to a tax refund in the form of increased property value. The poor might get obvious refunds or entitlements, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they are not equivalent.<p>In the above circumstance, the people with the most legitimate gripe are people paying a decent amount of income tax while owning no property and so missing out on both types of &#x27;refund&#x27;.\n\n    &gt; I think American culture has a weird fetish for fairness. We&#x27;ll do something that makes everyone worse off because at least it&#x27;s distributed evenly.<p>When you phrase it like that, it&#x27;s not really an American-specific thing. I remember reading about ethological studies on very young children - not in US! - where they would be given a bunch of candy to distribute in various contrived situations. One of those was picking between something like &quot;you get 1 candy and the other kid gets 1 candy&quot; vs &quot;you get 2 candies and the other kid gets 4 candies&quot;, and similar arrangements in larger groups. What they found is that there&#x27;s a very strong bias towards fairness, meaning that kids were pretty consistently willing to end up with less candy themselves if that means that another kid would not get an unfair share. Which, if you think about it, is not an unreasonable trait to evolve in a social species.\n\n  I&#x27;m not sure how you connect the first paragraph with the second.<p>&gt; American culture doesn&#x27;t like to think about how much of &quot;success&quot; is down to luck. [...] The idea of trying to make up for some of the luck factor by taking some from those with more and giving it to those with less is almost instinctively repugnant, even if it might lead to higher quality of life for everyone involved.<p>I don&#x27;t find charitable giving repugnant. I donate myself, even when there is no tax benefit to be gained. I don&#x27;t find conservative and prudently managed social safety nets repugnant either (by prudent, I have in mind social safety nets that are by design meant to help people get out of poverty, not become dependent on such a system by creating incentives to remain effectively poor). I also recognize that the common good does require more than just money (and I do recognize a common good, unlike weird, sociopathic hyperindividualists). And in times of <i>crisis</i>, I recognize that a rigid notion of private property is opposed to the common good; private property exists, after all, <i>for the sake of the common good</i>. If I had a warehouse of food during a famine, I would not view people taking amounts of food from that warehouse to allow them to survive as theft.<p>What I do find repugnant is what <i>seems</i> like the insinuation that my luck somehow means that others are entitled to what I have received through luck[0], and that my claim to such wealth is suspect. If I win the lottery, the notion that there is something unclean about receiving that wealth or bequeathing it to my children, because I was lucky, and others weren&#x27;t, or else I&#x27;m a bad person, is preposterous. It reeks of envy. So, unless I&#x27;ve earned something, others can just take it? I have no right to it? But they have a right to it? Unless I&#x27;ve earned something, I must feel insecure about having it? No, actually. If I have received something through luck, through gift, through merit, and I have done so without criminality, it is mine.<p>Now, if I did win the lottery, I would certainly give to charity. And if a competent state taxed me in a reasonable way to fund programs that genuine help lift the poor out of poverty, I have no issue <i>in principle</i>. And I would claim, that those who have surplus wealth beyond what is needed to fully support themselves and their families do well to use that surplus to aid the poor (the poor, mind you, not those who can make it on their own). I simply reject the notion that others can or should force me to do so. And when I have the freedom to decide on my own, I have the freedom to allocate money prudently.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newadvent.org&#x2F;summa&#x2F;1116.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newadvent.org&#x2F;summa&#x2F;1116.htm</a>\n\n  We don&#x27;t have to define basic necessities as &quot;success&quot;. We can all have them.\n\n  This is the main reason I&#x27;m drawn to Universal Basic Income (UBI). Give <i>everybody</i> a subsidy, regardless of their situation, and the cliff problem vanishes. If you never take away the subsidy, then there&#x27;s <i>always</i> an incentive to improve.\n\nDiversity needs the precondition of liberal democratic welfare support? Therefore, eliminate public goods like public housing to destroy diversity. Since diversity positively correlates to large populations and the tragedy of the commons.\n\nI wonder how many of those poor immigrants who live in this public housing to serve wealthy Parisians would prefer to live in something like an American suburb if they could get jobs there.\n\n  all of them\n\n  Probably none.

I can&#x27;t think of a single reason.\n\n    &gt; I&#x27;d rather be poor in Miami Beach or NYC than the EU. It has much better benefits than Romania.<p>Sorry I couldn&#x27;t help it. Comparing an EU member state to the US is akin to comparing a US state to the EU. These are big places and Paris and even France are a very, very small part. Europe has some real, real crappy places that really, really mess up Europe&#x27;s statistics. Once places like Bosnia and Ukraine get in, the stats will get even worse. I doubt Romanian and Ukrainian social spending is very high. Compare to US states and cities in you&#x27;re comparing EU states and cities, and comparable ones.\n\nWho is paying for all this?\n\nSingapore? 80% of public housing? true?\n\nHong Kong has some is highest skyscrapers next to housing that rents cages for people to sleep in: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bedspace_apartment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bedspace_apartment</a>\nPeople live in the same neighborhood and there is a cruelty factor of understanding and accepting that in your city poor people live in cages. And people in the US live in tents. At least nobody profits from that.\n\nPublic housing is terrible - why should the government steal my money (income tax) to pay to house criminals and drug dealers nearby which devalues my property and endangers my life and family?<p>We just need a true Free Market - let people build and invest how they want, where they want. And ensure that everyone has a stake in the property they own and the area they live in.\n\n  Because as a society we progress at the pace our weakest progress.<p>We don&#x27;t say China moved ahead because the rich got richer, but because it lifted hundred of millions from poverty.<p>And if anything, a poor social net tends to create more dangers, not less.<p>When people have no roof, no jobs, no help, they will turn into criminals. Hell if I need to eat, or worse, I need to feed my family, I could not care less about becoming a criminal too. Zero.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the dystopia of private neighborhoods with gates and security, the ghettos, the crumbling neighborhoods, endless tents anywhere you look in many major US cities.<p>We don&#x27;t want this in Europe.<p>I&#x27;d rather pay more taxes that help the weakest, not just taxes to punish them and send them to jail. A society with more desperate people makes my life worse, not better just because I can find a more isolated&#x2F;secure prison where I can avoid looking at them.\n\n    &gt;We don&#x27;t say China moved ahead because the rich got richer, but because it lifted hundred of millions from poverty.<p>I was under the impression the poor in China moved ahead due to working, not because the Chinese government subsidized their housing or other basics.  Although, the Chinese government did subsidize their ability to find and get to work via huge infrastructure projects.\n\n      China has always had planned housing welfare, it was the only way of building houses for decades.<p>Liberalized housing started in the 90s along the rest, but planned housing projects have kept existing and had huge budgets till the late 2010s. Even today around one in twenty development housing projects is still state funded.<p>Anyway, I was mostly talking about them as a society lifting more and more of the weakest. And yes, building houses has been a major contributor of this obviously as well as a stimulus for the economy.\n\n  why should the government steal my money (income tax) to pay to subsidize you driving around in and parking your private automobile, for every trip, everywhere, including in dense urban environments?\n\nI can&#x27;t pass the paywall but does it mention Paris is losing people? I was living in the 15th arrondissement and this family area turned into a violent zone in a couple of years as they put public housing everywhere. Drug dealers, violence at my kid school, theft... My street became a spot for druggies and I had to pass them with my kids. 15 minutes from the Eiffel tower...<p>I left this city 3 years ago and found safer land. All my friends did the same. There is no sane reason to stay in an area with so much violence.

This indicates that our ancestors were eating food that was already partly broken down by fermentation.&quot;<p>IIRC another interpretation of the smaller large intestine is that early humans were eating more bioavailable food (i.e. meat) than other primates, which doesn&#x27;t need to be broken down as much as more fibrous material (seeds, leaves, stalks etc).

(sausages etc)\n\n  Yeah not sure I understand the entire idea behind correctly.<p>To stick with other primates for now. Gorilla&#x27;s have an obscene amount of muscles; adults need 8000 calories per day, compared to 2000-3000 calories for an adult human.<p>Somewhere, even though they eat low bioavailable food, even though they had to eat all day the heave muscle guys &amp; girls had better chances of survival. Why do we think the brain&#x27;s need are more special then a feature like muscles? Am I missing something here?<p>There is a decent amount of unfermented and uncooked food with lots of nutritional value a smarter brain can find, mainly meats (fatty parts especially) &amp; nuts (if you are smart enough to open them), that would relatively on parr with the Gorilla way.<p>I&#x27;m sure as soon as tools, fire etc, became part of human culture it became even easier  for those with more intelligence to became favorable. But that also needed to be in line with the development of more complicated social structures, either genetically or culturally.\n\n    Generally, the great apes are better adapted to plant diets, humans are better adapted for eating meat. Gorillas eat leaves and pith, and A LOT of it.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2964658&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2964658&#x2F;</a>\n\n      Yes. But the parent commentor asked &quot;why&quot;.<p>As in: why can a gorilla sustain it&#x27;s immense needs to build muscles by eating a lot, but humans cannot do this to build a large brain?<p>To ask that question differently: why would humans need to change to meat&#x2F;fermentation&#x2F;cooking in order to grow brains, if they could &quot;just&quot; eat more, as other primates do?\n\n        Humans (since Erectus) _can&#x27;t_ eat more. We don&#x27;t have a big enough ingestion system for that. Our guts are tiny compared to other great apes. We&#x27;re completely unable to survive on what chimpanzees eat, not to mention gorillas.\nThe fire&#x2F;cooked food hypothesis (and now this speculative one about fermented food) is that it made it possible to greatly reduce the guts, as well as chewing muscles. More calories and better nutrients (both cooking and fermentation greatly improves the nutritional value of many foods), and less need of energy for guts is what&#x27;s supposed to be the driver here (and seafood has also been mentioned as a possible source of important amino acids which is necessary for brain development)\n\n          Sounds like &quot;standing up&quot; was the real pivotal moment.\n\n          but we can, you can perfectly fine live on raw meat (pork back fat)  nuts etc. And Guts also shrank because they could. It sounds to me like this part mostly came after we learned to cook, then the body didn&#x27;t need to waste energy on large complex guts. Hugely complicated brains such as Elephants &amp; Whales do just fine on raw food diets.\n\n            Erectus are about 2 million years old, and they already had &quot;our&quot; body shape.. i.e. small guts. The question has always been - did they already know how to cook? It&#x27;s somewhat early for fire control. But it is one of the arguments for the idea that fire&#x2F;cooking came much earlier than we have physical evidence for. This study&#x2F;idea about fermented food is exactly about this - if there wasn&#x27;t fire that early, could it have been fermentation?\n\n              Some of it makes sense.<p>The question why &amp; when humans gut could start to shrink. It seems more the other way around in my view, brain development helped develop cooking &amp; other preparation methods and in turn to the need for less complicated guts.\n\n          &gt; Humans (since Erectus) _can&#x27;t_ eat more<p>Again, the question is not if they can (they can&#x27;t) but WHY. Or, differently, what is the cause, and what the effect.\n\n            The cause is selective pressure and the effect is evolutionary change.\n\n          What do you mean? They eat mostly fruit and vegetables.\n\n            The top comment on this thread (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Could-a-human-being-survive-on-the-diet-of-a-wild-chimpanzee\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Could-a-human-being-survive-on-the-die...</a>) matches what I&#x27;ve learned about this elsewhere.  Just that &quot;chewing for six hours a day&quot; part is a problem..<p>As for gorillas - that&#x27;s mostly leaves, shoots and stems. All very hard to digest, a human wouldn&#x27;t get much nutrients out of that.\n\n              Sycamore figs are 100% edible, I think it&#x27;s the predominant species grown in more southern areas.\n\n                That&#x27;s fine, but you can&#x27;t survive only on Sycamore figs - and that&#x27;s the problem.\n\n        Spoken like you expect an answer when this is just incremental understanding. This is not a video game where we discover some tech tree humans followed and can then replicate that in say apes. Maybe Im reading too much into this? by seems like a-lot of screaming for why.\n\n    More probably the idea behind is some dill preserves company donated for the research.\n\n      Ah yes big pickle mucking with research...\n\n  The paper addresses that, the tl;dr is that there is no evidence for hunting from this time period and that scavenging wouldn&#x27;t have provided enough meat to make a substantial difference.<p>It&#x27;s of course entirely possible that both fermented foods <i>and</i> a meat diet were pivotal, just at very different time periods and in different contexts.\n\n  Yes, meat being the driver is the more common (and simpler) explanation for our smaller intestines and larger brains. I guess plantbasednews.org just accidentally left this alternative explanation out.<p>That said, fermented foods could very well have played a part in it.\n\n    Likely more accurate.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why anyone thinks any surviving development in an organism is due to this &quot;one weird trick&quot; thing, as opposed to a multitude of factors that rendered that organism fit for their environment, at least enough to pass said development on, anyway. Meat, fermented foods, fire, and a slew of other variables likely played a role.<p>Talking about evolution as though there was some single exploding popcorn kernel that caused change is a pretty narrow take on things. Sites like the one in the link only serve to perpetuate such shallow thinking on the matter, and in this case, likely to push a narrative.\n\n      <i>&gt; Talking about evolution as though there was some single exploding popcorn kernel that caused change is a pretty narrow take on things.</i><p>That’s kind of one of the predominant theories in evolution though: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Punctuated_equilibrium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Punctuated_equilibrium</a><p><i>&gt; Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.</i><p>The theory deals with the morphology of animals in the fossil record but that’s the gist of it: the actual evolution happens really fast, usually to adapt to a large environmental change, and species enter a stable state where they very slowly change if at all.\n\n        &gt; the actual evolution happens really fast<p>With the qualification, that they can be &quot;fast&quot; in geological time scales, which are rather big.

Did a shift to meat-eating, as suggested by Milton, permit this drastic reduction in colon size in the human lineage? Indeed, humans and members of the order Carnivora share a small colon size. However, the gut transit time in Carnivora is much faster than in humans. Although Milton postulates that this difference is due to our evolutionary history as plant eaters96, another explanation is that colon reduction follows from a reduced need to break down fibrous plant material within the digestive tract due increased bioavailability of nutrients before food is consumed—i.e., external fermentation (Fig. 1).<p>[…]&quot;<p>As for the affiliations:<p>I can&#x27;t find much on the obvious outlier among the author list, albeit I didn&#x27;t check for very long, only an old interview here which appears partially misleading NOT due to content but due to what seem like incorrect social media references:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voyageatl.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;meet-matthew-bagshaw-christi-hansen-hungry-heart-farm-dietary-consulting-south-metro&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voyageatl.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;meet-matthew-bagshaw-christi...</a><p>And an archive of their website:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190122012150&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hungryheartgeorgia.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190122012150&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hungr...</a><p>The work breakdown given at the end of the paper in the contributions section looks like the following:<p>&quot;K.L.B. and E.E.H. conceived the paper, K.L.B. and E.E.H. compiled data and analysis, K.L.B., E.E.H., and C.H. wrote the manuscript, with E.E.H. focusing on metabolic and nutrition components, E.E.H. on human evolution components, and K.L.B. on fermentation and culture components.

Unlike other animals we can almost eat everything.\n\n      We are not the only omnivores, but I think it is an underappreciated trait of humans.<p>I believe that a lot is written about what is a healthy diet, but in reality, as long as there is no obvious excess or deficiency, and you don&#x27;t have a specific disease, then any diet can be healthy. Vegan, carnivore, paleo, keto, kosher, whatever... even junk food. The human digestive system is very good at working with anything you throw at it.<p>The only thing is the less varied the diet, the more you need to care about potential deficiencies. Usually, there is a way, but unlike with a varied diet where you can rely on random sampling, you may need to be more explicit.<p>The psychological side is quite a bit more complex though. While a healthy diet is almost always possible from the point of view of our guts, we may not want to, because our natural incentives may not align with what modern society offers. What used to be rare is now abundant and easily accessible.\n\n        &gt; I believe that a lot is written about what is a healthy diet, but in reality, as long as there is no obvious excess or deficiency, and you don&#x27;t have a specific disease, then any diet can be healthy.<p>Except the SAD standard american diet.\n\n        &quot;healthy&quot; in that &quot;you won&#x27;t die&quot; -- not necessarily &quot;healthy&quot; as in &quot;ideal for maintaining peak health&quot;. That&#x27;s probably a bad comparison... But I&#x27;m not sure that you can count out the importance of the intestinal microbiome. It&#x27;s not just vitamins or metals--one can be deficient in beneficial bacteria as well. These bacteria are why we can &quot;throw anything&quot; at our intestines. That&#x27;s true until the good bacteria have nothing left to sustain them and die off.\n\n      There&#x27;s large parts of the food world that are completely inaccessible to humans.<p>Most plant material (i.e. &quot;fiber&quot;, digestible by e.g. cows), carion, most raw meat (if we ate what dogs ate, we&#x27;d have constant stomach issues...)\n\n        &gt;carion, most raw meat (if we ate what dogs ate, we&#x27;d have constant stomach issues...)<p>Humans have extremely acidic stomach acid (1.5 - 3.5 pH), close to that of vultures and dogs (1 - 2 pH).<p>Early humans and their predecessors, were very likely (at least partially) carrion feeders, and consumed raw meat for millions of years before they started cooking.\n\n          Fresh raw meat, yes. Not carrion.\n\n            Yes, early humans were likely carrion feeders among other dietary strategies. Archaeological and anthropological evidence suggests that before developing tools and techniques for hunting, early hominins would have scavenged carcasses left by predators. This behavior would have allowed them to access a high-quality source of nutrients like protein and fat, which are crucial for brain development.<p>The use of tools made from stones to break open bones for marrow and to possibly butcher animals suggests that early humans exploited carcasses that they found or scavenged from other predators&#x27; kills. Marrow and brain tissue, which could be accessed by breaking open bones and skulls, are highly nutritious and would have been valuable food sources for early humans.<p>Over time, as hominins developed more sophisticated tools and techniques, they likely became more efficient hunters, gradually shifting from scavenging to actively hunting for their food. However, the practice of scavenging would have played a critical role in the dietary habits of early human ancestors and contributed to their evolutionary success.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;bioscience&#x2F;article&#x2F;64&#x2F;5&#x2F;394&#x2F;2754213\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;bioscience&#x2F;article&#x2F;64&#x2F;5&#x2F;394&#x2F;2754213</a>\n\n              Thank you.\n\n    I&#x27;m curious, but knowing how to safely ferment foods would seem indicate that one has an advanced brain. Are there any examples of other primates fermenting thier food (lacto, not alcohol - alcohol shrinks brains)?\n\n      Nature causes various food sources to ferment which is exploited by many animals.\n\n        Like what? Usually lacto fermenting requires a specific salt level. I know fruit tends to ferment, but that produces alcohol, which is a negative factor for brains.\n\n          Lacto only requires a specific salt level to keep the bad bacteria out. I doubt caveman humans cared much about sanitary conditions. Also, I doubt the vessels they used would be air tight (except to expel gases) like the ones I use.<p>Modern humans have genes to process alcohol and some populations don’t have the gene (Asian flushing). Alcohol and fermented fruit were probably sources of calories and drinkable water for many populations.\n\n            &quot;Alcohol and fermented fruit were probably sources of calories and drinkable water for many populations.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m questioning how this could have preceeded the formation of advanced brains at a level to contribute to the formation of advanced brains.\n\n              There are tons of articles about monkeys routinely eating fermented fruits, so advanced brains aren&#x27;t required for that.<p>E.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.berkeley.edu&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;monkeys-routinely-eat-fruit-containing-alcohol-shedding-light-on-our-own-taste-for-booze&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.berkeley.edu&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;monkeys-routinely-eat-f...</a>\n\n            I bet they did care a great deal about food poisoning. A few days of vomiting and fever could be a death sentence.\n\n          human pathogens can&#x27;t live in alcohol.  so a low alcohol liquid would be sterile and healthy for humans.<p>brain health isn&#x27;t the big factor, it is outweighed by the not heaving out your guts by food poisoning.\n\n            &quot;human pathogens can&#x27;t live in alcohol. so a low alcohol liquid would be sterile and healthy for humans.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t true at all. Beer can go bad and give you food poisoning.\n\n              Bad Taste, not kill you.<p>There are a ton of other studies exploring how beer&#x2F;wine fermentation for alcohol also contributed to early human growth. Precisely because of this property.\n\n          &gt; a negative factor for brains<p>try telling that to the parrots in the trees, they&#x27;re a social animal and seem happy enough.\n\n        &gt; Nature causes various food sources to ferment which is exploited by many animals.<p>I did some searching and cannot find any evidence to support that.<p>Only the contrary, for instance: <i>Some non-human animals are documented to consume fermented foods, but it appears to be somewhat infrequent, and limited to a narrow range of foods.</i> from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fermentology.pubpub.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;2h9z1g3y\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fermentology.pubpub.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;2h9z1g3y</a><p>The article continues:<p><i>As a part of this unique relationship that humans have with fermented foods, it&#x27;s perhaps not surprising to learn that humans have some adaptations associated with the consumption of fermented foods. Now, these technically aren&#x27;t unique to humans. These are adaptations that are shared with African apes as well. In particular, there&#x27;s two genes that we know about that signal this kind of special relationship with fermented foods among the great apes.<p>The first is the ADH4 gene. We have a special variant of this gene. It&#x27;s an alcohol dehydrogenase gene. It basically lets us break down alcohol more effectively than many other primates. Alcohol is a byproduct of many types of fermentation. There are three major types of fermentation, two of which produce ethanol as a byproduct. Therefore, being able to break down ethanol provides us with an advantage in terms of being able to consume fermented foods.<p>The other gene is the HCAR3 gene. This gene codes for a receptor that&#x27;s thought to make humans and great apes more sensitive to signals that come from certain types of microbes, particularly Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus are one of the key groups of microbes that are involved in food fermentations. Together, these two genes suggest that there&#x27;s a kind of unique relationship between African apes and humans, and fermented foods.</i>\n\n        Don&#x27;t know why you were downvoted. We used to have a horse that would wait until the fallen apples were fermented, and then eat them to get drunk.<p>At least, that&#x27;s the human explanation. It&#x27;s more likely that she just preferred the taste of fermented apples and getting drunk was just a pleasant side effect.\n\n      The study speculates that accidental fermentation by stashing food in the same location is how such foods were introduced into the human diet\n\n    It could be both: Fermented meat from scavenging. Sounds gross but actually many cultures still have fermented meat products in their cuisine\n\n      &gt;Sounds gross but actually many cultures still have fermented meat products<p>Aged steak - a famous Western delicacy - is partially rotten meat.\n\n        Salami, chorizo, pepperoni.. are all fermented meats\n\n      It’s not outside the realms of possibility that the invention of fermented meats (which includes salami and other similar sausages) arose when humans decided to eat the intestines of hunted beasts, possibly well after they ate the more desirable portions.\n\n        Cultures have different definitions of what is the desirable portions. In some native american tribes the most desired cut of the bison was the raw liver with the contents of the gallbladder squirted on top.\n\n      There is an interesting series of scenes in the book Shogun where the main character gets some meat and wants to prepare it in the traditional manner by curing it.  He hangs the meat outside but people are so disgusted by the stench that they steal it and dispose of it before he can eat it.\n\n        Natto... funazushi... surely the Japanese should have appreciated stanky food just as much as a European.\n\n    Yes.  Could be both.<p>The problem is the simpler, &#x27;meat&#x27; based answer, leads people to say &quot;Brains grew big because eating meat, I think I&#x27;m going to pull up to the table and down a few pounds of ribs and wash it down with a nice brisket&quot;.\n\n      That&#x27;s my excuse :-)\n\n    It&#x27;s not just as simple as &quot;probably just meat&quot;. Of course meat is important but i&#x27;d say in light of recent research fermentation and gut flora related concepts would be a better guess.<p>Cutting edge research into the Gut Biome shows its overlooked significance, connected to pre and probiotics and food, but also mental health, even going as far as questioning how much of &quot;us&quot; are really the gut biome.<p>People can heal various ailments even mental disease by getting transplants, it&#x27;s a completely new and wild field of study, and holds much more weight than say eating or not eating meat.\n\n  Josef H. Reichholf, a German evolutionary biologist, writes that the first grain cultivations were not as nutritious and productive as they are today. His thesis is that grains were first used in fermentation – not for food, but alcohol consumption, along with other drug substances like poppy, betel nut, coca and others. Then, storage of these (luxury) goods reduced mobility of hunters and gatherers, which led them to settle down (still eating mostly a hunter and gatherer diet).<p>His book &quot;Warum die Menschen sesshaft wurden&quot; is summarized in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oe1.orf.at&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;213690&#x2F;Warum-die-Menschen-sesshaft-wurden\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oe1.orf.at&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;213690&#x2F;Warum-die-Menschen-sesshaf...</a><p>For a scientific journal reference, see &quot;The role of cult and feasting in the emergence of Neolithic communities.

Of course, this needs fire.\n\n  Why not just read the actual study, to which the article links, and discuss that?<p>&quot;One such proposed dietary change is increased meat eating, which has been argued to have been central to human evolution&quot;<p>Behold the long comment train on a tangent unrelated to the study.\n\n  &gt; IIRC another interpretation of the smaller large intestine is that early humans were eating more bioavailable food (i.e. meat) than other primates, which doesn&#x27;t need to be broken down as much as more fibrous material (seeds, leaves, stalks etc). Can someone more knowledgable than me confirm or deny?<p>Yep,  it&#x27;s also why the Giant Panda needs to eat so much bamboo in a day, they also have a carnivore-like short gastrointestinal tract.<p>The idea that humans were fermenting via persistent food caches a million years before we discovered fire, and doing it consistently enough to affect brain evolution is, well, a stretch.\n\n    Why?\n\n    Why is that a stretch? At a warm room temp fermentation is quite noticeable after 18 hours in a lot of raw edible plants. As little as 6-8 for some of them. You don&#x27;t need a cache, simply carrying leftovers with you for the next morning would be enough. It&#x27;s not a big stretch that a resource you would have to go alarmingly out of your way to avoid (by destroying edible food after gorging) would come before fire.<p>This is related to what I&#x27;ve heard called the carrier bag theory. Once you can acquire food, the next technological step is being able to bring it with you. A gourd, a large folded leaf is sufficient. Once you&#x27;re doing that fermentation is inevitable.\n\n      &gt; Why is that a stretch?<p>Because you need to do it over generations, so consistently that it effects the species evolution, selecting for a developing brain you can&#x27;t support without the fermentation.<p>Similar developments, such as lactose tolerance, required a society that had already domesticated lactating animals.\n\n        Yeah I get that, it still doesn&#x27;t seem like a big leap to me. Fermentation is just the early curve of the spoilage processes. All you need to exploit it is continued access to food you acquired recently.\n\n  It’s actually discussed in the paper.<p>&gt; Explanatory power compared to other hypotheses<p>&gt; The emergence of meat-eating, tuber-harvesting, and cooking have all been proposed to account for human brain expansion; why should our just-so story be given any additional credence?

It&#x27;s kind of a travel book in some ways.\n\n  It must have been something that predates arable farming (sowing seeds on acres), just timeline wise humanity spread before farming became a thing.<p>On the other hand I don&#x27;t think that this must be a one-factor kind of a game changer thing. I could totally think that two to three changes occured in the food chain (meat, starches, food preservation, improved social skills), that combined amplified each other&#x27;s effect and lead to the development.\n\nI wish the article lingered a bit more on how people might&#x27;ve been fermenting foods in the past as well as exploring what fermentable food options were available. It would be interesting to run some experiments storing various foods in different ecosystems over long periods of time. How falsifiable is their hypothesis?<p>This would&#x27;ve been mostly in the African continent, right? I&#x27;d imagine it would be hard to get consistent fermentation going in more tropical climates.\n\n  The excellent book <i>On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</i> (Harold McGee) has sections on major food groups, along with some incredible stories of how those foods have been preserved in the past — many of which involve some sort of fermentation. I recall one story about birds being encased inside a dead seal, which was then buried for a time (looking that up now, I think it&#x27;s Inuit &#x27;kiviak&#x27;). It&#x27;s a great book all around, if you&#x27;re interested in how food works.\n\n    I must be missing something. That sounds like encasing some rapidly rotting meat inside more rotting meat. A significantly less appealing turducken.<p>It would take some strong convictions to turn multiple meals now (seal + bird) into a future meal that could potentially be stolen by scavengers.\n\n      From wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  Up to 500 whole auks are packed into the seal skin, beaks and feathers included. As much air as possible is removed from the seal skin before it is sewn up and sealed with seal fat, which repels flies. It is then hidden in a heap of stones, with a large rock placed on top to keep the air out. Over the course of three months, the birds ferment, and are then eaten during the Arctic winter, particularly on birthdays and weddings.  \n</code></pre>\nThings were rough up there\n\n        Well...that is certainly something.<p>I am still bewildered as to how the method was discovered. Taking valuable seals and birds to run multi-month experiments does not seem like it would make you a popular fellow. Best case scenario, you discovered a way of making what sounds a vile, but technically edible, flesh paste.<p>The extended quote from the Wikipedia page notes some people have died from preparing it improperly<p><pre><code>  Polar explorer Knud Rasmussen&#x27;s death is attributed to food poisoning by kiviaq.[5][6] In August 2013 several people died in Siorapaluk from eating kiviak that was made from eider rather than auk. Eider does not ferment as well as auk, and those who ate it contracted botulism.[7]</code></pre>\n\n          <i>I am still bewildered as to how the method was discovered.</i><p>Hunting cultures often have periods of surplus.  Most likely this wasn&#x27;t so much deliberate fermentation as an attempt to store their surplus; the fact that it turned well was a happy accident.\n\n      Think about hakarl: icelandic rotten shark. It stinks to high heaven: I&#x27;m not kidding, a colleague brought a small sealed cup to the office and opened it. The whole floor (where 80+ people were seated) stank like crazy.<p>Regular shark meat is poisonous. But if you bury it in the sand and leave it for 6 weeks, the toxin decomposes and humans no longer die from it. But it stinks.<p>How hungry must have those Icelanders been that they tried this?\n\n        Well.. I tried it in Iceland. In a restaurant. Looked like rubber cubes, didn&#x27;t smell much, but unfortunately it tasted what it looked like (rubber).\n\n        &gt; Regular shark meat is poisonous<p>What kind of shark is that? I grew up eating salted shark meat and it was the only kind of fish I&#x27;d eat as a kid.\n\n    Check out the manga&#x2F;anime Moyashimon  if you haven&#x27;t already\n\n  Iru, fermented locust beans, come from Africa. Tempeh comes from Indonesia. Seems like most fermented foods prefer somewhat warm temperatures\n\n    I regularly make (grow) tempeh and koji and both require a food dehydrator to keep the temperature around 30°C for the duration of the fermentation (in my case, living in the Netherlands, so Western Europe). Both tempeh and koji are molds (mycelium that doesn&#x27;t produce mushrooms).<p>I also make milk kefir, water kefir, sourdough and kombucha and while none of these cultures require the higher temperatures, they do thrive in the higher temperatures.<p>I also grow quite a few species of mushrooms and have learned that a lot of species incubate quite aggressively at higher temperatures (25-35°C).\n\nFermented foods, especially yogurt, kefir, buttermilk are vital for good health. People buy probiotic pills etc. But all it takes is to buy a tub&#x2F;can of Greek yogurt. The best snack there is.<p>Medicine is food, food is medicine.\n\n  Less so, chocolate and salami\n\n    Don&#x27;t overdo the beer either\n\n  That really depends on the country. Some yogurts are very much dead where as in Switzerland they must be alive . Same thing with so many other items.\n\n    I keep hearing about this &quot;dead&quot; yogurt. What does this mean?\n\n      They make the yoghurt, then pasteurise it (I guess so it has a longer shelf life). So it tastes roughly like yoghurt but doesn&#x27;t have any of the good bacteria. I&#x27;ve also seen that sometimes lactobacteria are then artificially added back in so that they are present but in a controlled way.\n\n      Heat treating &#x2F; pasteurizing the yogurt after making it, kills the bacteria in it. Now the yogurt is &quot;dead&quot;. Actually it is the bacteria that are now dead.\n\n      It refers to whether the yogurt is alive or dead. It&#x27;s not exactly mysterious terminology.<p>You get yogurt by using bacteria to process milk. In order to do their processing, the bacteria need to be alive. So, for example, adding living yogurt to milk will get you more yogurt, but adding dead yogurt to milk will get you milk with some dead yogurt in it.\n\n        I agree it&#x27;s not mysterious. I was asking with some admittedly false naivety because if I&#x27;m being honest, I&#x27;m skeptical. I&#x27;ve only ever heard about this from people whose opinions on nutrition are dubious in other ways, and it&#x27;s usually phrased as something like &quot;all the yogurt you get from the store is dead.&quot; I eat yogurt every day and I sometimes make my own (using commercial yogurt as a starter), and I&#x27;ve never had a batch fail to start. Apparently I&#x27;ve only ever bought the live stuff.\n\n      For maximum benefit, the bacterial culture that transformed the milk into yogurt should still be active&#x2F;living.\n\n      A quick rule of thumb is that if the alleged yoghurt does not need to be stored refrigerated it is a &quot;dead&quot; yoghurt — i.e. not allowed to be marketed as a yoghurt in many markets.<p>Whether or not refrigerated yoghurt-ish products are live or not is another question. If you live in a jurisdiction which restricts the term &quot;yoghurt&quot; to products containing live cultures, you can rely on whether or not the refrigerated product uses the term in its description. Otherwise I have no idea.\n\n  Have you tried fermented fish? It was very good when I tried it. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prahok\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prahok</a><p>I would imagine you are also getting omega-3 from the fish.\n\n    Come, eat shark. Shark good. Shark make brain big.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H%C3%A1karl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H%C3%A1karl</a>\n\n      I dunno if brain gets big, but leg muscle will get stronger when you run away from ghe smell.\n\n  In certain countries like India and Sri Lanka, fermented rice and lentil cakes (Idli) are extremely popular too as a healthy vegetarian option that is good for the gut.\n\n  You don&#x27;t need to have &#x27;greek&#x27; yogurt for this. What folks call &#x27;greek&#x27; yogurt is really just strained yogurt (you can do this yourself with regular, plain yogurt). Any yogurt with the live bacteria in it will do.\n\nThis is a conjecture, not a study.<p>Sorry if that seems to be nitpicking, but I see too many &quot;studies&quot; like this. A study is supposed to report the truth of something that the author studied.<p>But this is an idea that the author liked and explored, and then wrote up.<p>Maybe we can keep calling these studies, and come up with another term for fact based studies. And not &quot;theory&quot; please, that word in a scientific context just confuses everyone.<p>Edit: &quot;research paper&quot; might be a good name (I saw someone else call it that in a post). i.e. &quot;Research paper posits&#x2F;theorizes&#x2F;suggests that Fermented .....&quot;<p>Also the paper itself doesn&#x27;t call itself a study, it calls itself an article.\n\n  That is not at all how science works. Outside of Mathematics, there is no such thing as Truth, only conjectures of varying certainties.<p>Also, research journals are really just fancy forum boards where researchers in a particular fields talk to each other, and even occasionally shit talk. They aren&#x27;t ever supposed to be a source of truth, and in fact the first thing we learnt as grad student is how to critically read a research journal article and try to poke holes in the study. We are supposed to assume that the articles are wrong, until we can be convinced that they are likely to be correct.<p>Sometimes I think Google Scholars is a mistake. The general public aren&#x27;t supposed to be exposed to research literature.\n\n    If I report that &quot;I did this, and then this happened&quot;. That&#x27;s close enough to the truth to call it that. It&#x27;s available in not just Mathematics: Chemistry, Physics for example.<p>Then you have the type: &quot;I saw this interesting thing&quot;, and that&#x27;s also close enough to the truth. Geology, Astronomy, Archeology are examples.<p>That&#x27;s a study.<p>But if I look at my own navel and decide &quot;I like this idea because it makes sense to me&quot;, that&#x27;s not a study. That type should get a different name. Theoretical Physics is the high quality version of this.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no value in this type of thing!! Just that it&#x27;s not a study.<p>Maybe call them &quot;research papers&quot;.<p>&gt; Sometimes I think Google Scholars is a mistake. The general public aren&#x27;t supposed to be exposed to research literature.<p>Yikes!!! So basically you want people to be sheep and just listen to what they are told, with no access to underlying material?<p>I&#x27;d rather people look at the source, and understand it poorly, vs not look at it at all.\n\n      &gt; If I report that &quot;I did this, and then this happened&quot;. That&#x27;s close enough to the truth to call it that. It&#x27;s available in not just Mathematics: Chemistry, Physics for example.<p>No. It&#x27;s when someone else does &quot;this&quot; and reproduces the result only using your article, only then that&#x27;s close to truth.\n\n  This study strikes me as promotional material with a science flavour.  It helps foster the desire for fermented food, ie its a means to shift premium product off shelves.  I fancy some kimchi or kefir myself, having read it!<p>Unfortunately, I think even serious studies have this flaw (of being beholden to funding).  The person or group providing the funding need to get a return on their investment.  Ie even those more serious studies are a form of conjecture, with only a subset of data being approached, or some important element being excluded.\n\n    &gt; It helps foster the desire for fermented food, ie its a means to shift premium product off shelves.<p>Sorry but this sounds disingenuous to me. Isn&#x27;t one of the hallmarks of fermented foods that you can prepare them at home, fairly cheaply in lots of cases? It is to me...\n\n      There are books, kits, jars, drinks, restaurants.  And you can buy fermented foods in shops too.\n\n        Okay I understand what you mean now (still don&#x27;t agree). I&#x27;m having a hard time envisioning companies involved in the fermented foods scene coming together and &quot;lobbying&quot; to push their &quot;agenda&quot; but who knows, maybe I&#x27;m being naive! ;-)\n\n          Imo, that&#x27;s all there is.  Money drives everything.\n\n    Are you suggesting the study was funded by an entity that sells fermented foods? The authors of the study stated there were no competing interests.\n\n      That is what is declared.  But we really don&#x27;t know who funds the studies, what conditions the money comes with, or will be withdrawn under, whether the conditions are even stated, etc.<p>However, I see:<p>&gt; Hungry Heart Farm and Dietary Consulting, Conley, GA, USA<p>&gt; Christi Hansen<p>Which doesn&#x27;t sound like a university.\n\nI make fermented fizzy enzyme drinks at home all the time, no soft drinks anymore. It has to be all the time as it is a perpetual drink. You buy on of those fancy hipster live enzyme drinks, but you never finish it. Just and juice, sugar, jam - whatever what bacteria like and it continues fermentation. At room temperature. Every two days it is ready again, drink it, feed it. If it is too active, put it in a fridge. I try to spread it as people have forgotten this.\n\n  In the Netherlands it&#x27;s called water and kefir. Good stuff indeed, especially during summer and basically free at the cost tapwater. No plastic packaging either! Those hipster might actually be onto something ;)\n\n    Kombucha is another one.\n\n      I nearly poisoned myself making kombucha at home, despite careful sanitizing and careful monitoring of pH and temperature. As a result I&#x27;m really not fond of casual recommendations to brew kombucha. Seems easy to mess up.\n\n        Counter anecdote for neutrality, I brew Kombucha and have done for a few years, worst I&#x27;ve done is make vinegar, YMMV\n\n          In 20 years a study will tell us how that increases the risk of cancer.\n\n        Can you elaborate, what happened and how did you notice? I also do Kombucha weekly.\n\n          By poisoned I mean food poisoning. Not sure what happened in the batch I made but drinking the brew gave me cold sweats and fever for two days and I emptied my bowels multiple times. So I stopped there. I still love the flavor, and I love most fermented food.\n\n            I would bet money it was something else. Fermentation usually does a good job of keeping bad fungi out. If you were careful with sanitation, it was something else like bad leftovers or something. Also, food poisoning usually takes &gt; 24-48 hours to kick in. So if you drank it and got sick that day, it was something you ate the day or two before.\n\n              It was a while back so I can&#x27;t retell exactly what my day had been but I remember it was unambiguous and it was definitely the kombucha.\n\n              &quot;If you were careful with sanitation&quot; is probably the important caveat. But have to keep in mind the potential danger when mess up making food. It is possible that kombucha is easier to mess up than most fermented food or cooking in general. I know beer making is very forgiving of sanitation, and isn&#x27;t dangerous if mess up.<p>The speed of food poisoning can be hours for some pathogens. It depends on the pathogen and the amount, and if the body detects the bad food and expels it quickly.\n\n            Oh okay got it, thanks! I also get that quite a few times, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s more food-related, as on those days I didn&#x27;t drink the booch. But now I know what to look out for, thanks!\n\n        Poisoned from what?\n\n        How were you poisoned? What happened to your kombucha?<p>When I make kombucha I am quite careless in the process, but it always turns out fine.\n\n        Explain this story better, please.\n\n        I ferment a lot, and know of only a few dangers: some rare fruits or veggies can produce toxins when fermenting, but non that I can easily buy in a European market. Spices and some herbs can be dangerous too, but the quantities needed for toxin levels that pose a danger, are insane.<p>Fungi are more dangerous. If something starts growing hair, it&#x27;s out.<p>Dairy fermentation is more dangerous ¹, and quite hard, so I avoid that.<p>Alcohol is obviously a toxin too, and rather common in fermentation ;)<p>In nearly all cases, I&#x27;ll trust one of the best fine tuned measurement devices to protect humans from toxins: my taste and nose.<p>(Q: how do you know the milk is beyond it&#x27;s expiry date? A: Smell it! Far more reliable than a date printed on some package)<p>¹<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6356804&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6356804&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: another thing to be careful with, are kernels, pits, seeds and peels. Peels can often contain lots of sprayed on chemicals that will probably kill your fermenting bacteria. Pits and kernels can contain insane amounts of toxins that we usually won&#x27;t eat because they are enclosed. But crushing&#x2F;long fermenting might release them\n\n          <i>&gt; Alcohol is obviously a toxin too, and rather common in fermentation ;)</i><p>Also watch out for methanol. Fruit pectin gets fermented into methanol so using pectase is recommended to break it down, especially if one ferments citrus juice.\n\n        America&#x27;s Test Kitchen had a very recent video on Kombucha, and in one portion[1], after showing the viewers the recipe and tools they used, show us how they gave their colleagues the exact same setup but ended up with varied results.<p>If people whose day job IS testing food recipes, all end up with different results from the master recipe made by their colleague, then it indicates certain external factors need to be controlled to ensure consistency.<p>The factor they narrowed down to, was consistency of temperature, and the solution they offered was to suggest a temperature-controlled box to ensure best results.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_e9ejoiLNlo?t=558\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_e9ejoiLNlo?t=558</a>\n\n      Kombucha is a con.\n\n  &gt;fizzy enzyme drinks<p>Do you mean kombucha? Kefir?\n\n    No, I mean enzyme drink. They are called differently all over the place. They are similar to kombucha, just without all that disgusting shroom in a jar thing.\n\n      Wait until you learn where the enzymes come from\n\n        No, kvass and other &#x27;fizzy drinks&#x27; are not kombucha<p>They get their fermentation from the air, ferment much lower, and do not rely on the skoby to keep it all working.  On some level there is similarities, but its not the same\n\n          It&#x27;s still &quot;shroom in a jar&quot;. Kvass is made with yeast, which are fungi.\n\n    One that&#x27;s very easy to make is bread kvass : basically just toasted bread, sugar and some yeast, either sourdough starter or regular bread yeast. It kinda tastes like a weak wheat beer. I assume with some hops it would taste even more like beer.\n\n      I love ginger and one easy one is ginger ale. Simply boiled ginger with sugar and after it cools add baker&#x27;s yeast, bottle and let it ferment a few days. I started out using wine yeasts, but after it occurred to me that it was only going to ferment for 2-3 days (after that the yeast eats all the sugar and you lose a lot of the flavor) so I just started using whatever baking yeast I had on hand.<p>Deliciously alcoholic.\n\n  &gt; whatever what bacteria like<p>How do you know what it likes?\n\n    Same thing as humans like, sugar.\n\n  Interesting! How can you tell it&#x27;s too active? It gets bubbly?\n\nFermentation is just one kind of preservation. It seems to me that preserving food has a larger impact on individual survival by promoting group survival, than does any speculative benefit to individual gut health specifically tied to fermentation.\n\n  Me too -- Think about what a boon stored calories would be vs all your food rotting every few days and having to worry about getting more would be.\n\nHere is the original research paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s42003-023-05517-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s42003-023-05517-3</a>\n\n  And this is just a &quot;External Fermentation Hypothesis&quot;\n\nIn Vino Veritas\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slova.org.ru&#x2F;blok&#x2F;neznakomka&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slova.org.ru&#x2F;blok&#x2F;neznakomka&#x2F;</a>\n\nmy take based on several such articles. 8-10M ago humans (big apes that we were back then) got the ability to metabolize alcohol, ie. all those plentiful of fermenting&#x2F;rotting fruit on the ground became food. That in particular allowed for less tree climbing, more walking on the floor. That, in particular for the purposes of self-defense and body calories storage - to more body mass - that in turn to less tree climbing, more walking (posture change, hands more &quot;handy&quot;). How far the walking? Well, about 2M ago (clocked by the divergent mutations in the tapeworm shared by hyenas and humans, and which has a lifecycle stage in antelope&#x2F;gazelle) humans got additional powerful energy source - started to scavenge carcasses in savannah, ie. meat eating. That naturally led to the tools (more specifically - weapons) use - hyena has teeth, yet we had hands and the bones to be used as a weapon were right were so to speak. Sticks and stones would do to. Hyenas chances weren&#x27;t good. Pack of hyenas - well, we were also walking the savannah not alone. So the tools(weapons) usage, pack&#x2F;tribal organization, energetic food source - that all leads to brain development as well as enabled and improved by such a development. Other fermented foods, food storage and fire seems to be seemingly important points associated with improved tools, social organization and associated brain development.\n\n  Very interesting theory. Do we know what types of fruits they would have been eating off the ground?<p>Also wondering if alcohol metabolization can be traced in dna or similar to align this theory.\n\n    yes, it is DNA tracing, for example (and note - &quot;increasing terrestrialization&quot;):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8308604&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8308604&#x2F;</a><p>&quot;Paleogenetic reconstruction of alcohol dehydrogenase genes across the hominid phylogeny indicates a dramatically enhanced catabolic capacity in one particular ADH (ADH4, as encoded by the ADH7 allele), starting at about 10 Mya [26]. ADH4, although only one of multiple ADH forms present in mammals, is found primarily in the mouth and digestive tract and thus effects the “first pass” at the digestion of ethanol. This enzyme became dramatically better at metabolizing ethanol following the phyletic split between the lineage leading to modern orangutans and to the other great apes, including ourselves. It thus correlates well with increasing terrestrialization among the African apes, possibly yielding greater access to fermenting fruit crops on the ground, and thus resulting in increased ethanol within the diet [26]. &quot;\n\nI&#x27;m thinking they ate partially digested and fermented food in their preys stomachs.\n\n  Never thought about it, but that makes decent sense\n\nIt&#x27;s not long now before some celebrity chef starts knocking out recipe books featuring fermented giraffe and describing it as a &quot;true Paleo&quot; diet.\n\nreminds me of high meat<p>recently learned that you need nitric oxide, and when you don&#x27;t eat veggies, you can still get it from salami, which is fermented meat.<p>Also trying to make garum these days, will take half a year until it&#x27;s done though.\n\n  If you are referring to sodium nitrite which is used (as part of curing salt) to preserve meats. Its also not terribly healthy in foods IIRC (of course its healthier to eat cured meat than to eat meat with Botulinum bacteria).\n\n    Nitrites in vegetables, unintuitively, aren’t bad for you whereas the ones in salami are, indirectly.<p>The problem isn’t nitrates and nitrites themselves though, but rather what’s present when they’re digested. Something has to convert nitrates to nitrites, or you need to consume nitrites, then something has to activate the nitrites into something harmful.<p>With meat, the presence of haem for example allows for the formation of a type of N-nitroso compound (nitrosylated-haem in this case) which is cancer-causing. Vegetables don’t tend to come with such compounds, but actually come with compounds which inhibit the development of harmful nitrite-based compounds. Most of these are antioxidants.<p>This doesn’t mean it’s impossible for vegetable-derived nitrites to harm you. It’s just far, far less likely.<p>Fried meat that was previously cured is by far the most dangerous source of these cancer-causing compounds. The most well known example is probably bacon.\n\n      could you just use sodium nitrate to salt your food? Like once a week or so?<p>edit: need=use\n\n        No, they&#x27;re quite different from each other. NaCl (Sodium Chloride) functions as a flavour enhancer whereas NaNO3 (Sodium Nitrate) functions to preserve foods (among other non-culinary uses). The concentrations of NaNO3 used for food preservation are far lower (and strictly regulated in much of the world) than we normally use for flavouring foods when using NaCl.<p>The flavour profiles are different, and the limits for consumption are much different as well. Too much of both is dangerous, but too much NaNO3 is arguably easier to reach and more harmful in the short and long term. NaNO3 can lead to immediate issues with hemoglobin production for example. In the longer term, high volumes are carcinogenic.<p>Your primary concern with NaCl is managing safe blood pressure in the longer term, and in the shorter term, it&#x27;s relatively easy to avoid toxicity or other more minor complications like dehydration.\n\n          Thanks! I think im not getting enough nitrate&#x2F;nitrite. Im pretty allergic to plants so i wondered about this\n\n            Ah, that’s really interesting. It might be worth talking to a doctor about how to dose that safely. It you consume it without activating foods, I suspect it could be safe. Perhaps that’s a good way to get some into your diet? Similar to a supplement taken on its own, just always without food (meat in particular).\n\n              my doctor is no help, sadly. Just sitting there, no suggestions or anything - I wonder if it&#x27;s me and I&#x27;m too pushy with my own ideas\n\n&gt; We close with suggestions for empirical tests.<p>Oooook. Call me when you have some of those.<p>This is just complete conjecture, and while interesting, isn’t a study. It’s a postulation.\n\nIt&#x27;s beer, isn&#x27;t? Completely makes sense...<p>If they find evidence that the next step was caffeine, I have no more questions...\n\n  well kimchi and kombucha for breakfast\n\nI eat natto (fermented soy beans) every day. It&#x27;s probably the cheapest and most healthy food you can buy in Japan. I used to hate the smell and texture, but force myself enough times made me gradually enjoy it.\n\n  What benefits does it have over other fermented soy products that actually taste good like miso or shoyu, or Chinese dou chi?\n\n    Not GP. One of the benefits that I’ve read about is that natto is a very good source of Vitamin K (542% of DV). [1]<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Natt%C5%8D#Nutrition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Natt%C5%8D#Nutrition</a>\n\n  Strange question, perhaps, but I&#x27;m curious because I always wanted to try Nattō:<p>If you eat it regularly, do you also smell like it?<p>I ask because people who eat a lot of garlic (or masala spice) often have strong body odor due to consuming these spices.\n\n    I notice the smell a bit. Not sure if anyone else notices my body odor changing. It&#x27;s pretty common to eat it here in Japan. Do you mean the odor clinging to clothes or some physiological smell change?\n\n  Natto looks somewhat.. strange. But I got used to it very quickly, I absolutely love rice with natto on top. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed much smell.\n\nDupe from a biased source. Better link and previous discussion at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39469988\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39469988</a>\n\nThe source can obviously biased. I became a vegetarian recently for ethical reasons and the critiques I receive around me center solely on health issues, with the occasional &quot;we are humans, we eat meat!&quot;. These have absolutely no bearing on the ethics of vegetarianism or veganism. I understand people want solid arguments from different perspectives, but for me, they are useless.\n\nOr, perhaps it was both? The combo would be something that is unique to the species, yes? Fire (via meats) supplied certain nutritional advantages. Fermentation increased guts bacteria, which we are finding has broader impact on the system that is the human body.<p>Is don&#x27;t understand the obcession with making everything binary, and then from there having to have a single winner take all assumption.\n\nThis study mentions what&#x27;s briefly said in &quot;Fantastic Fungi&quot; 2019 documentary: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netflix.com&#x2F;fi-en&#x2F;title&#x2F;81183477\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netflix.com&#x2F;fi-en&#x2F;title&#x2F;81183477</a><p>Apart from this, when I was a teenager, I remember I read in  a Belgian scientific magazine called &quot;Athena&quot; that studies confirmed  red meat to be the key to our ancestor&#x27;s brain evolution.\n\n&gt; &quot;Reduced gut sizes could only evolve if our ancestors were able to exploit a more nutrient-dense and easily digestible food source,”<p>I&#x27;ve been eating more fermented, marinated and pickled stuff lately and while it&#x27;s nutritious, it&#x27;s not very calorie-dense - hard to imagine something like this supplying enough energy to power a large brain.\n\n  I think the argument is that your fermented cabbage is more nutrient dense (or your body is better able to process the nutrients) than regular cabbage.\n\n  It keeps too -- I think you would always waste some&#x2F;have extra food unless you&#x27;re starving. If you can turn that into non rotten calories, now I don&#x27;t have to work on calorie getting tomorrow as much and we can try to figure out fire, pottery, whatever.\n\n  &gt;it&#x27;s not very calorie-dense<p>&gt;Reduced gut sizes could only evolve<p>Well maybe with a less calorie-dense diet the reduced gut sizes would make it easier to fit into the slimmer-fitting jeans and shirts ;)\n\nfermented foods&#x2F;beverages are more acidic and therefore should aid with digestion. In ancient Mesopotamia they drank beer with most meals, what if that wasnt <i>only</i> because it was safer than water, but also aided you to digest the foods you did eat, faster?\n\n  My understanding is that in those early agricultural mesopotamian societies the lines between beer, bread, and porridge were very blurry by modern standards. They didn&#x27;t so much drink beer with meals as drink a thick, sludgy beer <i>as</i> meals. And that was valued because the malting step increased the availability of the calories.<p>They also had more familiar-to-us breads, as well as unfermented cooked grain gruels. Again though which of these things you call bread and which beer is a value judgement. Some of the porridges could be drunk and some of the beers thick enough to eat with a spoon.\n\nFrom the &quot;about us&quot; page:<p>&gt; Plant Based News is a mission-led impact media platform focused on elevating the plant-based diet and its benefit to human health, the planet, and animals.<p>And<p>&gt; The world’s leading scientists agree that time is running out in the fight to stop the climate crisis. Shifting away from an animal-based food system is one of the most impactful ways we can slow global warming. It’s also a critical move in preventing future pandemics and bringing equity to our global food system.<p>I&#x27;ll take it with a grain of vegan salt.\n\n  This summary article may be biased, but note that the cited paper has been peer reviewed and was published in Nature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s42003-023-05517-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s42003-023-05517-3</a>.\n\n    Shouldn&#x27;t that be the article reference then? Since that is both the source and not biased.\n\n    It not a study. It’s a bunch of postulation and no data or experiment and based entirely on conjecture.\n\n      As is the idea that fire enabled us to boost our nutrition enabling brain growth.<p>I have no problem with the paper in Nature, and no problem with PBN promoting it. I think they’re overreaching saying it was fermentation not fire. It \nmay well have been both. Fire 2m years ago and fermentation more recently once we had containers to ferment things in.\n\n        Well I think it’s awesome to have the discussion and I certainly think the idea has merit… I just don’t think postulations should have the same weight as substantive research no matter how prestigious the journey it gets published in.<p>That’s really the core of my point.<p>You could very well be right on fire &#x2F; ferment and whatnot. We have so very little substantive paleontological information to go off of.\n\n  What are you calling them out for? A bias against torture and violent industrialized murder of sentient life?\n\n    There is more to eating meat than supporting industrial &quot;murder&quot;. And to be frank, industrial agriculture ain&#x27;t much better for animals and the Earth.<p>One can reduce their impact on this planet without becoming a (hypocrite) zealot, unless you can convince me you don&#x27;t have a car, avoid any form of plastics, avoid pesticides, avoid processed vegan food, do not import avocadoes, natto and tofu from overseas etc.<p>We can both play this game, or we can be just a little more pragmatic and a little less dogmatic.\n\n      Ah yes, the ideal solution fallacy.\n\n      It seems like you&#x27;re angrily describing an ideal that you would be ecstatic to achieve, but have no confidence you could ever reach. Just the fact that you _know_ what is hypocrisy (e.g. imported avocados) is a move in the right direction. Without a sense of the ideal, how could you be pragmatic? I think there will always be a vanguard of humanity that is willing to push towards the ideal -- that drags the rest of us pragmatists kicking and screaming into the future.\n\n      &gt; There is more to eating meat than supporting industrial &quot;murder&quot;.<p>99% of the meat grown in America comes from factory foods. Despite this, every time the horrible treatment of animals is brought up online all of a sudden everyone is getting their meat from farms where the cows get a message twice a day. Statistically, there isn&#x27;t much more. I still eat meat, very little these days, but lets be honest about it. Your final &#x27;whataboutisms&#x27; don&#x27;t help either. None of that matters. The truth about meat in America, at least, is undeniable.\n\n        I don&#x27;t reside in the US, but I highly doubt it is 99%. There are always ways of getting organic or poultry food.<p>At the very least in the EU there is no shortage of it and the legal restrictions are strictly enforced.<p>Anyway, you are doing yourself a favour not ingesting mass-production. There is a very very good reason virtually no country wants to import US-chicken.\n\n          Might not be literally 99% but it is close. You can’t find organic meat at restaurants and the price of organic meat at the grocery reserves it for special occasions or for people with enough disposable income (1%) to afford it.\n\n    No. As you obviously know by the phrasing of your question, the issue is that the vegan community has a particular history of agenda over science, and the concern is that any group that starts with a conclusion will build research to support their agenda rather than create objective evidence.\n\n      Agenda over science? What? It isn’t anti-science to be against eating meat because of its role in climate change. To think otherwise would be anti-science.\n\n        &gt; Agenda over science?<p>The person you are responding to is right. The anti-meat&#x2F; pro-plant position may not have direct industry ties, but the bias is evident in several ways, of which I&#x27;ll present just a few:<p>---<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;2759201\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;27592...</a><p>&gt; But what has for the most part been overlooked is that Katz and THI and many of its council members have numerous industry ties themselves. The difference is that their ties are primarily with companies and organizations that stand to profit if people eat less red meat and a more plant-based diet. Unlike the beef industry, these entities are surrounded by an aura of health and wellness, although that isn’t necessarily evidence-based.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peakhuman.libsyn.com&#x2F;dr-david-klurfeld-on-meat-not-causing-cancer-bogus-vegetarian-scientists-and-balanced-nutrition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peakhuman.libsyn.com&#x2F;dr-david-klurfeld-on-meat-not-c...</a><p>- Dr. David M Klurfeld] was on the World Health Organization working group to decide if meat causes cancer in 2015 with a bunch of vegetarians and vegans and says it was the most frustrating professional experience of his life\n- There were 22 scientists - half of which were epidemiologists\n- They claimed they used 800 studies but they actually only used 18\n- There was a group of people that were strongly against the vote\n- He thinks a number of the people made up their minds before they even arrived<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jilliansnutritionnook.com&#x2F;plant-based-to-meat-based-a-dietitians-story&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jilliansnutritionnook.com&#x2F;plant-based-to-meat-based-...</a><p>&gt; Looking back I think there were many factors that shaped my previously held stance on nutrition. I believe my education set me up to be susceptible to a plant-based diet. I was educated that too much red meat is not good. I was educated to value fruits and vegetables over meat. With this mind set, I was predisposed into believing red meat was bad for me and that the only animal protein (if any) I should eat was chicken and fish. I became further disgusted by red meat through documentaries and books with a vegan agenda. Red meat causes climate change, red meat decreases our life expectancy, red meat is morally bad. This pushed me further away from red meat and meat in general. I became more focused on this ideology of health rather than listening to my own body. Without me even realizing it, I began to shape my identity around a plant-based diet. It was really hard for me to break up with this idea of what I thought was healthy and it took me months of self-education to open up my eyes.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2077-1444&#x2F;9&#x2F;9&#x2F;251\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2077-1444&#x2F;9&#x2F;9&#x2F;251</a><p>&gt; The emphasis on health ministry within the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) movement led to the development of sanitariums in mid-nineteenth century America. These facilities, the most notable being in Battle Creek, Michigan, initiated the development of vegetarian foods, such as breakfast cereals and analogue meats. The SDA Church still operates a handful of food production facilities around the world. The first Battle Creek Sanitarium dietitian was co-founder of the American Dietetics Association which ultimately advocated a vegetarian diet. The SDA Church established hundreds of hospitals, colleges, and secondary schools and tens of thousands of churches around the world, all promoting a vegetarian diet. As part of the ‘health message,’ diet continues to be an important aspect of the church’s evangelistic efforts. In addition to promoting a vegetarian diet and abstinence from alcohol, the SDA church has also invested resources in demonstrating the health benefits of these practices through research. Much of that research has been conducted at Loma Linda University in southern California, where there have been three prospective cohort studies conducted over 50 years. The present study, Adventist Health Study-2, enrolled 96,194 Adventists throughout North America in 2003–2004 with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Adventist Health Studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet is associated with longer life and better health.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aleph-2020.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;introducing-narrative.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aleph-2020.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;introducing-narrativ...</a><p>&gt; Dietary policies, mass media, and activists increasingly portray plants as mostly beneficial and animal source foods (ASFs) as mostly harmful. Yet, both sides of this poorly informative plant&#x2F;animal binary represent heterogeneous food groups, which can be either benign or harmful from an ethical, environmental, or health perspective. It is not helpful to base policies on such simplistic categorization, which derives from reductionist approaches to nutrition, distortions by journalists, societal anxieties, and various forms of bias.\n\n  I am not sure what do you mean to say. This looks very transparent and consistent. A company that has clear values and transparently states them in its &quot;About Us&quot; page, explaining what they believe in and why they exist. What is to take with a grain of salt?\n\n    Disclosing your (potentially conflicting) interests does not automatically mean you&#x27;ve not been biased&#x2F;incentivized to discover particular findings, pharmaceutical research is full of examples\n\n      Of course, but if you have a specific interest, and then a study comes out that backs it up, you can write about it and promote it, can&#x27;t you? Show everyone, look at this, we liked this idea, and now this study gives it more backing.\n\n        If the study had said eating meat was essential for our pre-historic development they probably just wouldn’t publish it. Impartiality is hard.\n\n          Sure. \nBut there are plenty of &quot;Carnivore&quot;, or &quot;Keto&quot; sites that do not publish studies showing the benefits of fiber or vegetables. It goes both ways, the plant people aren&#x27;t more biased.<p>If a study comes out saying meat is great, &quot;keto&quot; sites promote it.<p>If a study comes out saying plants are great, &quot;plant&quot; sites promote it.<p>I don&#x27;t think a site called &#x27;plantbasednews&#x27; is hiding their bias.\n\n            Yes that’s why I would prefer studies done by some history department which at least theoretically is only biased towards finding out the truth\n\n              I think the point is, that the study itself was fine, you can&#x27;t discount it because you don&#x27;t like the sites that report on it.  The site that is &#x27;biased&#x27; is reporting on a study that backs up what they want to promote,  but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the underlying study. They didn&#x27;t fund this study, and put pressure on skewing the results, they are just writing an article about it.\n\n        Sure you can, but the thing about ideologies is that they are almost always pseudo-religious philosophies, and those entities that make them their foremost identity typically seek out supporting facts while ignoring contravening facts. Expecting this behavior is reasonable, almost all ideologues engage in it to some degree. Thus additional skepticism&#x2F;verification is warranted when the source is an ideologue and the purported argument contains facts that supposedly validate their ideology.<p>Even Trump says something correct about the border every once in a while, but you&#x27;d be a fool to take him at face value.<p>By contrast a more neutral source that lacked said motivation could be taken more at face value.  By putting your agenda out in front, you&#x27;re implying that you prioritize that agenda over everything else, including most likely the actual truth, because agendas become less and less politically attractive the more nuance they try to convey.\n\n          It was an article in &#x27;plantbasednews&#x27;, about a totally separately funded study that had a positive result for &#x27;plants&#x27;.<p>This is a site to report &#x27;plant based news&#x27;, reporting on a study about &#x27;plants&#x27;.<p>The site does not label itself as : &quot;Completely un-biased news site weighing the thousands of studies dealing with all food types and providing equal 50-50 coverage of both plants and meat studies so people on the internet don&#x27;t cry about bias&quot;.\n\n            When &quot;plant-based&quot; is used as a euphemism for &quot;vegan,&quot; I find that annoying and borderline dishonest.<p>We all eat plants. Even lots of plants. But most of us are not vegan.<p>So if these people are vegan and pushing a vegan agenda ... I wish they&#x27;d make it more clear than &quot;plant based.&quot;<p>Incidentally, kimchi is easy to make, delicious, and healthy. AND most kimchi recipes are not vegan - they include one or two fishy ingredients.\n\n              Totally separate. I do think as opposing arguments get more extreme, it skews each side.  Then someone in the middle can look extreme.<p>There is just as strong an ideology and religious fervor around &#x27;carnivore&#x27;, and &#x27;keto&#x27; communities.<p>Then when someone suggests eating some plants, they yell &#x27;vegan&#x27;. And the more someone in the middle tries to argue &#x27;no, really, you need some fiber&#x27;, the more  they yell back &#x27;your vegan&#x27;.<p>If the person in the middle starts arguing back, and siting studies, the extreme side starts viewing them as extreme, even if they are in the middle.<p>Think the effect is called Overton Window.<p>I would hope no vegan would argue against Kimchi.  Kimchi is great.\n\nPrevious discussion about the same study:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39469988\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39469988</a>\n\nProving that it really is the pickle that makes the meal.\n\nAs opposed to fermented drinks, which were a pivotal moment in human brain shrinkage (at least the temporary variety).\n\nIn other words, <i>slightly</i> processed foods can be a good thing."

Even shared hosting wordpress with the cache turned on is fast.\n\n      You&#x27;d think so... There&#x27;s so many versions of WP caching and so many ways it&#x27;s deployed, that (with a fairly small experience) I&#x27;ve seen sites taking 5s+ to load after enabling the relevant option because suddenly minimisation and bundling kicked in on every request and kept the page fresh.

While it could be static I wanted it to be server. But I don&#x27;t think rust is the reason for it.

Thanks!\n\n  In the interest of making the page the <i>best version of itself</i>, the following phrase makes a mistake often made by native US English speakers:<p>&gt; But, you might wonder how does a Tree-sitter grammar look like,<p>How does $thing look?<p>or<p>What does $thing look like?<p>Similarly, one often hears &quot;Where are we at?&quot; It is common enough to be seen as a regionalism.<p>-- Your friendly tree-sitting grammarian\n\n    Interestingly enough, in German and Polish the analogous expression is in fact &quot;how does X look like?&quot; So maybe it&#x27;s an interference from those two languages? Or maybe it&#x27;s even a relict of the older English expression, displaced in England by &quot;what does X look like&quot; after the Am&#x2F;Br language split had happened.\n\n      Anecdotally, I hear the how&#x2F;what confusion from nearly every non-native English speaker I&#x27;ve ever met, regardless of native language.<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s one of those little things that&#x27;s surprisingly rare, like the th sound.\n\n    Huh, I&#x27;m not a native English speaker, but I changed it to &quot;what does a Tree-sitter grammar look like&quot;. It does sound better.\n\n    &gt; Similarly, one often hears &quot;Where are we at?&quot; It is common enough to be seen as a regionalism.<p>I’m a native English speaker who says “Where are we at”. I think it’s informal, but I never considered it to be wrong or awkward like the first example. Perhaps I’m in the region where it’s common.\n\n    &gt; <i>&quot;Where are we at?&quot;</i><p>Often elided to &quot;Where we at?&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s dialect, I wouldn&#x27;t use either in formal&#x2F;technical writing, but I would unselfconsciously say the latter, as in &quot;ok, moving down the agenda, where we at with item 3?&quot;.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily better... The two alternatives I think parse best are:<p>1. But you might wonder: what does a Tree-sitter grammar look like, and how do you create one for a language?<p>2. But you might wonder what a Tree-sitter looks like and how to create one for a language.<p>In either case, I agree the right word is &quot;what&quot; not &quot;how&quot;. The comma after &quot;but&quot; bugs me tremendously. The colon can be replaced by an em dash (—) if the writer prefers it—but I would not use a question mark for the second clause without separating it from the first &quot;but you might wonder&quot; in some way.<p>The comma left in alternative #1 is to needed (recommended?) because the &quot;and&quot; is joining two clauses with different subjects. I <i>think</i> it&#x27;s not strictly needed in alternative #2 because it&#x27;s really &quot;(but you might wonder (what a tree sitter looks like and how to create one for a language))&quot; where the inner term is a list of things the reader might wonder, and lists with only two items do not take a comma before &quot;and&quot;<p>I would also prefer &quot;Where are we?&quot; over &quot;Where are we at?&quot;<p>Not an English speaker, so just my $0.02.\n\n  As an exercise, I did one two years ago for pi-forall. That had a small scanner for the off-sides stuff. I lost steam after I got it working (and needed to add a bunch of rules). I think I was mainly trying to see if I could get tree-sitter to do off-sides (haskell-like indentation).<p>One issue that I remember was the web application to test the grammar needed an exact version of the emscripten stuff.

I mean writing the Grammer is of course something that is mandatory but it seems like programming languages are too much different in the architectural level of Tree-sitter\n\n  There is probably no such thing, because it would be hard to map programming language concepts onto each other perfectly. OK, you could have a union of those concepts in the IR, but the the benefit of IR would disappear, because you will have to deal with all the things on the next layer.\n\n    This is exactly right. You either end up with something very low-level (on the level of LLVM IR, for instance)—which means you aren&#x27;t constructing and analyzing high-level language constructs anymore—or with something high-level but with many language-specific special cases grafted on.<p>Where we&#x27;ve found success is in stepping back and creating formalisms that are language-agnostic to begin with, and then using tree-sitter to manage the language-specific translations into that formalism.  A good example is how we use stack graphs for precise code navigation [1], which uses a graph structure to encode a language&#x27;s name binding semantics, and which we build up for several languages from tree-sitter parse trees [2].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcreager.net&#x2F;talks&#x2F;stack-graphs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcreager.net&#x2F;talks&#x2F;stack-graphs&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;stack-graphs&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;languages\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;stack-graphs&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;languages</a>\n\n  Languages are generally only similar at a superficial level and have a lot of fractal detail with high variance.<p>For your data flow graph, are you going to handle copy constructors, assignment operator overloads, implicit conversions etc. like you see in C++? Or how about overload resolution: figuring out which method wins out over all candidates requires details about the convertibility of types, and how the language ranks candidates based on conversions required. And let&#x27;s not forget Koenig lookup.<p>Things like Tree-sitter can discover definitions, declarations and invocations, but matching the right declaration for an invocation isn&#x27;t trivial in the presence of overloads.\n\n  To be a bit pedantic, an AST is a kind of IR that represents syntactic constructs. Languages have different syntaxes so you can&#x27;t really have a language agnostic syntax tree.<p>Consider three languages, one with binary operators but no function application, and another with only function application, and a third with both. What would the &quot;agnostic&quot; AST be, except a union of the AST of the first two?\n\n    Why, Lisp of course!\n\n@lawn, There&#x27;s a typo towards the end (about 80%) down in the section on nvim-treesitter, should be `TSUpdate`, not `TSUdate`:<p><pre><code>  :TSUdate sdjot\n</code></pre>\nExcellent write up though!\n\n  Thank you, fixed.\n\nIs there any easy way to make tree-sitter produce smaller files? I was hoping to add support for nim to difftastic [1], but tree-sitter produces a 60MB .c file that’s too big to add to the repository.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Wilfred&#x2F;difftastic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;633\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Wilfred&#x2F;difftastic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;633</a>\n\n  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.<p>Tree-sitter is great until you inevitably run into a problem with it and find that it is impossible to fix properly if you can even figure out why the problem even exists.<p>The idea of a uniform api for querying syntax trees is a good one and tree-sitter deserves credit for popularizing it. It&#x27;s unfortunately not a great implementation of the idea.\n\n    Yes. It also presents itself as some sort of bastion of Rust stability, but segfaults <i>constantly</i>^. More than any NPM module I&#x27;ve ever used before. Any syntax that doesn&#x27;t precisely match the grammar is liable to take down your entire thread.<p>The wasm bindings are a necessity if you want to be anywhere near &quot;stable&quot;, but they run 3x slower.<p>^ the JS&#x2F;TS parser when invoked via the Node bindings, at least. Others are potentially better. The GH issues are rife with similar complaints.\n\n      Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here, but isn&#x27;t tree sitter already used by a bunch of stuff? Last I heard, github was moving all of their syntax highlighting to it, and a bunch of editors support it. Are they just dealing with the segfaults? Genuine question, because I&#x27;m considering using tree sitter for two different projects I&#x27;m working on (a LML and a full-blown language).<p>Or is it an issue with poorly-written grammars? The second you need to write an external parser with tree sitter, you have to start writing C, so I can see how that could lead to segfaults very quickly.<p>I dunno, I guess I&#x27;m just a bit surprised to hear a bunch of negative feedback towards tree-sitter, because up until now most of what I&#x27;ve heard has been pretty positive.\n\n        I have no idea what other folks are doing to stabilize it. For me, I needed a ton (hundreds of thousands) of JS&#x2F;TS(X) files parsed and ingested into other data pipelines and the segfaults were constant^. If you had a system where single files were only parsed on-demand via separate worker thread and the consequence of a segfault was the text appearing monotone, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be alright.<p>^One example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasp-lang&#x2F;wasp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;waspc&#x2F;data&#x2F;Generator&#x2F;templates&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;wasp&#x2F;auth&#x2F;forms&#x2F;internal&#x2F;common&#x2F;LoginSignupForm.tsx\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasp-lang&#x2F;wasp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;waspc&#x2F;data&#x2F;Gener...</a>\n\n        Even if tree-sitter had no bugs it can never really be trusted because there is always a divergence between the language&#x27;s official parser and the tree-sitter grammar -- unless the language actually uses tree-sitter as its parser, which no popular language does and it seems unlikely a future popular language will.<p>For syntax highlighting and code folding, what I said above is probably generally fine. Except for the fact that it will probably be wrong from time to time and then downstream users will waste hours of their lives trying to fix the broken highlighting instead of actually working on their real work.<p>On the implementation side, the whole thing has bizarre choices. It has created a culture in which checking in enormous generates files is common. It abdicates common and important features in popular languages like significant whitespace to error-prone external scanners. The GLR algorithm sometimes fails inexplicably and is essentially impossible to debug (not sure if the bugs are in the algorithm or the implementation). It bizarrely uses rust and node. The js dsl for grammars is needlessly verbose. The codegen is fairly slow in spite of using rust and the generated c files are insanely huge (probably a consequence of the GLR algorithm) which leads to horrific compile times which makes incremental development a nightmare. It also uses (unless it&#x27;s been updated in the last six months) a terrible algorithm for unicode lexing.<p>In my opinion, the whole premise of tree-sitter is kind of wrong. What would be better would be a uniform dsl for generating an AST (which can easily be represented with c structs or classes in any oo language). Trying to make a universal glr parser for all languages is a bad idea. It would generally be much easier, more accurate and faster to write the AST in the dsl that external tools recognize and then handwrite the parser that generates the AST. In the best case, the compiler already exposes an api to get the ast for some source code and you just need to write a translation program from compiler format to dsl format. Worst case, you rip out the parser in the compiler and have it generate the dsl ast format. Most handwritten parsers are only a few thousand lines of codes (maybe 10k at the high end).\n\n          Thanks! That&#x27;s super helpful!\n\n          &gt; It has created a culture in which checking in enormous generates files is common.<p>You&#x27;re not required to do that, and never have been. We&#x27;re going to move the grammars away from checking the generated `parser.c` in, but early in the project, it was a pretty pragmatic solution, given that many consumers of the grammars weren&#x27;t using a particular package registry like NPM or crates.io.<p>&gt; It abdicates common and important features in popular languages like significant whitespace to error-prone external scanners.<p>External scanners are the right tool for this. Nobody has proposed a better solution for this that actually works, and I don&#x27;t think there is one, because every programming language with significant implements it differently.<p>&gt; The GLR algorithm sometimes fails inexplicably and is essentially impossible to debug (not sure if the bugs are in the algorithm or the implementation)<p>It sounds like you personally have had trouble with debugging a grammar you&#x27;ve tried to develop, but it solves a problem.<p>&gt; It bizarrely uses rust and node.<p>Tree-sitter isn&#x27;t very coupled to node. We just shell out to a JS engine because we use JS (the most popular programming language, period) as a grammar DSL, rather than inventing our own language. Node is the most common one.<p>&gt; the generated c files are insanely (probably a consequence of the GLR algorithm)<p>No, it&#x27;s not because of GLR. A lot of the reason for the C code size is that we want to generate nice, readable, multi-line C expressions to represent data structures like parse tables, rather than encoding it in some cryptic, unreadable way. Also, incremental parsing requires that a bit more data be present in the parse table than would be required for a batch-only parser. What really matters is the code size of the final binaries. The generated `.so` or `.wasm` files for a Python parser are 503k, and 465k, respectively. The wasm gzips down to 69k. I would love to make it smaller, but there are pretty good reasons why it occupies the size that it does, and it&#x27;s currently pretty manageable.<p>&gt;  It also uses (unless it&#x27;s been updated in the last six months) a terrible algorithm for unicode lexing.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to here. UTF8 and UTF16 are decoded into code points using standard routines from `libicu`.\n\n            I don&#x27;t understand how you can say the code size has nothing to do with GLR and the explain that it is due to the formatting of the parse tables. The point is that table driven parsers are almost always huge compared to their recursive descent based alternatives (and, yes, recursive descent does have problems). The code size of the final binary is not all that matters because the huge c programs cause insanely slow compile times that make development incredibly painful. So that statement only holds if the time of grammar writers doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>I was too vague on unicode. I meant unicode character class matching. Last I checked, tree-sitter seemed to use a binary search on the code point to validate whether or not a character was in a unicode character class like \\p{Ll} rather than a table lookup. This lead to a noticeable constant slowdown of like 3x at runtime if I recall correctly for the grammar I was working on compared to an ascii set like [a-z].\n\n      Do you mean the parser generator itself (which is written in Rust) segfaults constantly, or the generated parsers (which are in C)?<p>It&#x27;s not surprising to me that there are issues with generated parsers, partly because many languages need external scanners to work, which have to be written in C and use a rather clunky API. tree-sitter-javascript also uses an external scanner so you might want to look there for whatever is causing the problem.\n\n        It may well have been the scanner that crashed, I was working at a startup and had about a million other things to deal with so I didn&#x27;t dig into it very long, I just switched to wasm and kept going. (Of course, the wasm bindings are subtly different and similarly lacking in type definitions, so that bit me down the road as well...).<p>But in general, I&#x27;d have to argue that if your &quot;very stable&quot; software requires interfacing with <i>very unstable</i> external tools to work with a very popular language... eliminating that dependency is certainly an area for improvement!\n\n          &gt;  I&#x27;d have to argue that if your &quot;very stable&quot; software requires interfacing with very unstable external tools to work with a very popular language... eliminating that dependency is certainly an area for improvement!<p>I think you may misunderstand parser generation and what tree sitter does. You can&#x27;t eliminate external scanners, and there isn&#x27;t another choice for them than C.<p>If you were just using an existing parser than you never touched any program written in Rust.\n\n            If the only job of the Rust is to create broken C, you&#x27;ll excuse me if I don&#x27;t find its stability particularly relevant to the tree-sitter proposition.<p>And the crash in this case does appear to be a result of a broken Rust-generated parser.c file, not some external tool, but I don&#x27;t know enough about the project to say for sure.\n\n      Did you open an issue for the segfault you got, on the Tree-sitter repo or the repo for the particular parser you were using?<p>It&#x27;s not really accurate to say that Tree-sitter segfaults constantly. The Tree-sitter CI performs randomized fuzz testing based on a bunch of popular grammars, randomly mutating entries from their test corpus. If you have a reproduction case for the segfault, it&#x27;d be useful to report.<p>Since you mention NPM, it sounds like you may be talking about a segfault that&#x27;s specific to the Tree-sitter Node.js bindings, but it&#x27;s hard to be sure.\n\n        No, I did not open an issue. When I checked the issues for tree-sitter-javascript, I saw the most recent issue was one reporting the same thing (segfault) from some weeks ago, with no attention. It still has had no attention, so I don&#x27;t think reporting would have done much.<p>Anyways, since you&#x27;re here, I dug a bit more into this to make a more useful report. Starting with v0.20.2, the following file will cause a segfault when parsed using tree-sitter-javascript: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tursodatabase&#x2F;libsql&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;libsql-sqlite3&#x2F;ext&#x2F;wasm&#x2F;api&#x2F;post-js-header.js\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tursodatabase&#x2F;libsql&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;libsql-sql...</a> . It worked fine in v0.20.1, and it&#x27;s still broken with the latest v0.20.4. Based on the diff here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tree-sitter&#x2F;tree-sitter-javascript&#x2F;compare&#x2F;v0.20.1...v0.20.2\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tree-sitter&#x2F;tree-sitter-javascript&#x2F;compar...</a>, I don&#x27;t on the surface see a way to dig deeper into this than trying to read through a 170,000 line (!!!) diff to parser.c.<p>And looking at that diff raises another complaint: the names of parser nodes must be considered part of the public API, as they are exposed in descendantsOfType, .type, etc., but they are 100% not documented anywhere, and are liable to change without notice in patch version bumps. This makes developing against it a massive pain, as any version increase is liable to break any code expecting a particular nomenclature.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to dunk on your project, I&#x27;m sure it solves some problems very well. But it is remarkably difficult to confidently depend on in a production environment.\n\n  Maybe tweaking the rules of the parser and check if it reduce the size of :\n#define STATE_COUNT 20290\n#define LARGE_STATE_COUNT 10594<p>in parser.c\n\n    That&#x27;s a good idea, thanks!\n\nI&#x27;m not abreast of all the latest buzz in NeoVim, but I&#x27;ve been hearing and seeing good things about Treesitter in general.<p>Is the plan to at some point deprecate the existing vim-style syntax highlighting (syn match&#x2F;region etc.) in favor of treesitter-based syntax highlighting? Where can I find this discussion if it is happening?"

Why tack that back on?\n\n  To me whole db being a single file is something.\n\n  That&#x27;s a great question. This pattern is actually getting popular today with services like Turso and Cloudflare D1 (technically only SQLite <i>compliant</i>).<p>There are a few reasons I can see reaching for SQLite behind an API rather than something like Postgres. Portability can be a big benefit and I would expect you don&#x27;t need to deal with connection pooling.<p>If I had a service running on a single box and didn&#x27;t mind setting up my own db backups, I might reach for SQLite just for the ease of standing up new environments for dev and automated testing.\n\n    I&#x27;ve found postgres via docker to be fine for dev and testing, but there are various epheremal postgres scripts, plus this could be promising for node stuff <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;electric-sql&#x2F;pglite\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;electric-sql&#x2F;pglite</a> if it works out. I&#x27;d imagine if this does work out we&#x27;ll see the same kind of builds for other runtimes as well (like python)\n\n  Accessing the database from multiple applications or systems.<p>SQLite is great for sharing application data as well.  If you have, for example data for a specific event,. It can make sense to use a separate database&#x2F;file.<p>Being able to simply copy as a backup&#x2F;archive is big here.<p>You might still want your application or services separate.  Similarly take a look at Turso or AstroDB for more options.  Turso created libSQL as a fork with libSQL server.\n\n  Frankly, you thought wrong. The whole point of sqlite was to build a database for naval vessels. Aside from that, given it&#x27;s open source, the &quot;point&quot; of it doesn&#x27;t really matter anymore.\n\n    Huh, this is a little piece of history I was not aware of. Neat and somewhat helps explain the design philosophy of SQLite knowing that\n\n      Semi-related, there’s an anecdote that the InterBase database was selected for use within the M1 Abraham’s tank because it was particularly robust in its implementation.<p>Apparently an issue with the M1 is that because of the energy produced when the main gun is fired, internal systems may spontaneously reset. So they had to design around that phenomenon through things like robustness and rapid system restart times.\n\n      If you want to know more of the origins of SQLite I can highly recommend this episode of the Corecursive podcast<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corecursive.com&#x2F;066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corecursive.com&#x2F;066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp&#x2F;</a>\n\n    That is inaccurate.  Ginko&#x27;s statement is closer to truth.<p>I was inspired to write SQLite while working with Informix on DDG-79 and I saw how useful an embedded database would be in some situations, compared to a client&#x2F;server solution.  So I went off and wrote SQLite on my own, while the development contract was on hiatus.  There was never a request for SQLite or anything like it coming from the the navy (or more precisely, Bath Iron Works) as they were both very happy with Informix on the ship and Oracle on land and had zero desire for anything new or different.  The development team I worked on ended up using SQLite some for prototyping and testing on that project, but it was never deployed to the ship, as far as I know.<p>So yes, the whole point of SQLite was to build a database that operated as a library linked into the application, rather than as a separate server, as ginko postulates.  Design issues on a single system within DDG-79 (Automated Common Diagrams) were the inspiration for that idea, but to say that SQLite was designed for DDG-79 is not true.  There was never a request for SQLite coming from the navy or the ship designers.  Indeed, there is was a lot of pushback against SQLite.  SQLite was just a crazy idea coming from a rogue developer who happened to be working on one of the many on-board systems at that time.\n\n      Thank you for your work on SQLite and Fossil !! They are amazing.<p>Any chance of WAL2 being included as a standard journal_mode option in the near future? ..or BEGIN CONCURRENT ? :)\n\n      I&#x27;ve always wondered why sqlite came along, but adoption of msql (Matt Dillons&#x27; similar database stack) didn&#x27;t catch on .. did you have any opportunity to review the existing database tools that were available at the time, and if so - what did you find?<p>I realize this question is a bit archaic so if there&#x27;s not really any good answers, no worries - but as I was using Matt&#x27;s msql in the 2000&#x27;s in the same way that I now use sqlite, its something I often wonder whenever I set up a new sqlite.db ...\n\n      This was great, but you should have started the comment with &quot;I&#x27;m D. Richard Hipp. You know nothing of my work.&quot;\n\n  &gt;I thought the whole point of SqLite is that you don&#x27;t have to deal with the cruft and overhead of having to send queries over a network connection. Why tack that back on?<p>An interesting application could be a web-application whose ONLY server is the SqLite -server. The state of the application would be stored into the SqLite database, not into &quot;local storage&quot; etc.  Using a relational database is a great improvement in flexibility over using the key-value store of Local Storage.<p>Could this work? I guess we would need to load one web-page into the browser first to load some HTML and scripts and then that page could use fetch() to get everything else from the SqLite -server.\n\n    What’s the security model for this? Seems like you’d end up with users able to run arbitrary queries against the database.\n\n      Good Question. The SqLite REST-server should probably provide ways of allowing only selected operations. There&#x27;s no reason why EVERYTHING should be possible over the network.<p>One possibility could be that each user would have their own copy of the database, let them break it if they want to :-)\n\n    There&#x27;s also the wasm build of sqlite that you could just run directly if it&#x27;s really necessary. Of course there might be performance differences\n\n  I regularly use an embedded sqlite database in my projects, and the existence of tools such as soul and pocketbase means I can easily make those databases available to other members of my team without having to write a custom front-end or component of my application to deal with their unwillingness to install an sqlite GUI on systems they may not necessarily be able to do so, in the first place.\n\nSome suggestions:<p>The submitted page can add a link to the github repo.

Since they make a special container for you they basically adopt your build system, which may be hard for them. Does this go beyond mutation testing?\n\n  With most of our customers, they don&#x27;t actually have to change their build system at all. We take their normal CI products, plus a small amount of special configuration, and run them. This is actually a good thing because we&#x27;re testing something very similar to what runs in production.<p>The kinds of state space exploration we do are a lot more general than mutation testing. Our current product does exploration by (1) varying the space of faults, packet delivery times, thread schedules, etc., and (2) driving a customer-provided pseudo-randomized workload.

Where does the &quot;want&quot; come from to compare your &quot;got&quot;s to?

(1) A lot of stuff we can detect automatically, like crashes, OOMs, etc. (2) You should turn on assertions in all the code you send to us. (3) We can write generalized temporal regexes against your log messages or other output. (4) We offer SDKs that allow you to declare test properties inline in your code.

For example, let&#x27;s say one of my tests is flaky because it asks an external service to give it some data, and that external service is flaky in what it returns?<p>Or what if my bug is caused by bitflips in failing memory, that lead to impossible control flow paths being hit?

Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get to it eventually. We have all kinds of crazy ideas for new faults.<p>Communication with the outside world is something that we obviously have to ban. This means that all of the inputs to your system are being provided by our platform, and that any dependencies have to be mocked, or run inside the hypervisor with you.<p>In practice this can cause friction for people with a ton of dependencies. Some of the most common things we&#x27;ve already mocked (for example we have an entire fake AWS that we can run in there with you), and if your dependency is one of our existing customers, we can probably work something out...\n\n    How do y&#x27;all provide the fake AWS? Is it built in-house or are you running something like LocalStack?\n\n      i think they mention in a previous blog post with warpstream that they use localstack\n\n  The product does not appear to be a record-replay debugging product, it appears to be a precise fault injection test generation product.<p>In a record-replay debugging product, you want to reproduce the execution of your system to translate what occurred in reality into the debugging lab.<p>In this product, the goal appears to be creating a deterministic environment so that you can precisely inject non-determinism&#x2F;faults to probe the response of your product to the environment.<p>The former is about analyzing bugs your test found, the latter is about creating tests to produce bugs. In that context, your question is unrelated to the product. It does not seek to reproduce flaky tests, it seeks to help invent new and exciting flaky tests.\n\n    You&#x27;re sort of right, but we&#x27;re actually sort of both. We use determinism to do controlled fault-injection and to explore your program&#x27;s state space, but we can <i>also</i> use it for very powerful debugging. Look for future announcements about this.\n\n      Certainly. Once you have a deterministic environment, the ability to replay execution is basically free.<p>In fact, what has been described is basically the replay engine in a record-replay system which “runs” the recorded execution of a non-deterministic system in a deterministic mode to replay the exact same execution. As such, it retains the same benefits available to any replay. The key here is that you can “bypass” the record step since you are already running in the replay engine from the start.\n\nI&#x27;m not familiar with the area, so am likely missing something, but how do they do deterministic thread-level context switching? Something like:<p><pre><code>  var_1 = 0  \n  var_2 = 0\n  \n  thread_a:\n    while true:\n      something_complex()\n      var_1 ++\n  \n  thread_b:\n    while true:\n      something_complex()\n      var_2 ++\n</code></pre>\nUnder the quoted definition of determinism, for every point in time, var_1 and var_2 should have the same values across all executions. But this would seem to amount to ensuring that exactly the same number of instructions are executed each time a thread is scheduled.\n\n  You are exactly correct. Our hypervisor grants you this power (and then we use the power to explore as many possible values of var_1 and var_2 as we can, in case some of them trigger a concurrency bug, e.g.)\n\n    Nifty! Thanks for the response.\n\n    The resolution of your deterministic scheduler is probably not based on quanta like &quot;instructions&quot;, right?  More likely it takes traditional input like a stable clock tick?\n\n  <i>ensuring that exactly the same number of instructions are executed each time a thread is scheduled</i><p>AFAIK this is possible by (mis)using performance counters.\n\n    Alex discusses this in the post. Performance counters were the first thing we tried, but alas they&#x27;re non-deterministic about every one-in-a-trillion instructions.\n\nInteresting project. I almost wish I had a concurrency bug to test it on.<p>&gt; Guest software running in the Antithesis platform still experiences concurrency similar to a multi-core &#x2F; multi-machine system, thanks to the process scheduling imposed by the guest OS<p>This might not exercise the full set of race conditions. When two threads are running simultaneously on separate cores (or hyper-threaded on the same core) they can interleave instructions at a much finer granularity than any OS time slicing would cause, even within instructions.<p>For example, could it find a race condition where two threads are executing INC [addr] on the same memory address, where context switching between instructions doesn&#x27;t trigger it?\n\n  If history is any guide, everybody has concurrency bugs.\n\n  &gt; For example, could it find a race condition where two threads are executing INC [addr] on the same memory address, where context switching between instructions doesn&#x27;t trigger it?<p>I&#x27;m not actually familiar with the details of hardware MMUs, but would they not enforce sequential access of the address? Or do MMUs allow parallel reads and writes?\n\n    x86 processors have a LOCK instruction prefix, which makes some instructions atomic including increment. Increment is nontrivial to make atomic, because there are two memory accesses: read X and write back X+1.  It&#x27;s a bit slow, because it has to inform every other core in the system, &quot;Hey, I just read this memory address and I&#x27;m about to write something back to it, so don&#x27;t don&#x27;t use it until I&#x27;m done.&quot; C++ has functions to do this like std::atomic_fetch_add, but they&#x27;re clunky to use so people often forget.\n\n      Ahh, it&#x27;s 2 separate memory accesses just encapsulated in one instruction, that explains it. Yeah, unless this hypervisor allows context switching at the level of microcode ops, that seems to be undetectable currently.\n\n      The way that&#x27;s currently implemented is actually just one memory operation these days.  L2 (or really wherever coherency is mostly managed) has a tiny ALU so in addition to read or write, atomicop is an operation you can send to L2.  It&#x27;ll gain Modified or Exclusive access to the cache line(s) that op is addressed to and just do the operation right there.  That way the normal cache protocol is all you need for atomicity, and really the line is only contended for a single cycle from the L2 controller&#x27;s (and the rest of the coherency peers) perspective.<p>That&#x27;s why they retconned the lock prefix to not be an actual assertion of the #LOCK signal any more.<p>That&#x27;s also why TileLink and AMBA include atomic ops like addition and bitwise ops in their coherency protocols rather than just &#x27;claim region&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s also why you see newer archs like RISC-V and Arm64 that have both lr&#x2F;sc style ops, in addition to direct atomic memory ops like amoadd.w, it better matches the primitives of the underlying memory system.\n\n        That&#x27;s not how it works on x86 as far as I know. The atomic ops are simply performed by the ALU, against the L1 cache when the instruction is about to retire. Atomicity is guaranteed by not allowing the line to be stolen by another core between the operation, and memory order is ensured by draining the store buffer before executing the op and other speculation (eg loads can speculatively pass even atomic operations).\n\n  You are correct. There&#x27;s a set of concurrency bugs that require actual SMP setups to trigger (like stuff with atomic operations, memory ordering, etc.). If you&#x27;re trying to build a very low-level lock-free data structure where this is your primary threat model, Antithesis is not the right tool for you... for now... until we build a CPU simulator...\n\nThis is a very promising project that I&#x27;ve seen a lot of attempts to do in the past, but never got to the level of progress that you have! Very impressive work!<p>I am sad that you decided to give up on solving the multi-core parallelism issue, since each guest running on a single core is a dead giveaway to malware that they&#x27;re not on a real machine, but it&#x27;s understandable. I do wonder if that means that some class of bugs will be undetectable to this hypervisor, though.\n\n  What do you mean by a dead giveaway to malware? We&#x27;re allowed to lie to the guest OS about how many CPUs there are!\n\n    Not a dead giveaway i suppose, you&#x27;re right. And in fact, since you can control precisely the number of instructions per thread timeslice, it does seem non-trivial to decide if you&#x27;re running under more then one core due to the hypervisor being able to inject non-determinism into the context switching.\n\nI&#x27;ve long thought about these kind of OS designs, and what great features they can enable (such as time travel debugging). But the non-determinism introduced by inter-CPU interactions is a fundamental limitation, hence the need to run everything on a single isolated core.<p>One day(^TM) I&#x27;m really keen to design a multi-core CPU architecture that allows for deterministic message passing between cores in such a way that you could get this kind of software working with true parallelism.\n\nFun read. It has some similar ideas to  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dedis.cs.yale.edu&#x2F;2010&#x2F;det&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dedis.cs.yale.edu&#x2F;2010&#x2F;det&#x2F;</a> but that was actually focused on multicore processing and the communication across cores.<p>Congrats on the launch.\n\nDid you decide on a hypervisor instead of an emulator for overhead reasons?  I don&#x27;t work there but I heard Microsoft has something called tkofuzz which similarly emphasizes determinism but uses Bochs internally.\n\nI love this. Many a moon ago, I worked on a system called Aikido at MIT, which combined a special built hypervisor with a binary rewriting system (DynamoRio) to enable efficient time travel debugging and race detection of parallel applications.<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested, here&#x27;s a publication that talks about it in more detail:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;72082\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;72082</a><p>The use of performance counters here also reminds me of another project I worked on called Kendo, which was a posix thread like replacement that used performance counters to enforce a deterministic interleaving of synchronization operations (mutexes, etc). The system could guarantee determinism for programs that didn&#x27;t have race conditions. Back then, I found that counting instructions wasn&#x27;t deterministic on the processors of the time, but counting store operations was. If anyone&#x27;s interested in that work, here&#x27;s the publication:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cag.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;~mareko&#x2F;asplos073-olszewski.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cag.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;~mareko&#x2F;asplos073-olszewski.pdf</a>\n\nI don&#x27;t understand how this works in the case of testing many applications running on many machines, where many services on many machines need to communicate with each other. We deploy a mix of systemd services and OCI containers (running on podman and Docker) to different machines, the exact mix on each machine depends on the machine&#x27;s intended purpose.<p>We currently run CI tests using QEMU VMs. These VMs comprise a few systems representative of those that we deploy to production.<p>Does adopting Antithesis mean that all non-containerized applications would need to be OCI-ified and every interaction would need to be mocked? There&#x27;s a sort of combinatorial explosion that I&#x27;m concerned about when I&#x27;m thinking about testing&#x2F;adding a new service to a system: All services on which it depends need to be mocked and all services which depend on it require creating a mocked version of it.<p>Seems like a lot of work. Can someone please help clarify things for me?<p>Also, how could we test the behavior of non-application code like drivers or the kernel itself?\n\n  I believe they have a discord for asking questions directly to their engineers <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;75cBWkbC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;75cBWkbC</a>\n\n    Thanks!\n\n  The relevant part is<p>&gt; The Antithesis environment simulates one or more computers using a collection of containers, all running within a single virtual machine managed by our hypervisor.<p>No mocking needed, but everything needs to share the single VM.<p>And it sure sounds like they run a custom kernel in the guest, so this is not for kernelspace testing:<p>&gt; Since the Antithesis platform controls the guest’s scheduler,"

Funding would be better sourced from cuts to things like military spending, which is well known for being egregiously wasteful and inefficient with its problems with pork barrel projects, fractal spiral subcontracting, and how practically anything it asks for gets rubberstamped with little question.\n\n      fundings for it is low now, how about when we have thousands on the Moon&#x2F;Mars? will Earth poverty be eradicated etc.?<p>the point the op raised is relevant from a historical perspective, as probably the firsts who will populate the moon and Mars will think they are living the future; meawhile people die of dehydration this night<p>also we barely can&#x27;t grow lettuce at space and that&#x27;s missions at millions of USD... i think a society which is well stablished and care for everyone&#x27;s welfare is more likely to collaborate and build technology to get away from the solar system than our shit greed of today, despite the great amount of good and intelligent people who sometimes can&#x27;t even do stuff because academia conflict etc.\n\n        Settlements on the Moon, Mars, or anywhere else beyond Earth’s orbit are going to be brutal for decades to come, no matter how much money gets poured into them. The first settlers are going to be spending every waking moment securing their existence and making it more sustainable. These places won’t be joyride destinations.<p>Perhaps it’s pessimistic, but I have little faith that even a single country will eradicate suffering within its own borders, let alone all countries coming together to cooperate and eliminate it globally. If we wait until all earthly problems are solved before going into space, we’ll simply never go to space. At some point something will happen that will stop launches entirely, we’ll lose our institutional knowledge of rocketry and spaceflight, and putting things in orbit (let alone people on the moon) will become an impossibility again.\n\n          won&#x27;t be a joyride but won&#x27;t be living close or in starvation and in an overly cold&#x2F;hot house...<p>settlement on Mars&#x2F;Moon is a multi-disciplinary act! figuring out efficient and safe geothermal or nuclear or whatever technology to improve Earth&#x27;s life, definitely translates to future settlements... so why not do it here? it isn&#x27;t about eradicating suffering, as it&#x27;s part of the existence (probably) but it&#x27;s about providing a decent life for everyone\n\n            The capacity to make Mars work, necessarily means we develop the capacity to drop an autonomous pod anywhere (on Earth or Mars) that can make fuel from the air and use local dirt to either fashion a complete shelter or at least place a protective layer over a lightweight one from 50 million miles away.<p>(I assume, but have no hard numbers, that it&#x27;s also cheaper to send hydroponic systems to Mars than to ship food regularly: conditional on that, also to ship an autonomous food factory).<p>Going to Mars long term also requires the shipping cost to space is reduced so much that the cost to LEO is competitive with current airline rates, so when I say &quot;drop an autonomous pod anywhere&quot; I really do mean <i>anywhere</i> — Sudan, Malawi, Nepal, Everest, Antarctica, are all much easier than Olympus Mons.\n\n      These go hand in hand.<p>Human spaceflight in the US today is 100% driven by the desire to militarize space.<p>See Gateway: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lunar_Gateway\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lunar_Gateway</a><p>This is all about supporting military habitation of the moon.<p>This reply seems to assume the argument is against space exploration in total, when it&#x27;s actually against human space travel.<p>The idea that inter-stellar human space flight should be funded is pretty far out there...\n\n    &gt; But those aren&#x27;t caused by resources diverted to space exploration.<p>Going to space IS politics. It is, essentially, a vanity goal for a whole society. The resources diverted are, essentially, mindshare and political.<p>It is only fair then that people ask why we as a society look to space when we have so many problems here, just as it was fair to ask why so much attention was given to the race to the moon rather than, say, civil rights [1].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=goh2x_G0ct4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=goh2x_G0ct4</a>\n\n  The last century has involved the fastest reduction in severe poverty ever seen in human history, and it&#x27;s not stopping anytime soon. We&#x27;re allowed to also do other things.\n\n  Wow.<p>1. There are people who live the way they do by choice. Folks who got that education and opportunity and rejected it. Your perspective of &quot;mud huts bad&quot; is very centric to how you were raised. It&#x27;s one step removed from handing the natives a bible and having them build a church to civilize them.<p>2. No matter how we organize the word, there&#x27;s always gonna be a line, and someone will be at the back. Sending that line in a new direction might be the next evolution of the species. Your iPhone is magic to someone 200 years ago, should we wait till everyone has a iPhone till we make any more advancement.<p>3. Warfare? Eco destruction? Unless your very old, its likely primate warfare at scale was well before your lifetime. As for the eco side of things, well you should take some comfort in the rate of change for the positive that your seeing.\n\n    You can&#x27;t really be arguing that people live in mud huts by choice?<p>Or that they squandered their copious opportunities?<p>&quot;More than 80 percent of Indians (about 700 million) live on less than $1.25 a day&quot;<p>Saying that we shouldn&#x27;t spend money to send humans into inter-stellar space is not the same as saying we should stop all technical advancement.<p>But really, we&#x27;d be better off without iPhone or Android as well.

You should look at what much of Africa has done.<p>There are plenty of people living in their areas version of mud huts, with cell phones and solar panels. &quot;Mud huts&quot; are in some places very much the local, renewable building material. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisisafrica.me&#x2F;lifestyle&#x2F;wisdom-african-hut&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisisafrica.me&#x2F;lifestyle&#x2F;wisdom-african-hut&#x2F;</a>\n\n        I think you&#x27;ve misunderstood! You seem to have taken the &quot;mud huts&quot; comment literally. The person you replied to was using it as a euphemism for extreme poverty, not a literal description of a particular construction material. Hope this lifts any further confusion.\n\n        Compressed earth bricks are fantastic building material and easy to build the machines for it.<p>And it&#x27;s all open source!<p>I&#x27;m with you on this, OP is being egocentric and playing a zero sum game which it clearly isn&#x27;t.\n\n      You appear unaware of the breadth and depth of earth structures in history:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earth_structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earth_structure</a><p>&quot;Mud huts&quot; have lasted for many generations, had multiple levels, have excellent cooling properties for hot climates, etc.<p>Advancing technology shouldn&#x27;t occlude proven technology.\n\n      The problem with this argument is that is that it logically dictates that we can only spend money on one thing at a time.<p>You bring up space travel, but the exact same argument applies to sports, movies, art, technology, evenbthe Internet itself. Once distilled as &quot;how can we spend money on x when y&quot; then it behoves us to identify y, and spend on literally nothing else.<p>Globally not-spending on defence for example would free up resources enough to substantially raise the standard of living for billions.<p>On the other hand, spending is raising the standard of living for billions already. Movies spend huge amounts, employing the services of hundreds of professions. The money poured into movies doesn&#x27;t get destroyed, it gets distributed.  (Including globally to places like India, Cape Town, and so on.) So it is with spending on space. The bulk of the money is spent&#x2F;recycled here on earth.<p>The problems you highlight (poverty, living conditions, health facilities etc) are complex though and seldom fixed simply with money. In some ways money is the easy part, other factors (like human greed leading to corruption) are trickier.<p>So, I hear what you are saying, but its not an either-or proposition. There&#x27;s room for both. I applaud your desire to focus on the problems of others. Don&#x27;t worry about other areas, focus on the people you can help.\n\n        Yeah. Money does get recycled, and some, invested in something that increases productivity, say a tractor for the farm, instead of an armoured vehicle for defence, increases wealth quicker. Unfortunately without that armoured vehicle we may all be gobbled up by a neighbour with bad intentions. A balance between many things seems what keeps us going forward. The hard part seems to agree on the balance.<p>Personally I found that there is enough opportunity in areas which improve things, work against poverty, environmental destruction etc, that this is what I focus on.\n\n      &gt; &quot;More than 80 percent of Indians (about 700 million) live on less than $1.25 a day&quot;<p>This quote is outdated.<p>It&#x27;s 11.9% (167 million) on less than $2.15&#x2F;day: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;poverty?insight=the-rapid-progress-seen-in-many-countries-shows-an-end-to-poverty-is-possible#explore-data-on-poverty\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;poverty?insight=the-rapid-progres...</a><p>Your quote requires India to have a population of about 875 million, it&#x27;s currently about 1.4 billion.<p>&gt; A more democratized technological advancement would benefit many more people, to a much greater degree<p>What does &quot;democratized&quot; even mean here? This stuff is widely available, do you want governments getting involved?<p>&gt; But they&#x27;d almost certainly be a more accessible s&#x2F;w development platform<p>What does &quot;more accessible&quot; mean? The knowledge to learn is given away for free. Making the tools multilingual or blind-accessible is hard but the big players do it anyway. Open source tools have man pages, which always had terrible reputations. Both open and closed source tools have wikis and forums and blogs.\n\n    &gt; No matter how we organize the word, there&#x27;s always gonna be a line<p>About one million people die of dysentry each year. I doubt that people got the opportunity to not die of dysentry and rejected it. You can have an ivory-tower argument about this hypothetic line, but in this world of ours, it&#x27;s going to be hard to claim we&#x27;re past that line.\n\n  This is analogous to arguing against exploring the Americas because Europe had poverty.<p>It seems to me that over a couple hundred year time horizon the new land, resources, technologies and economies of scale added by the new world were clearly a net benefit to europeans as a whole and paid back the initial investment many times over.\n\n    If Europe had ended poverty before enslaving the rest of the world, it would be a much better world now.<p>How could anyone argue against that?<p>A people that were interested in raising others around them out of poverty, before setting off to devastate and enslave other continents, would probably have treated the people they found on those continents much more humanly.<p>If the european colonial diaspora had set out to advance other places, as opposed to exploiting them, we probably wouldn&#x27;t have global poverty today.<p>The &quot;return on investment&quot; of colonizing north america was made by exporting tobacco to europe, clear cutting the north american continent, near extincting major mega-fauna and replacing them with invasive species, and shipping africans to the americas for slave labor.<p>Considering that a net positive is a dubious conclusion. But of course we have to ask: net positive for whom?<p>And of course, misses the point of the original comment: that there are no resources to be exploited 40 light years from earth! It&#x27;s a one way trip...\n\n      &gt;  before enslaving the rest of the world<p>try a broad History of Slavery before asserting that the Age of Exploration was just one big slave-fest, please. Its a bigoted statement to meld them together without the actions of other civilizations taken into account.\n\n      This is such a silly take. <i>Europe</i> enslaved <i>the world</i>? Sorry, but slavery was an institution long before <i>some</i> Europeans took part in it (emphasis on &quot;took part&quot; as it was cooperative, involving African, Arab, etc. slave traders), and continues to be practiced long after those European empires abolished it within their own empires. The abolitionist movement was also European, and certainly Western. And how can you know if the world would have been better? That&#x27;s a counterfactual you either cannot know, or one that fails to account for all the good that was also transmitted through colonialism, or absorbed by the colonial powers. It wasn&#x27;t black and white. And even where the bad is concerned, while there is not argument <i>for</i> chattel slavery, good can come out of bad things. Furthermore, you are reducing European influence to one aspect of one aspect, not even just colonialism, which is not even uniquely European, but slavery per se. This is ridiculous.<p>Your argument w.r.t. poverty is also the same boring reductive fallacy that people who argue against beautiful architecture and art make (&quot;You could have fed so many people with that money!&quot;). Guess what: you can do both. You don&#x27;t &quot;solve poverty&quot; by spending a sum of money on food over art. Those people will be hungry soon. That&#x27;s one. Two, Man does not live by bread alone. Beauty matters. We don&#x27;t live to eat. We eat to live. And yes, we can both care for the starving <i>and</i> invest in things other than helping the poor.<p>The idea that Europe is responsible for global poverty is also obtuse, historically illiterate, and devoid of common sense. There was plenty of poverty in the world before the evil European showed up. If anything, Western commerce, whatever its flaws, has lifted many out of poverty. Yes, capitalism, whatever its flaws, has lifted many, especially the West, out of poverty and into a good deal of <i>material</i> comfort. Look at the 20th century alone. It&#x27;s better to be poor today than poor a century or a few centuries ago. The average man today is far better off today materially than he has ever been, than even the materially better off in previous centuries were.<p>Our ancestors weren&#x27;t perfect, and we should not repeat their errors, but it takes a certain kind of ingratitude and blindness to fail to appreciate the cumulative good they did leave us, an ingratitude and blindness seemingly particular to snarky, ideologically infected oikophobes in the West. Believe me: Africans aren&#x27;t generally seething with hatred at the good of the West the way people in the West do. If anything, they are more likely to despise the malaise and decadence they see in the West today, that the West is trying to force down the throats of everyone else. They are looking to replicate what is actually good in the West in their own countries.\n\n      Incredibly anti-historical take.\n\n  ah yes, good old &quot;whitey on the moon&quot; rhetoric.<p>god forbids we do anything to advance the humanity until we achieve total outcome equality first.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think anyone is arguing we need it to be perfect, which is impossible, but certainly the extreme situation we find ourselves in right now is ridiculous and much could be done. I love space, I want us to spend on space, but the price tag does matter. If we can take the money out of the military, that would be a great step.\n\n  &gt; There&#x27;s actually a third intractable reality up against star travel:<p>How is this intractable? This is a moral argument. It won&#x27;t stop anyone from doing it. I am not sure you are using the word intractable correctly. It implies impossible, or unrealistic to be solved even if hypothetically possible, etc.<p>Whereas from what you say it seems it&#x27;s possible, you just think it should not be done (due to being in your view immoral).<p>Very different things.\n\n  &gt; is just so outrageously wasteful, not to mention self-centered and selfish, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s literally a crime against humanity.<p>You&#x27;re &quot;not wrong&quot;, but you&#x27;re taking a rather negatively biased view on the matter...it is also hilarious, <i>simultaneously</i>.\n\n  You’re assuming the resources can be distributed better, if only they weren’t “wasted” on space travel. I suspect the problems you’re describing exist _because_  we can’t distribute better - we don’t know how. We’ve reached the limits of social organization at this stage of civilization and those problems won’t ever be solved unless we innovate our way out of it.<p>You might counter my argument with a plethora of “obvious” solutions, but I suspect most of them will be top-down ones, that, unfortunately, that don’t seem to ever work. You might also enumerate instances where top-down initiatives have worked successfully, but I’d argue that in each of the cases there was something about the environment that made it stick - the soil was already fertile.<p>The amount of money spent on “lofty” pursuits like space exploration is almost orthogonal to the issue at hand, within reason, obviously - it’s definitely possible to bankrupt yourself like the Soviet Union did.<p>I put “lofty” in quotes because these pursuits are obviously very practical in the long run. I don’t want to repeat the argument you’ve probably heard a million times, but it’s obviously true that if everyone thought like this back when we living in caves - we’d never even get huts. And we were much poorer back then.\n\n  1) There will always be some people who will live in mud huts. Do I need to explain why?<p>2) Probably the biggest improvements in quality of life on Earth came because of America (North, mostly). Those countries exists today because extremely big resources were invested by the kings in Europe to cross the ocean at a time when standards of living there were unimaginably bad. They could have given the money to the poor instead.\n\nGood read!<p>In the greater scheme of things, spaceflight isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> different from early ocean explorers, right?<p>Build a vessel that suits the environment it&#x27;ll travel in, stock it with equipment &amp; supplies, head off into the unknown. Hope that supplies last long enough to set foot on the other side, and&#x2F;or &#x27;live off the land&#x27;.<p>Viewed like that, asteroids are kinda like islands, where some fresh fruit, timber etc may be found. Adventurers may like it &amp; hang there while the ship sails on.\n\n  Except early ocean explorers didn’t have to worry about being obliterated by a tiny speck of dust going too fast.<p>e.g. If a random speck of dust hitting their raft could have done the same, there likely would have been a very different paradigm…\n\n    Or constant winds that can penetrate meters of some materials and cause cellular damage and death. And no native food, water, or atmosphere.\n\n      Ah, space-scurvy.\n\n        space-scurvy is the same as regular scurvy. I can easily imagine it happening if your hydroponics go bad.\n\n    Dead is dead- invisible underwater rocks in uncharted waters, hurricanes, new foreign diseases, etc. will kill you just as well as space dust!\n\n    They had enough of their own worries.  “There is but a plank between a sailor and eternity.”\n\n    Rogue waves were common and were very deadly\n\n      *Are.<p>Rogue waves continue to be very deadly even to very large ships, and extremely unpredictable despite much better weather monitoring and communications.\n\n    Space is mostly vacuum, the sea is mostly water and wind, with some dangerous shoals&#x2F;rocks thrown in for good measure.<p>Sailing from Britain to Australia on a wooden ship took approximately the same time as flying from the Earth to Mars. I bet that the sailors met a lot more dangerous weather conditions on the way to Australia than the spacecraft on their way to Mars.<p>&quot;Hull losses&quot; due to cosmic dust are basically zero, the only recorded instances are on low Earth orbit due to space debris.<p>&quot;Hull losses&quot; due to storms or navigational mistakes were absolutely normal during the Age of Exploration, and long after.\n\n      It&#x27;s weird that you seem to believe these analogies you&#x27;re making with zero examples of the latter. Of course when you&#x27;re imagining the whole thing and willing to fudge the details in favor of the conclusion you want, it&#x27;s really easy to make the argument that it&#x27;s feasible and worthwhile\n\n        This is a very personal attack-like reply (weird, imagining, fudging etc.), and I believe it has no place on Hacker News.<p>Anyway, no vessel that ever left the low Earth orbit was ever lost to cosmic dust. How am I expected to provide examples of something that never happened?<p>As for losses of old wooden ships en route to Australia, there were plenty. Being a sailor was <i>the</i> most dangerous profession in the Age of Sail, and the very reason why sailors got tattos was a chance to be recognized as a drowned corpse.\n\n          I&#x27;m not personally attacking you, I&#x27;m saying your argument makes no sense, because you&#x27;re trying to draw equivalences between recorded accounts of history and things that have never happened<p>Like how long it takes to fly humans to mars. It hasn&#x27;t happened yet, we can only estimate and try to project it, so the case that it might take as long as it took to sail across some particular ocean for some particular group of people with the technology they had at the time is not only kind of irrelevant, but also not a claim that can be supported. This is what&#x27;s typically referred to as &quot;fudging the numbers&quot;<p>The things you said and the point you are trying to be make by saying them is pretty ridiculous. You may choose to take that personally, but perfectly reasonable people say a lot of crazy shit. It may well be that the fact that internet fora make this a matter of somewhat durable record makes people view their arguments in this context as more tightly coupled with them as a person, but that&#x27;s still ultimately for you to decide for yourself\n\n            &gt; Like how long it takes to fly humans to mars. It hasn&#x27;t happened yet, we can only estimate and try to project it, so the case that it might take as long as it took to sail across some particular ocean for some particular group of people with the technology they had at the time is not only kind of irrelevant, but also not a claim that can be supported. This is what&#x27;s typically referred to as &quot;fudging the numbers&quot;<p>OTOH, we have sent <i>robots</i> and we know the underlying physics very well indeed. We have also sent an electric car with a test dummy wearing a flight-suit into a Mars-crossing orbit. If Musk had actually wanted to continue with the Red Dragon concept (which IIRC wasn&#x27;t planned to be crewed), it could&#x27;ve already landed by now.<p>We also know what it would take to go substantially faster, and that we either don&#x27;t have the tech (e.g. fusion), or don&#x27;t want to risk it (e.g. fission), or we can&#x27;t afford it (e.g. non-rocket launch systems). Even if we had more advanced propulsion, significantly faster trips are more likely to be exceptions than the rule until we have enough infrastructure in space that Mars itself <i>stops being an interesting destination</i>.\n\n      &gt; &quot;Hull losses&quot; due to cosmic dust are basically zero, the only recorded instances are on low Earth orbit due to space debris.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong about that, but…<p>&gt; with some dangerous shoals&#x2F;rocks thrown in for good measure.<p>Pretty much describes the landing phase and why so many mars and moon probes failed, while<p>&gt; mostly water and wind<p>describes many launch failures, and also the initial failures to land on Venus (modulo that the Venusian atmosphere at ground level is past the critical point and no longer distinguishably either liquid or gas, but it&#x27;s CO2 not H2O).\n\n    You&#x27;re <i>dramatically</i> underestimating how dangerous sea travel was. Millions of people lost their lives at sea, up to and including during the Age of Sail where we had been doing it for millennia. For instance Vasco de Gamma was the first person to discover a route from Europe to India. And that&#x27;s relatively easy since you can get there by simply following the coast from Africa onward to India.<p>He set out with 170 men and 4 ships. 55 men and 2 ships returned. And that was not particularly remarkable - scurvy, inclement weather, rogue waves, supplies going bad, and countless other issues meant death at sea was a regular part of traveling at sea. Magellan is another one. We all learn in school that he was the first man to cross the globe. What we don&#x27;t necessarily learn is that he didn&#x27;t survive the voyage. He set out with 5 ships and 270 men - 18 men, not including Magellan, and 1 ship returned.<p>Exploration and ultimately colonization has never been something for those unwilling to risk it all, and it may very likely never be. The entire point of such things is that you&#x27;re setting out to do and discover what has not been done, and what has not been discovered. In this context it&#x27;s essentially impossible to have any assurance of safety.\n\n      Well actually it’s more likely that Enrique of Malacca was the first person to circumnavigate the globe.<p>(He had been enslaved by Magellan 10 years earlier on a voyage which had reached Malacca going east, and then returned on the later more famous voyage of Magellan which had gone west.)\n\n      To be fair, many of them were killed while engaged in colonialist island warfare rather than the voyage itself so even setting foot on an island to replenish had its dangers, same for Cook. I&#x27;d say space travel has many more dangers in the voyage than warrior aliens.\n\n        Magellan notwithstanding, relatively few of his crew were lost to natives. Most of it came from starvation and scurvy. The latter of which, alone, took millions of lives. Both were greatly compounded because of how unpredictable the seas can be. For instance when crossing the Indian Ocean the first time, Vasco da Gamma initially took about 3 weeks. On his way back he ran into foul weather, and the exact same journey ended up taking more than 4 months. He ended up losing about half his crew just during that crossing.<p>We&#x27;re almost certainly much more technically prepared for space flight than the early explorers were for these great sea voyages. And we&#x27;re certainly <i>vastly</i> more economically prepared. The only difference is the risk tolerance and funding. Those sailors and captains setting out always understood there was a <i>very</i> real chance that they would never return, and that was simply accepted. And funding was never easy back in the day, but the costs were also much greater relatively speaking. The fantasy this article speaks of about multi-century ships setting out into the stars is something we could achieve for a <i>tiny</i> fraction of what we spend on random wars, yet we don&#x27;t.\n\n        Notwithstanding battles, a napoleonic era British Royal Navy Man-o-war with ~750 sailors would expect to lose something like 1 man a fortnight to accidents and disease for the duration of the voyage. To make up the numbers they would press-gang fishermen wherever they happened to be around the globe. As a result the Royal Navy was surprisingly multi racial in that era.<p>The BBC had a series called ‘who do you think you are’ where they analysed people’s DNA and some of the best episodes were right wing figures finding out they were 25% polynesian or whatever, I always wondered if this was partly due to the press-gang on-the-hoof practices of the Navy.\n\n      You are underestimating the dangers of long distance space travel.<p>It doesn’t matter if ‘sea travel’ included people juggling flaming chainsaws, it’s still not even in the same league.\n\n        No, I don&#x27;t believe I am. If you have any mind, I do love discussing these topics. In particular I&#x27;d posit that the great sea explorers were setting out with far less information, far less knowledge of the dangers that awaited them, and with far less capability for reconciling those dangers. Something like scurvy, whose cure&#x2F;cause wouldn&#x27;t be completely understood until the early 20th century (!!!), was just an absolutely devastating issue. It could kill within months and nobody had any clue of what or why it was happening. It&#x27;s just that you go to sea, your body starts rotting in some of the most painful ways imaginable, and you die relatively shortly thereafter. And that was just a part of life at sea!\n\n  Only in a hand-wavy roughly analogous kind of way. The devil is in the details. We are just not evolved for an environment like space:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body#:~:text=Additional%20symptoms%20include%20fluid%20redistribution,sleep%20disturbance%2C%20and%20excess%20flatulence\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the...</a>.<p>Even with air and food and shielded from the vast majority of radiation, space is just not great for human comfort or mid to long term survival.\n\n    I mean, we&#x27;re not biologically adapted for the open ocean or winters above the arctic circle either. If all you&#x27;re living in is your skin, then a Siberian winter will kill you in under 15 minutes. It takes a crazy amount of technology -- in terms of habitat-building and wearables -- to be able to survive in that environment. Yet humans were doing it 47,000 years ago.<p>So these kind of biological arguments really don&#x27;t hold. We&#x27;re not constrained by our biology. That ship has <i>sailed</i>, literal aeons ago. We&#x27;re constrained by our technology, and in technological terms, relative to our evolutionary cradle, Inuit garb is about 80% of the way towards being a space suit. Doesn&#x27;t mean that space is &quot;easy&quot;. Just that &quot;easy&quot; isn&#x27;t what we <i>do</i>.\n\n      It’s apples and oranges. Many, many human cultures live close to the water but none live on or in it exclusively, we are no longer an aquatic species. I think the arctic comparison might be more apt, but even so, it is such a staggering difference of degree. The amount of technology required to learn how to hunt arctic wildlife, preserve food, and turn animal skins into clothing and shelter is not trivial. But it is nothing compared to having to replicate our entire habitat in space. Food, water and air are the minimum in terms of long term survival; there are so many other heath  considerations in the micro-gravitational radioactive vacuum of space.<p>Edit: also Inuit garb being 80% space suit is just… what(?!?). How do you quantify that? The main features they share is that insulates from extreme cold temperatures and can protect against glare, but our space suits also insulate from high temperatures and provide life support and are air tight and radiation resistant and… this assertion is just nonsense.\n\n    &quot;Build a vessel that suits the environment&quot; is a big difference. One person can build boat that can sail across the ocean. A team can build a ship that will do it safely. People sail across the ocean on canoes.<p>Space ships are a whole other level of technology that we don&#x27;t have but have ideas on how to build.<p>Starships are level where we don&#x27;t know if can be built. We have ideas, but those ideas aren&#x27;t possible with achievable technology. It is quite possible that not possible with any technology.\n\n  Your comment reminds me of &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot; by Robert Heinlein.<p>Which is to say, crazy reductive.\n\n  Space kinds of looks like sea ( danger being always present and you&#x27;re alone to face it) but it&#x27;s also very different for the following reason:<p>&gt; Viewed like that, asteroids are kinda like islands, where some fresh fruit, timber etc may be found. Adventurers may like it &amp; hang there while the ship sails on.<p>They are very much unlike islands: on an island humans get back to there land-dweller lifestyle, they can get food, fresh, water materials and they are safe from the danger of the sea. An asteroid offers none of that, you cannot just get spare parts on the asteroid, nor food and it&#x27;s as dangerous as before (void, radiations). In fact, except for dedicated machines designed to mine them, it&#x27;s very unlikely anyone ever lands on an asteroid because it gives you practically no benefit over floating in space and is very costly in terms of propulsion (both to land and to leave, because you need to get to the speed of the asteroid and then leave it).\n\nThat was unexpectedly charming.<p>Something hinted at, here, and something I&#x27;ve only recently come to accept, is that we - we humans - <i>are</i> Earth. I mean, literally, we&#x27;re systems of systems composed of stuff that&#x27;s Earth stuff. And of course many interlocking systems besides, all made of the same stuff.<p>Separate a portion of the larger system, and the component will not retain the original&#x27;s complexity - it will lose complexity to entropy, and revert to the mean.<p>Along those same lines, imagine, just for a second, a completely separated other Earth, and the systems interlocked inside it. Now imagine those, mixing with ours, all those interlocking systems, interfering, constructively and deconstructively. There&#x27;s only one way that shakes out[1]. It&#x27;s not great.<p>I&#x27;m not saying interstellar voyaging is impossible. I just think it&#x27;s impossible for us, as human animals, as Earth systems. But Earth systems are not the only systems that exist. Our technological systems have a leg up, in that they can be developed on a substrate of understanding beyond just the crust of the one planet. Technological systems have better messaging between systems, and they can make at least an attempt at centralized control. A technological surrogate will be the one to experience other suns. Something that remembers us, and maybe remembers us well enough it can pretend to be human occasionally.<p>I suppose that sounds nice, in the same way the traditional blue-sky-golden-gate-fluffy-cloud-big-bearded-old-chap afterlife sounds nice. But God, it also sounds patronizing as all hell. Just put me in the ground so I can help the garden. See, as I get older, watched things die and grow, I&#x27;ve come to realize: the afterlife quantifiably exists . . but you don&#x27;t get to be selfish about it.<p>[1] Not counting technological solutions, like genetic engineering and, failing that, the magical realm of nanowhatever, although I suspect nanowhatsit will act an awful lot like living systems, which are of course their own sort of nanothingy\n\n  This is a bunch of magical thinking.<p>&gt;  I just think it&#x27;s impossible for us<p>You think whatever you want but your reasoning is not convincing.<p>What makes technology not of Earth? It is “just systems of systems composed of stuff that&#x27;s Earth stuff“.\n\n    Is it possible to even approximate a universal&#x2F;perfect insulator? If not, then there will always be some situation in the universe that will have some effect on a static entity, unless it stops being static by adapting. Now, in terms of human bodies, these adaptations may be quite fundamental (i.e. on a genetic level)\n\n      Adaptation is just another word for &quot;complexity breeds complexity,&quot; which is just more words for &quot;entropy,&quot; which is just another description of all fading to static white noise background radiation, until it all fades into the heat death of the universe.<p>The question is whether you choose to resist entropy and slow down, or embrace entropy and burn bright.<p>Whichever path you choose, make the most of it my friends!\n\n    &quot;Earth stuff&quot; was bad phrasing on my part. The actual dichotomy is &quot;naturally evolved systems&quot; versus &quot;designed systems&quot;. I might be an optimist, but I <i>DO</i> think <i>designed systems</i> can self-sustain in space. Not today- the tech isn&#x27;t there yet - but soon. However, <i>naturally evolved systems</i> - like humans, non-bioengineered humans - I don&#x27;t think will make it past a few generations, or, if you move a HUGE generation ship, a few thousand years. But it&#x27;s always going to have a &quot;use by&quot; date without designed systems integrating with the naturally evolved systems.<p>When it comes to ALIEN natural systems, all bets are off. Who the hell knows what happens when we interact with that - even super-duper-ultra-tech designed systems might not be able to correct in time if two completely alien biologies interact destructively.<p>Curious though: what else was &quot;magical thinking&quot;? That&#x27;s something I take pretty seriously - unless I&#x27;m doing it recreationally, which I am not - so I don&#x27;t want to leave it hanging out for the universe to see.\n\n  Cybernetics&#x2F;transhumanism (merging tech tooling and human biology) are how I envision us going to the stars. I hope consciousness is transferrable.\n\n    My cells have changed over enough to say with some degree of assurance that, Ship of Theseus style, consciousness is indeed quite transferable, but at the same time, you will never be the same person today that you were yesterday.\n\n  I’d be happy if we just start with long term orbitals. Build structures in space nearby (say L5) and try obtain self sufficiency. Then build more and move them farther out. Once you can survive in the Oort Cloud, interstellar travel becomes just a matter of time.<p>Any dreams of small ships and small populations colonizing planets are just dreams. Unless we develop magic replication technology that takes raw elements and builds compounds an atom at a time.\n\n    Oh God the hubris of humans.<p>Here&#x27;s an idea: how about we start with a (at least seemingly) much smaller task: can we even try to genuinely be concerned about the (physically) preventable deaths of millions of people each year? And note, I&#x27;m not even talking about doing something about it, I am deliberately setting the bar only at <i>trying(!)</i> to be <i>concerned</i> (though: <i>genuine</i> concern).<p>Baby steps.\n\n      Even if you re-directed all resources, all leisure, everything beyond bare minimum of survival into keeping as many people possible alive as long as possible, <i>everyone</i> will still die.<p>So who’s to decide what we should sacrifice to keep others alive?\n\n        The above poster specifically wrote &quot;physically preventable&quot;, so as an advocate for mass human sacrifice, how many do you think it&#x27;ll take to make an experimental bouncy castle in space?<p>Do you envision yourself as more of an Acceptable Human Sacrifice type, or Guy Who Enjoys The Bouncy Castle type?\n\n          &quot;Physically preventable&quot; is a moving target. The more resources are invested in preventing currently preventable deaths, the more farther away the target moves, because more and more causes of death become preventable. So, this is a false argument. There&#x27;s no preventing all preventable deaths.<p>Let me give you a different argument: what would it take to prevent absolutely ALL car-related deaths? Before you answer, be aware that even ambulances that mostly save lives sometimes cause deadly accidents.<p>How many deaths would be prevented in the long term (let&#x27;s take 2000 years, equal time period since Roman Empire until today) if we choose to go to space and accept a big increase in death risks for those pioneers, instead of preventing deaths on earth?<p>How about this argument: How many improvements in medicine that make those deaths preventable today came from United States, Canada, South America or were funded by those states? If sailors from the middle ages didn&#x27;t risk their lives to cross the ocean and discover America, would we have today&#x27;s medicine, 500 years later? How many lives would have been lost without it?\n\n            Do you genuinely believe that when people say &quot;we have very pressing issues about preventable human suffering&quot;, that they&#x27;re saying &quot;we should literally bring all forms of suffering to absolute zero before we do literally anything else&quot;?<p>Personally I simply don&#x27;t know of anybody who actually hold that view, because it&#x27;s obviously a nonsensical way to approach the issue. I do however keep seeing people strawman it into existence to dunk on it with the exact points you typed out here. What is being achieved by insisting that perfection is impossible, therefore we shouldn&#x27;t try at all? Just the comfort of not having to think too hard about it?\n\n              How else should anyone answer that? Whatever improvement are done (and you can&#x27;t deny that there are continuous improvements), a person with that view will always find that &quot;more&quot; could be done. They don&#x27;t actually say that they want perfection, but actually that&#x27;s the same as always saying &quot;more could be done&quot;.\n\n                We are already preventing 99% of preventable deaths. As you say, most ‘preventable deaths’ we prevent just turn into a new later more creative preventable death. In many cities you can be homeless and have better mortality prevention than a medieval king.<p>I don’t know how people think that we’ll draw a line somewhere clear. It is (and should always be) a moving target.<p>I think most progress has this moving goalpost. Because of this, we need to multitask as a civilization. We can’t just focus on ‘safety is number 1’… because we’ll never do anything else.\n\n                  &gt; We are already preventing 99% of preventable deaths.<p>How did you measure this?\n\n                    Honestly a mental swag. To put actual numbers in it, life expectancy was 20 years, now 80 years.<p>That means roughly 0.9% chance a of death per year now, vs 3.4% ancestrally. Thats 73% of deaths avoided per year. I think that compounds year over year since those people who would otherwise have did are also alive to avoid more deaths.<p>So, even at the indisputable low end… 73%.\n\n                      Your claim above:<p>&gt; We are already preventing 99% of preventable deaths.<p>Makes an implicit claim of <i>optimality on an absolute basis</i>.  What you posted here <i>doesn&#x27;t even try</i> to prove that claim, at best it only proves a <i>relative</i> improvement.\n\n                I have to say, this just reads as a thought-terminater happening on your end - we evidently live in a world where even people who strongly believe more should be done to stop human suffering ARE RIGHT NOW engaged in doing all kinds of other stuff not directly going towards preventing that, including assigning non-negligible amounts of resources to said stuff. Obviously the opposition is a question of the relative perceived scale of the expense of X to other problems Y, rather than literally wanting an indefinite Achilles-and-turtle race to perfection.<p>It&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t do more than one thing, it&#x27;s that if we are gonna devote massive amounts of resources to some grand scale project, there are disagreements about what&#x27;s more pressing.<p>Now personally I do believe becoming interstellar should be one of our shared goals, and that it will be good for us (and the rest of the biosphere) long term. However, I really think that &quot;nevermind the starving kids they will die anyway, it is what it is, focus on space instead&quot; is gonna actively deteriorate our chances of ever getting anything done because it comes off as deeply detached and cruel.<p>You know what would be a tangible benefit of automated asteroid mining? Making child-powered cobalt mines obsolete in a flash, and full-stopping the environmental devastation of stripmining on earth. These are vastly better selling points than &quot;there is no such thing as zero suffering&quot;.\n\n                  &gt; this just reads as a thought-terminater happening on your end<p>That&#x27;s exactly what it is. Not just that &quot;more could be done&quot; is always true, but it&#x27;s irrelevant at the same time, because what they propose - taking resources from space agencies and sending truck-loads of food - won&#x27;t do any good to those children. It will probably just fuel more war and terrorism and more schemes to divert those money to opaque bank accounts in some tropical country.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t do more than one thing, it&#x27;s that if we are gonna devote massive amounts of resources to some grand scale project, there are disagreements about what&#x27;s more pressing.<p>Can&#x27;t just ignore a project because it&#x27;s not &quot;pressing&quot;. And, btw, it IS pressing. We have 50 year of oil left with no alternative that is nearly as good as diesel. Do you tink that mankind can support a grand scale project after that?<p>&gt; [...] is gonna actively deteriorate our chances of ever getting anything done because it comes off as deeply detached and cruel.<p>More cruel than it is now? More cruel than current wars and genocide (you know which ones, I won&#x27;t name them). People already don&#x27;t care, except for having their iSomething to brag about. How many children were exploited for all the copper in those devices? Did the buyers care? How many people went to buy FairPhone instead?<p>I think a big project like this is the only thing that can still unite most of the people. I hope China does it first so we could have a race again, like it  happend in the 60&#x27;s.<p>&gt; You know what would be a tangible benefit of automated asteroid mining? Making child-powered cobalt mines obsolete in a flash, [...]<p>Yes, but people still won&#x27;t care.\n\n                  &gt; Now personally I do believe becoming interstellar should be one of our shared goals, and that it will be good for us (and the rest of the biosphere) long term. However, I really think that &quot;nevermind the starving kids they will die anyway, it is what it is, focus on space instead&quot; is gonna actively deteriorate our chances of ever getting anything done because it comes off as deeply detached and cruel.<p>Your intuition is correct, <i>but there&#x27;s even more reasons that that</i>.  I will use a movie clip to introduce what I would try to do if &quot;we&quot; &quot;decided&quot; to set off on an unnecessary interstellar voyage <i>prior to taking care of people (particularly children) here on Earth first</i>:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bdcE3VyKv5U\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bdcE3VyKv5U</a><p>And why would I do this?<p>a) bfytw - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=BFYTW\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=BFYTW</a><p>b) Some other reasons that are more well thought out<p>Humans would be well advised to not forget (or, <i>learn in the first place</i>) that it is MUCH easier to wreck things than it is to build them.  I recommend &quot;measuring twice and cutting once&quot;, as my grand daddy always told me.<p>PS: I should really try to be not such a pessimist&#x2F;asshole, so I will also include this clip from the same movie as a counter-balance:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Et4sMJP9FmM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Et4sMJP9FmM</a>\n\n            (Note: I am a different Human than the one you are replying to - apologies for interjecting.)<p>&gt; &quot;Physically preventable&quot; is a moving target.<p>So are rockets and artillery shells, but check this out:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iron_Dome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iron_Dome</a><p>Humans <i>can be</i> very clever <i>and generous</i> ($60,000 USD per interceptor missile, hoo baby!!

To make sense (if you can pardon the colloquialism) of this argument, I think it would help if you gave a quantitative example to prove that your fact is actually factual.  My intuition is that you may be conflating [1] physical death (concrete) with causes of death (abstract).<p>&gt; So, this is a false argument.<p>A problem for you - some of us know of this phenomenon:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_and_indirect_realism\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_and_indirect_realism</a><p>...<i>and not just abstractly</i>.

The traffic is bad. The ambulance is late. The person dies before reaching the hospital. IF there was an emergency hospital closer, or a highway nearby that leads to the hospital and improves the traffic in the area, that person could still be alive. That death could be prevented. Let&#x27;s imagine that a hospital or highway is built. The ambulance arrives in time and saves his&#x2F;her life. But then, accidents happen everywhere. With that hospital or highway built, a person that has the exact same accident, only this time is X miles away from the NEW hospital - that was previously unpreventable, no ambulance had a chance to get there in time - becomes preventable now with another hospital and&#x2F;or highway. Because: we did it before, why not do it again?<p>&gt; if preventable death was about to pay a visit to your doorstep, would you like for someone to step in and stop it?<p>Yes, obviously. No person that is emotionally involved would answer differently. Fortunately, the persons that make decisions in this matter are (usually) not emotionally involved. If they are, they (usually) take the morally corrupt way of improving services for their location, or situation, with resources that could better cover a larger area&#x2F;population.<p>&gt; During the COVID pandemic &#x2F; mass psychological phenomenon [1] a few years back, were you pro-vaxx or anti-vaxx?<p>Niether. My opinion is that vccines should be free, people should be allowed to vaxx or not, but if they choose not to vaxx, and they get sick with the disease, they should pay the &lt;cost of treatment&gt; * &lt;vaxx efficiency %&gt;. AFAIK, this was never applied.<p>&gt; I might ask you a similar question about children dying globally from malnutrition.<p>I&#x27;m not getting the point you are trying to make. All NASA&#x27;s money would only save a few of them, while increasing truck accidents, polution, forests cuts for agriculture, and probably terrorism too. Child malnutrition is not preventable today in my opinion, not unless developed countries stop exploiting their countries - but that doesn&#x27;t require NASA&#x27;s resources.<p>&gt; Should we care about such things, and if so: why should we care about them?<p>Some people care about the future and some don&#x27;t. Some care about the future, but only the immediate future. Some care about the future for their remaining estimated life time (après moi, le déluge). Some care about the far future of humanity. I consider myself in the last category.<p>Concerning the far future of humanity, the more variation in everything, the better. Uniformity, global-&lt;anything&gt;, and Earth-only is very bad, because it all falls apart at the same time in the same way. We should colonise space, have other economic systems than capitalism around the world, have some kings, have some dictators, have rich, have poor, have safe cities, have death zones, have peace in some coutries, have war in others, have free mandatory vaxx in some places, have no vaxx at all in others. See what works and what doesn&#x27;t. What good does it do if nobody vaccinates and we all die in the next pandemic and what good does it do if we all vaxx and the vaccine is bad and kills us all? What good is global peace if we don&#x27;t invest in rocket engines, guidance systems, GPS and crypto, and what good is a global war that destroys the entire planet? I would like that future people have a choice, if what they want is to move to Mars.<p>[1] No, I&#x27;m not an AI.\n\n        &gt; Even if you re-directed all resources, all leisure, everything beyond bare minimum of survival into keeping as many people possible alive as long as possible, everyone will still die.<p>True; similarly, even if everyone will still die, the airspeed velocity of an unladen European swallow is still ~20.1 miles per hour.  Mother Nature has a cruel side to her, I do not deny it.<p>&gt; So who’s to decide what we should sacrifice to keep others alive?<p>How about everyone decides?\n\n      The foundational idea of capitalism is that each person doing their own thing is automatically aligned with the betterment of us all.<p>This is, strictly speaking, incorrect; but despite the many various examples of it going wrong, it has also been a major part of the overall increase in living standards since 95% of us ploughed fields for the other 5%.<p>There are fewer people in abject poverty today than there were back then, not just as a percentage but as an absolute number. We live longer, childbearing is less dangerous and we have painkillers for it and other things, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not evenly distributed; but even though the system which was founded on even distribution failed harder than capitalism (IMO for the same reason capitalism isn&#x27;t quite right: nobody really knew about game theory until Nash), we have still eliminated one disease entirely, and are close with some others.\n\n        Very clever excuse, well done.<p>I will add ~1% more cleverness: take capitalism, and make one small change: eliminate one(!) class of hypocrisy: convert our fake concern for the well being of other humans into the real thing: stop war, get a roof <i>of some kind</i> over every person&#x27;s head, food <i>of some sort</i> into their bellies, and put some <i>genuine</i> effort into ensuring that this is substantively permanent.<p>&quot;Impossible, because {some meme magic}!&quot; many will say, but I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s a trick that can change this game we find ourselves in: <i>stop speaking untruthfully</i>.  I&#x27;m a big fan of this challenge, because people (particularly <i>smart</i> people) like to criticize it for how simplistic or stupid it is, but I know something they don&#x27;t: ~all Humans have some sort of an innate fear of non-untruthfulness, and while they&#x27;ll <i>confidently</i> talk shit about the idea all day long, <i>they never have the balls to actually try it</i>.\n\n          I wish that was &quot;one small change&quot;.<p>Evidence that it isn&#x27;t: all of human history dating back well before we had writing.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s a trick that can change this game we find ourselves in: <i>stop speaking untruthfully</i>.<p>I, too, follow this one weird trick.<p>Evidence that people who are willing to lie to my face get power by doing so:<p>* Basically all politicians, but specifically Boris Johnson — people like me even saw and called out the lies at the time, and yet, there he was, being Prime Minister<p>* Bernie Madoff, until he was finally caught<p>* Sun Tzu, The Art of War<p>The second you can argue is capitalism.

It will provide safe opportunity to master environmental control before testing in production, as well as means to supply habitable megastructures cheaply.<p>Imagine a ~km wide cylinder just sticking up in Sahara, and inside it is New Shenzhen.

About only metric out of norm was network traffic - but lack of detailed instrumentation meant we couldn&#x27;t really isolate the cause to specific container or process\n\n    If the only explanation someone can provide is that &quot;a cluster is slow&quot;, the issue isn&#x27;t with network observability. They need to do at least the minimum level of analysis before escalating.\n\n      Unfortunately we were the right team for escalation <i>before</i> escalating to network team.\n\n      Yes, that would be great, but unfortunately there are application teams (particularly in the enterprise) lacking such tact when blaming infrastructure for issues.<p>Good old silos are alive and well, and ownership is not always part of the culture.\n\n        In our case the <i>expected</i> golden path is that once our team figures the proper procedure, we will establish it for the downstream teams that are direct supports of the application teams.<p>So at least in theory things are somewhat well set up, but there&#x27;s too much siloing at our level (wildly separate network teams, teams for specific clouds, etc.)\n\n  Haven&#x27;t used this but I tried out Pixie trying to debug where outgoing traffic was coming from and where it was going and was fairly successful although Pixie wasn&#x27;t very stable&#x2F;had a lot of issues causing crashes.<p>In this case, we had a couple services talking to 3rd party services running on AWS so it wasn&#x27;t obvious from generic flow logs.<p>I also used Lacework a couple years ago which is eBPF based and it was pretty trivial to see things phoning home or one off maintenance where a new connection was being initiated.\n\n  It’s like Cilium + Hubble but useful for you don’t&#x2F;can’t run cilium. Uses eBPF to collect metrics and stats on what flows where, can record an impressive amount of stuff, without any required instrumentation of your applications. Amazingly handy for when you run both first party and 3rd party apps in your K8s cluster. The network maps these tools produce are handy too.<p>Although, Cilium is pretty great, so not sure why you wouldn’t run it, given the option…\n\n    Cillium has been bought out by Cisco, so its monetization is only a matter of time.<p>Also, not everyone needs to implement a service mesh.\n\n      Neither Cilium nor Hubble are service meshes.<p>Cilium is a CNI - the functionality that provides the K8s cluster inter-pod networking. The fact that it uses eBPF to deliver its functionality is what gives it the impressive observability you usually only get from a service mesh. I agree that not everyone needs a service mesh.\n\n        You are right that cilium is a CNI but one of its many features is also providing a sidecar-less service mesh using eBPF. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cilium.io&#x2F;use-cases&#x2F;service-mesh&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cilium.io&#x2F;use-cases&#x2F;service-mesh&#x2F;</a>\n\n      Cillium is a CNCF project and Apache 2 licensed.

Something called bpfman aims to address this aspect\n\n  I&#x27;ve used this in OpenShift and it is -very- neat.  Saved incredible amounts of time trying to solve problems.\n\n  You can also check out DeepFlow [1], where we implemented distributed tracing for microservices using eBPF, which of course also includes observability of K8s networks.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepflow.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepflow.io</a>\n\nWhat&#x27;s the performance impact of using VM-based eBPF for these tasks instead of native code?\n\n  Linux eBPF is JIT&#x27;d. It has native performance.\n\n    Even WASM doesn&#x27;t have native performance, so I question this claim."

      "conversation_text": "Maybe they should use an AI to automate moderation.\n\n  Yes, they should have a GPT that runs other GPT&#x27;s, an Universal GPT we could call it.<p>They do use some sort of automation according to the article<p>&gt; We use a combination of automated systems, human review and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies.\n\n    Then they can market this universal GPT as an AGI.\n\n  It is a bit funny that if you apply for a job with many of these companies they ask they you do not use AI for the application.\n\n    As any company should. Not sure what&#x27;s funny about it - I&#x27;m interested in the person. If using AI is one of required capabilities I will ask them to perform a task using it during the interview so I can review their process. In the same way I don&#x27;t expect to receive an executable binary as a cover letter for a SWE position.<p>I had many candidates submit absolutely terrible cover letters clearly made by ChatGPT. The number one sign - it talks about their experience exactly in the order I listed it on the job post; number two - I don&#x27;t get to know anything about the person. I asked them to submit a cover letter they wrote themselves, and while not everyone&#x27;s writing was as good as ChatGPT can write, I got to know the person, and hired few of these who definitely wouldn&#x27;t make the cut if I went by the AI made letter.<p>If you can have AI generate your letter so well I can&#x27;t tell, you get a pass. Nobody was able to do that yet, though (or at least didn&#x27;t admit to it, even though I&#x27;m asking after they are hired and saying that at this point it would only help them if they did so).\n\n      most companies are using AI to filter out CVs these days, and cover letters written with ChatGPT seem to have a higher success ratio. I wouldn&#x27;t blame anyone for using it, unfortunately.\n\n        Maybe in first rounds. I am the third&#x2F;fourth round interviewer. If a cover letter like that gets to me, it&#x27;s automatically a no - not because of the fact itself but simply because the cover letters are terrible.\n\n          In a third round, why are you even looking at cover letters?\n\n            Who is even looking at cover letters at all?\n\n              I suspect it depends on the field, but in my experience it’s often a good indicator of success. A shoddy letter betrays a lack of professionalism. If you’re not going to spend 10 minutes running a spell checker it means that either it’s not important to you, so good bye, or that your standards are really low and you will keep producing garbage if I hire you, so good bye as well.<p>The problem with cover letters is false positive (people who did not write the letter themselves, or who did it to a much higher standard than their usual). But then, that’s what interviews are for.<p>I did hire a couple of people with either a subpar CV (some good people sometimes end up in dead ends or difficult situations), or cover letter (not everyone is a great writer), or reference (your issues with your former boss are not always your fault), or interview (you can have a bad day), so I would not rely on a single factor. But a combination of 2 dodgy elements is an automatic rejection. Each one tends to surface different aspects.\n\n                Consider that job seekers today sometimes have to apply to hundreds of positions before being hired. For most of those applications, they won’t hear anything back. Given that dynamic, would you spend time polishing a cover letter for each application?\n\n                  My recent job hunt was over 1700 applications.<p>Nobody is spending 10 minutes writing a cover letter.<p>Companies that are getting hundreds to thousands of applications are not reading every cover letter.\n\n                  In my field, certainly. We expect them to prepare a presentation for the interview as well. Our pond is not large enough, there are not hundreds of positions to apply to.\n\n                I guess my thing is that I don’t want to jump through hoops, I want to write code. You know how some people are enamored of those little ‘shit tests’ for relationships, they think they’re really clever? I have no patience for that.<p>Show me who you are and I’ll show you who I am, and if we like eachother, then let’s try to get together and see what we could build together. if the entire interview process is a series of hoops that you dictate I jump through to even have a <i>chance</i> with you, then why should I expect my future with you to be any different? I don’t want that.<p>I don’t want to write a carefully crafted letter pretending that I want anything other than respect and money and a chance to do work on interesting from a potential employer. I just want to write code. The rest of it is extensive shit testing in my book and I have no patience for that. I don’t put up with that kind of treatment from anyone else - what makes you think dangling money in front of me would change my mind about that?\n\n            A guess: First round was &quot;AI&quot; (aka keyword matching), second round was recruiter who doesn&#x27;t understand anything and doesn&#x27;t read\n\n              First round is phone call prescreen, second round is non-technical interview with a recruiter. No GPT or keyword matching involved.\n\n            How am I supposed to learn something about the person?\n\n              at the third or fourth round? By talking to them, obviously?\n\n                Before I get to talk to them, obviously\n\n                  You have a CV, three rounds of notes, usually a linkedin profile, and you’re arrogant enough to dismiss people because they <i>had</i> to put up a crappy cover letter to get past your stupid ATS, and you still don’t see how shameful your behavior is.\n\n                    Lol. If all you can give me is a crap letter that says nothing about you and just lists what I wrote in the ad and how excellent you are at it, then I&#x27;m going to go with the people who excitedly told me about their actual experience and related interests. Don&#x27;t see anything shameful about that.<p>CV is nice except that most people have a list of &quot;Senior Software Engineer at XYZ&quot; and that&#x27;s it. Doesn&#x27;t tell me anything, so again, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going with, I&#x27;m going to prefer the person who took the time to actually talk about their related experience and interests. LinkedIn is nice but same problem as with CVs.<p>Seems like you think everyone has perfect detailed CV and LinkedIn profiles... Nope. It&#x27;s mostly crap that says nothing. If your CV&#x2F;LinkedIn can take the role of the cover letter then sure, no problem, but I don&#x27;t see that often.<p>Not sure how the recruiter&#x27;s notes about your nice friendly  outgoing personality and good English level would help me understand your experience and interests related to the job, but yeah sure lol.<p>No crappy ATS at our company, BTW. Applications go to the inbox and are handled by real people.\n\n              Google, I think that&#x27;s the 9th round.\n\n          Don’t you see how the incentives become impossible? The AI stage needs you to be as obvious and direct about your experience as possible, the human stage gets irritated when you write like the reader doesn’t have a brain.<p>Personally I send my resumes through a gpt with the job posting and ask if I’d be a good fit. Almost always the GPT will initially say no because I’m using some terminology that anyone in the industry would understand is a form of the posting’s requirements, but the GPT does not. But then perhaps the screening recruiter doesn’t either. So why not be specific? But then anyone else at the company might think I’m a moron… ugh.\n\n      &gt; The number one sign - it talks about their experience exactly in the order I listed it on the job post<p>I wouldn&#x27;t attribute that to AI; it&#x27;s a very natural way to write a cover letter. You want to hit the bullet points in the job posting, and the most logical way to do that is to go down the list and check boxes.\n\n        Yes, but this goes much further - on a word by word, sentence by sentence basis.\n\n          I&#x27;ve never seen that from an LLM; usually the error they make is I&#x27;ve asked them for too many things (a quantity which varies wildly), I get a response for about 3 of those things and a note saying something to the effect of &quot;put more here&quot;.\n\n          A very common piece of advice is to include keywords in your resume in exactly the way they are typed in the advertisement. This is because of places that use ATS systems to filter down the &quot;best&quot; candidates based on how closely their skill set matches the requirements. For example, if the requirement says &quot;Must have proficiency in the Python scientific computing ecosystem, including TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn,&quot; if you subscribe to the keyword methodology, you&#x27;d make sure to sprinkle in the exact phrase &quot;Python scientific computing ecosystem&quot; on the off chance that some non-domain-expert in HR copied and pasted into their ATS.<p>I can see how someone would take that advice and include exact phrases in their cover letter in an attempt to get through the filters.\n\n    This could be a way to separate the wheat from the chaff - if your AI can be detected through your writing, then you aren&#x27;t who they&#x27;re looking for!\n\n      I&#x27;ve been trying to get Gemini to write things for me. It&#x27;s either way to formal, passive, and evasive, but if you ask it to be less formal its like &quot;Yo dude, give me a job!&quot;.<p>I find it quite hard find a middle ground and write in a style I like.\n\n  on that note, will only bother with AI when &quot;open&quot;ai announces an AI ceo.\n\n    Then you&#x27;ve set your standards way too high.<p>Loads of places hire interns, no sane person would make an intern CEO. LLMs today are kinda like weird interns at every subject all at once.\n\n      who wants to pay for weird interns? even good ones are free. and might even grow to good hires.\n\n        Paid internships are common, and LLMs are so much cheaper than humans they might as well be free.<p>The prices on OpenAI&#x27;s website are listed per <i>million</i> tokens, the cheaper model can read a typical book for less than the cost of that book in paperback, second hand, during a closing down discount sale, and even the fancy model is still in range of a cheap second-hand paperback (just not during a closing-down sale) for reading and just about the price of a <i>new</i> cheap paperback for writing — cheap enough it might as well be free.<p>Plus, they&#x27;re an intern at <i>everything all at once</i>. You don&#x27;t get to hire someone who has a late-degree-level grasp of programming (in every major programming language at the same time) <i>and</i> genetics <i>and</i> law <i>and</i> physics <i>and</i> medicine <i>and</i> who has a business-level grasp of <i>all</i> the most common written languages on Earth — there is no such human.<p>(If and when we can make an AI, be it an LLM or otherwise, which can act at the level of a senior in whichever field it was trained on, even if that training takes a gigawatt-year to compute per field, and even if inference costs 100 kW just to reach human output speed, it&#x27;s going to seriously mess up the whole world economy; right now it&#x27;s mainly messing up the economic incentives to hire people fresh from university while boosting the amount of simple stuff that actually gets done because normal people and not just business can now also afford to hire the weird intern).<p>&gt; and might even grow to good hires.<p>Even if they do, will you be the one to hire them?<p>Also, ChatGPT has so far existed for about as long as I spent on my (paid) year in industry that formed part of my degree. It wasn&#x27;t <i>called</i> an internship, but it basically was. In that time, the models have grown and improved significantly, suggesting (but not proving, because induction doesn&#x27;t do that) that they will continue to grow and improve.\n\n  business idea: put a chatgpt plugin moderator on the store, priced for a single purchase by them.\n\n    I&#x27;m sure there is gpt to plagiarize gpt already that can be used to not use it directly.\n\nAs a (former) ChatGPT plugins developer, our business has absolutely tanked due to GPTs. Discoverability is nonexistent because search is just buried by spam. At least with plugins, there were only a few hundred to sort through, and most had some unique API they would plug into.<p>For context, we built ChatOCR- an OCR tool that lets users extract text from photos and PDFs. We made roughly $20k from 39,000 users over 6 months on the plugins catalog\n\n  Do end users have to pay you each time or buy access or credits or something, or do you just get a cut of ChatGPT paid subscriptions when a paying user uses your plugin?\n\n    We use a third party plugins manager called pluginlab.ai. It manages auth and subscriptions for plugins users by prompting them to sign in when they hit a paywall.\n\n  There&#x27;s a conflict in value proposition here, which is more drastic than the discovery issue. That might help you better contextualize the failure, and avoid similar risks in the future.<p>Namely,  GPT is now a multimodal trained llm capable of doing OCR over PDFs and images. Given the accessibility of that feature, we expect that users do not try to discover OCR plugins anymore- they feel no need.<p>Out of curiosity, what was the contingency plan in the case that OpenAI did this? What rationales did you use to estimate the likelihood and severity of that risk? Were there good reasons to discount that risk?\n\n    We knew the time would come, but we built ChatOCR in a week. If we overthought the time horizon problem, we&#x27;d have 0 users and $0.<p>But also, GPT-4-Vision is multi-modal but does not specifically use OCR. Our tool is used mostly to extract text from documents and load it into context, and we still saw growth after OpenAI built this feature into ChatGPT.\n\n      $20k for a week’s work seems more than good, no?\n\n        Whose week&#x27;s work? One person, a small team (&lt;5), or a large organization? At some point on that axis, the RoI becomes negative.\n\n          You can&#x27;t get a large organization to move fast and ship something in a week. So this was either a solo developer en devour, or at max low single digits.\n\n      Thank you for sharing your risk thinking here. I like that you are risk hungry, not prone to hesitation, and you achieved revenue on a shoe string budget.<p>I&#x27;m curious about the idea that your OCR-generated context might give better recall than whatever GPT uses to parse PDFs into context. That would support the idea that it is discoverability, and not feature parity, that is killing the product. Can we discuss benchmarks that show conclusively that your solution does better on QA accuracy with respect to a PDF, as compared to GPT4&#x27;s own PDF mode?<p>Also I&#x27;m curious about the trajectory of active users after the feature dropped from OAI. Was there an inflection point where new active users per month went negative? How long did it take before that inflection happened? Do you still have enough users to keep the service up and gathering revenue, or do you plan to mothball? Do you have any plans to pivot the offering to other markets?\n\n    What resources do you suggest for learning how to do this kind of risk analysis well?\n\n      A crystal ball.<p>Most of the times you should do what they did, build a first version in a week and see. Nobody knows the future anyway.\n\n      You should look into decision analysis with decision trees - this is a nice article on how to do it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;1964&#x2F;07&#x2F;decision-trees-for-decision-making\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;1964&#x2F;07&#x2F;decision-trees-for-decision-making</a>\n\n      My analysis of the platform risk of the ChatGPT plug-in store depends on<p>1) risk ideas like Failure Modes and risk hedging. The outcome in the plug-in store is an example of a well known failure mode of platforms that grow very fast.<p>2) remaining up to date with trends in the llm literature, so we can for instance predict that major vendors would release multimodal llms<p>3) being aware of trends in tech platform dynamics. Specifically the trend for &quot;platform enshittification&quot; - a term coined by Corey Doctorow - which is the tendency for tech monopolies to exploit their own users and vendors when they can.<p>I&#x27;ll talk about each of these a little bit more in depth.<p>General Risk Analysis<p>First I recommend reading academic business and cyber risk analysis textbooks. Not just popular business books like &quot;Anti fragile&quot; or &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (which are good), but also academic books that introduced Bayesian networks and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. You&#x27;re not going to get away from some math, but thankfully there are techniques that let you draw situations as network diagrams, which I personally find helps with my natural difficulty with mathematics and symbolic processing. You can do pretty decent risk analysis just using &quot;napkin math&quot; - rough graphical and numerical estimates that approximate risks and can sharpen your intuition.<p>I like to recommend cyber risk analysis too, since it makes sense to be able to accurately assess your organizational cyber risks as an entrepreneur. It shows us how beautiful and interdisciplinary risk management can be, and ideas like adversarial modeling, the attack kill chain, attack sequences, and the attack graph are valuable in ordinary business risk management, like coping with insider threats or adversarial competitors.<p>Technical Observation<p>Observing the development of technology is also important, and with AI we have the advantage that most of the development is happening in publicly accessible research papers on arxiv.<p>By following the AI literature and evaluating LLMs and their capabilities, I made these two observations:<p>1. Multimodal and OCR assisted LLMs were hot in the AI literature early last year, and that approach was very helpful for reducing the hallucination&#x2F;bullshitting problem - ai&#x27;s biggest usability problem to date. Some of these papers were from openai themselves.<p>From this we could assume that the major AI vendors would work very hard to integrate this feature, and suppose that third party OCR solutions would get kicked out of the market very quickly once they did. We have seen that with GPT, Gemini, Claude, and more.<p>2. GPT4 continues to beat the pants off of every single competitor, in the hundred+ benchmark papers I&#x27;ve read, in the public benchmarks like Chatbot Arena, and in my own personal and business use case benchmarking. There&#x27;s basically no contest on quality, and the result is 100% capture of the market of serious users who depend on GPT4 quality and are sophisticated enough to evaluate AI quality.<p>From this we can assume that OpenAI is well positioned to do everything it can to retain this advantage, even up to compromising developers who think it is safe to use the GPT store to build general improvements for GPT&#x27;s weaknesses.<p>To gain this technical insight, I highly recommend reading many AI papers, internalizing their insights, and if possible, working hands on with their experimental techniques. Being aware of AI&#x27;s current weaknesses and benchmarks, and being able to name papers working on overcoming specific problems, allows us to predict what might be coming next from big vendors.<p>Platform Risk Analysis<p>To gain insight into why large corporations tend to hurt their own developer communities and users when they gain the opportunity, I highly recommend Cory Doctorow&#x27;s 2023 article, &quot;The Enshittification of Tik Tok&quot;. It covers a great deal of other examples besides - including Apple and Google&#x27;s app stores which are relevant to understanding the outcome for the GPT plug in store. And it does a very good analysis of user and vendor exploiting strategies on Tik Tok.<p>Doctorow also writes a freely available book&#x2F;audiobook, &quot;The Internet Con: Seizing The Means of Comoutation&quot;, where he analyzes the issue and its contributing factors, and proposes a solution based on regulations. While his solution - heavy regulation - doesn&#x27;t seem that realistic, it&#x27;s a good analysis, especially for entrepreneurs who might want to build on top of platforms that have this form of risk.<p>Finally, here&#x27;s a paper that builds on this idea and analyzes how platforms are able to use their algorithmic control over the users attention to increasingly disadvantage a variety of stakeholders, including users, vendors, and advertisers:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;services&#x2F;aop-cambridge-core&#x2F;content&#x2F;view&#x2F;D85FE41F6CF99FC57DDFB2B2B63491C5&#x2F;S2632324924000014a.pdf&#x2F;algorithmic-attention-rents-a-theory-of-digital-platform-market-power.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;services&#x2F;aop-cambridge-core&#x2F;c...</a><p>Conclusion and Personal Strategy<p>I recommend a variety of sources including literature on risk management itself, literature having to do with the technology itself in a large variety of application domains, and being aware of market trends and forces, like the pressure to take advantage of non-financial stakeholders once a platform reaches a market dominance.<p>My general AI business strategy is to focus on my sub niche of technical work where AI has not really penetrated - automating 2d spline processing operations that have been ignored by AI researchers due to their focus on point clouds, radiance fields, bitmaps, and meshes, which are more important and applicable to a huge variety of domains. I focus on providing geometric processing services directly to manufacturers dealing with 2d vector data from CMM systems.<p>The CMM vendor I&#x27;m specializing in has been lax in adopting automation technology, and the customers I&#x27;m selling to are very reluctant to invest in improved CAD software, even when it could reduce their own labor by a factor of three or more. So between those two gaps I have a niche which I have exploited for 3 years now, and which I expect to exist for at least another 3 years. I plan to turn my CAD automation tools into an attractive product by that time, and also hope to advance the state of the art AI techniques in reverse engineering 2D splines from CMM data.<p>I hope that lets me hold on to the niche until 2030. But I also would not be very surprised if my niche gets disrupted by one of the major CAD or CMM vendors in that time.<p>My worst case outcome seems to be that I would have to join a more solidly established corporation as an research manager, strategic analyst, or software engineer. That could be an improvement in my quality of life, given that my current yearly revenues are still under 60k. However I&#x27;m going to fight that with all I&#x27;ve got, because I love owning my own company so much! I am an autistic entrepreneur, and owning my own company has been a huge breakthrough in my Independence and ability to avoid burnout. I can get by on as few as 10 hours of labor a week, which would be very hard to find in a corporation.<p>Anyways, I hope that this message has been beneficial to you even though it grew a bit long. I find Risk Management very fun and rewarding to study and apply, and hope you will as well! I wish you luck in all your endeavors!\n\n    Is OpenAI going to use the Amazon playbook of compete with the more popular products?<p>Is not publishing anything on the store in the first place the best way for risk avoidance?\n\n      &gt; Is OpenAI going to use the Amazon playbook of compete with the more popular products?<p>They overtly target universal capability for the model itself, it’d be surprising if they didn’t, within that, prioritize functionality that has demonstrated that it is in demand for use with the other existing model functionalities, which successful GPTs or plugins clearly demonstrates.\n\n  Is there a name for this rugpull that is a recurring theme in tech, when you rely solely on another service bringing attention to your service.<p>E.g. when youtube cancels you or your adwords account is blocked so you no longer make money\n\n    I&#x27;ve heard it called &quot;Platform risk&quot;.  Also &quot;Playing in someone else&#x27;s walled garden&quot;, or something along those lines.  I realize that&#x27;s not a term for the inevitable rugpull, but that&#x27;s the closest I can think of.\n\n      You live on that platform, you die on that platform.\n\n      Building your castle in someone else&#x27;s kingdom.\n\n        And obviously the Germans have a word and a law for it: Erbpacht (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Erbpacht\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Erbpacht</a>)\n\n          Translates as “emphyteusis”, a word I’d never heard of before.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;emphyteusis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;emphyteusis</a>\n\n        Building your mobile home on rented land.\n\n    For Apple specifically it&#x27;s called &quot;Sherlocking&quot;.\n\n      That one is a little different. That&#x27;s when Apple clones your app into their OS as a core feature, thereby completely killing your market.<p>It usually implies Apple deliberately studied your specific app or replicated it based on details revealed in B2B licensing&#x2F;acquisition meetings, similar to what MS pulled with Stacker back in the 90s.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehustle.co&#x2F;sherlocking-explained\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehustle.co&#x2F;sherlocking-explained</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stac_Electronics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stac_Electronics</a>\n\n        Don&#x27;t even have to go back to the 90s, just recently Microsoft pulled that with AppGet.\n\n        Sherlocking is also considered a good thing nowadays. It acts to expand the market by bringing about awareness of such a feature.\n\n          Yeah the built-in way is not as good and featureful as dedicated app&#x27;s but now more people are aware it&#x27;s a thing and get the app.<p>Like sleep cycle app is only rising in popularity even though ios has bedtime now.\n\n    &quot;Sharecropping&quot; is the old name, and it still works fine.\n\n    Tim Bray used sharecropping to describe a similar scenario almost 21 years ago:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;When&#x2F;200x&#x2F;2003&#x2F;07&#x2F;12&#x2F;WebsThePlace\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;When&#x2F;200x&#x2F;2003&#x2F;07&#x2F;12&#x2F;WebsThePla...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;When&#x2F;200x&#x2F;2003&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;ShareCrop2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;When&#x2F;200x&#x2F;2003&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;ShareCrop...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;When&#x2F;200x&#x2F;2008&#x2F;04&#x2F;09&#x2F;Google-Users-API\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tbray.org&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;When&#x2F;200x&#x2F;2008&#x2F;04&#x2F;09&#x2F;Google-Us...</a>\n\n    I&#x27;m a game developer and I&#x27;m _kind_ of interested in building something for Fortnite&#x27;s big third party store, or for Roblox, but its just too risky\n\n  One would think that an company creating cutting edge AI tools, would dog-food that AI biggly. Like, using it for discoverability, here, or having a chat-with-docs system, like groq does. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Though they do use it for prompt generation.<p>I wonder.... The prompt generators can&#x27;t really go wrong. I mean, they can look better or worse, subjectively. But a QnA bot answering questions about docs can be objectively wrong. Is this calculated to improve the optics, and avoid a lot of hallucination complaints?\n\n    It’s concerning that OpenAI doesn’t dog food LLMs for stuff outside of their core business\n\nit is impossible to divorce AI from spam. the two go hand in hand. the spam situation will get far far worse than ever imagined with AI. The web will be increasingly clogged with AI-generated content (e.g.  videos and articles ) that can do a reasonably good job impersonating  human-generated content to the undiscriminating reader. Same for AI-produced research papers, plagiarism, etc. AI-generated content can still be identified, but that is not the point. It has to only be good enough to pass muster for the average person or anyone who is not paying close attention.\n\n  One area that&#x27;s getting close to hitting the mainstream is AI agents that control web browsers or desktop apps. Basically, you tell your AI what you want to do, and it does the computer work for you, showing the results the way you like. You won&#x27;t have to dig through tons of useless apps anymore. It&#x27;ll search, sort, and create feeds for you. This is what scares advertisers the most - when we start saying, &quot;Just talk to my AI.&quot; God knows I&#x27;d love an AI that can fill tax forms for me.<p>Operating on top of UI it is compatible with all devices, kind of like an android robot would fit well with all human spaces and tools. There is plenty of screen capture with narration to learn from. You can generate more training data by essentially giving free reign over a VM to an AI agent. Ask it to do office work. We can also collect this kind of data very easily.\n\n    I recall imagining something s quite like this as a kid when I first encountered the term &quot;User Agent&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d be all in on this if I knew I had full control and explainability of its decisions, but am afraid that reality will be a lot more depressing than what I imagine.\n\n    For a very immediate example, I can already see a clear path to somebody coming up with an LLM service that will automatically filter out political spam texts and emails. (Maybe it already exists and I just haven&#x27;t seen it yet.)\n\n      I am endlessly frustrated every day that this is not a thing yet.  I also don&#x27;t want to send all of my emails to OpenAI though.\n\n        I recently did a Kaggle experiment and finetuned a LLM to classify SMS as SPAM or HAM. It was not so difficult; following the text classification example in the Hugginface transformers docs was enough. Without trying hard at all, accuracy was above 90%. Impressive even though even the messages marked as HAM seemed to be quite trash. The model itself was small - few hundred million parameters only. Models of this size run well on CPUs and an even smaller might have workd too. And non-neural classifiers might also do fine.<p>You could do something similar and unleash it on your mailbox. The tricky part are integrations. At work, I don&#x27;t even bother since interacting with the email system there is way more tricky than with GMail.\n\n        You can configure Postfix to filter content based on a shell script. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postfix.org&#x2F;FILTER_README.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postfix.org&#x2F;FILTER_README.html</a> You can turn the email into plain text from your shell script using links and then ask Mistral if it&#x27;s spam or political: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;oneliners&#x2F;#url\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;oneliners&#x2F;#url</a> You can use the grammar flag to force Mistral to only provide a YES or NO answer, which is easy to check from your script using an IF statement. Then boom, no more spam or politics.\n\n      seems like that would be very straightforward to the point that i could probably do it but maybe not in the most elegant way. I would be surprised if there wasn&#x27;t a model on hugging face trained to identify the political leaning of some text. I bet it would be small enough to run locally, then it&#x27;s a matter of creating a plugin&#x2F;module or something that you add to your email client that runs on every new mail. Based on the result, move the email to your political spam folder.\n\n      LLM is just quite compute-intensive. You could send emails to the OpenAI API to classify them as SPAM or HAM, but you&#x27;d probably cry at the bill. That should explain why it doesn&#x27;t exist in free-tier accounts. Worry not, even in the event you belong to the GPU-poor, a beefy CPU should allow you to run a small LLM on your local machine. And if you find a good dataset for it, you can train the model in a Google Collab.\n\n      On a related note, in 2002, Paul Graham arguably invented (IIRC) the spam filtering that is now commonly in use. While email spam still exists today, it was way, way, way, way worse before Gmail introduced bayesian spam filtering around that time. Today it&#x27;s an occasional amusement. In those last days before spam filtering got a lot better it was reaching the point of seriously making it difficult to use email because the majority of your inbox was spam.<p>The crazy part is it&#x27;s really just this simple bayesian approach that solved like 95% of the problem. Simple math that already existed. Stuff that can be explained to a high schooler. No new crazy ML&#x2F;AI, none of that. Just someone stepping back and pointing out &quot;hey, I think we can use this tool here....&quot;<p>There was a lot more lower hanging fruit in those days.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;spam.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;spam.html</a>\n\n        I remember &quot;A plan for spam&quot;, I implemented the algo myself, and it&#x27;s my first contact with ML.\n\n          You did? At Google?<p>Cool! :)\nAnd thanks! As you can guess I still very pleasantly remember when the feature hit and the spam issue got so much better.<p>I always wonder which pieces of my code from my career I&#x27;m proud of are still running somewhere. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s mostly been proprietary stuff so there&#x27;s really no telling.\n\n    &gt; <i>Basically, you tell your AI what you want to do, and it does the computer work for you, showing the results the way you like. You won&#x27;t have to dig through tons of useless apps anymore. It&#x27;ll search, sort, and create feeds for you. This is what scares advertisers the most</i><p>Not just advertisers. There isn&#x27;t much point in creating any sort of fun content on the web if it never actually gets seen by human eyes, but instead is just regurgitated into a slurry.\n\n      Funny, I like to play a LLM game - copy paste a whole conversation thread into a LLM and ask &quot;Write a 500 word article based on this material&quot;. The result is well grounded enjoyable &quot;regurgitated slurry&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a match made in heaven - people&#x27;s opinions debating stuff and LLMs ability to phrase that like professional written articles. Grounding and style.<p>I&#x27;m afraid in the future not even our social network posts will be directly read by other people. Everything will pass through an AI extractor-reformatter.<p>As an experiment, copy paste a few pages of comments into a LLM and see the quality of its outputs. I often grok a new angle or make a new connection after reading the AI text.<p>Here&#x27;s a sample, what it understood from our thread: &quot;The discussion touches on concerns around AI interfering with traditional content creation, advertising models, and how we discover and consume information online as AI language understanding and generation capabilities advance.&quot; Pretty spot on framing.\n\n        &gt; Here&#x27;s a sample, what it understood from our thread: &quot;The discussion touches on concerns around AI interfering with traditional content creation, advertising models, and how we discover and consume information online as AI language understanding and generation capabilities advance.&quot; Pretty spot on framing.<p>Could you clarify what value, exactly, you&#x27;re finding in that series of words?\n\n        Uh-huh. And what would <i>you</i> have understood from that summary?\n\n    &gt; God knows I&#x27;d love an AI that can fill tax forms for me.<p>Why? A good accountant can do it for an insignificant[1] annual fee, and if he screws up, you know where to find him.<p>Or if you&#x27;re poor enough to really need to save a hundred bucks once a year, you probably qualify for freefile, probably have a really simple tax situation (1 or more W2s, end of story), and can file really quickly.<p>Have you used an e-file program lately? It, much like a human accountant, asks a bunch of questions. Not sure what an AI could do differently, except fuck up and ask the wrong questions confidently once in a while.<p>The US has some screwed up tax filing practices but throwing more magic at them would only make it worse. If AI does my taxes, who do I get mad at when it files it wrong and the IRS comes after me? Why are we even talking about AI to apply to a problem that really isn&#x27;t particularly messy and is already easily solved by good data import and by a nest of ifs and elses maintained once a year by a team of programmers who can read tax laws?<p>Like, we could make tax filing unnecessary tomorrow for most people with no AI, just by passing a law that allows the IRS to use the imported W2 data they <i>already</i> receive to compute and file default tax returns for most people who have simple tax situations.\n\nA tool to generate spam content becomes plagued by it. Seems predictable.\n\n  LLMs are no more a tool to generate spam than text and image editors or programming languages are.\n\n    Almost immediately after OpenAI opened its API there were a raft of services to send auto-generated sales and marketing emails. Sure, there are other ways to generate unsolicited commercial emails. There are even services that will spam on your behalf. But, there&#x27;s obviously a huge difference between an empty text editor and a service that generates plausibly phrased emails with virtually no effort.\n\n      Similarly, the worst kind of SEO grifters are now providing services which can mass-generate thousands of longform &quot;articles&quot; on your behalf based on nothing but a handful of keywords, or even scrape a competitors site and bulk generate articles based on their content. SEO spam isn&#x27;t new but automating it on this level is unprecedented.\n\n        The danger is that we rely almost entirely on Google to solve this.<p>The monopoly they have as a search engine means there is effectively sole responsibility on them to maintain a usable internet.<p>I genuinely feel sorry for the people that now have to figure out how search  engines work in a world where anybody can generate reams of passable (albeit not unique) content in minutes.\n\n          While the Google Search people are scrambling to figure out how to sift through genAI slop, another team on the other side of the Google campus is building a platform for publishers to generate that slop. By joining the AI arms race they&#x27;ve put themselves in the awkward position of contributing to the problem that&#x27;s killing their own core product.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adweek.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;google-paying-publishers-unreleased-gen-ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adweek.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;google-paying-publishers-unrele...</a>\n\n            Yup I saw the Google official YouTube channel comment on a seo channel saying these are good tips and the tips were basically let AI generate a bunch of content for you.<p>Google is out of ideas and they are lost as a company. They will take a long time to die out but die out they will.\n\n        A recent example of this was &quot;theresawikiforthat&quot;, which generated sites like ocamlwiki.com and juliawiki.com that were full of very low-quality information. They are offline now, but the ocamlwiki was consistently toward the top of google search results for a while last year.<p>Here are some threads from the ocaml&#x2F;julia communities as they started to catch on: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.ocaml.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-up-with-ocamlwiki&#x2F;13605\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.ocaml.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-up-with-ocamlwiki&#x2F;13605</a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.julialang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-the-juliawiki&#x2F;109335\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.julialang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-the-juliawiki&#x2F;109335</a>\n\n          I would like to write a bot for these kinds of websites, but subvert the whole thing, have no ads, no waffle, high quality info. Get to the point as fast as possible.\n\n        I got a few hundred words into a product review the other day before I encountered &quot;as of my knowledge cut off...&quot;<p>Shame on me for not noticing earlier, but I did expect a review site listed on page 1 of google to host actual reviews\n\n      Yes, historically people abuse tools for spam. And also golergka is still completely correct.\n\n      You speak of this like its something that is behind us.<p>lol, thats funny.\n\n    Similarly, the Haber–Bosch process is no more a tool to produce crop fertilizer than feeding corn to a cow is.<p>Seriously though - the ability to industrialize and mass-produce that both LLMs and the industrial ammonia process have given us, for the bad and the good, is the real game-changer here. Treating two tools the same because both can give you the same singular result is an error if they have dramatically different - by several orders of magniture - speeds at which these results are achieved.\n\n    Like all automation tools, LLMs are very effective at <i>getting more done</i>.<p>They&#x27;re not content-neutral (no violence, no sex, etc., which some people complain about <i>very loudly</i>), but for anything not forbidden, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 can output more for about $4233.60 than a human record holding stenographer can type <i>in a working lifetime</i>.<p>When it doesn&#x27;t have to be amazing, and I think spam is one of many things in that category, this is absolutely a huge deal compared to a text editor.\n\n      &gt; gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 can output more for about $4233.60 than a human record holding stenographer can type in a working lifetime.<p>“This is the same picture”<p>1. Build your entire professional ethos on automating things<p>2. Claim that automation doesn’t make any difference<p>If it’s not named already, I’d coin it “the hacker blindspot”: Scale is simultaneously paramount and irrelevant.\n\n    Bombs are no more a tool to kill people than rocks or knives are.\n\n      Are you claiming that overwhelming majority of bombs are used to cook and build? Please do share these intriguing cuisine and masonry techniques!\n\n        I think the majority of explosives are used for fireworks and mining, but I honestly have no idea how to get an accurate count of explosives set off in mining vs. explosives set off in warfare.\n\n          I&#x27;m pretty sure that majority of explosives by equivalent TNT or by dollar value are used in nuclear warheads for strategic deterrence, and thankfully have never been set off. But it would an interesting challenge to estimate all of these indeed.\n\n            I think you’ll appreciate the origins of the Nobel Prize.<p>Alfred Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers.[11] He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth coming from his 355 inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.[12]<p>There is a popular story about how, in 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled &quot;The Merchant of Death Is Dead&quot;, in a French newspaper. It was Alfred&#x27;s brother Ludvig who had died; the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will.[13] Historians have been unable to verify this story and some dismiss the story as a myth.[14][15] On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.[16]<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nobel_Prize\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nobel_Prize</a>\n\n        He wasn&#x27;t claiming that, he was just applying your stupid logic elsewhere.\n\n        No. If the point hasn’t already landed elaboration is futile.\n\n    Have you ever found this quote?<p>&gt; <i>These findings, combined with earlier results on synthetic imagery, audio, and video, imply that technologies are reducing the cost of generating fake content and waging disinformation campaigns.</i><p>That paragraph comes from this [1] now-deleted blog post from OpenAI in 2019 when they decided not to release GPT-2 due to &quot;concerns about malicious applications of the technology&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to argue that GPT and friends are not &quot;tools to generate spam&quot; when the researchers themselves argued that point years ago.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190214171619&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.openai.com&#x2F;better-language-models&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190214171619&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.opena...</a>\n\n    Yes, they ARE more a tool to generate spam than text, because they can do everything a single text does, but in addition it can also generate text. So strictly more spam.\n\n    C&#x27;mon, be serious. It isn&#x27;t the only thing they&#x27;re good at, but they are very good at generating spam.<p>I would even argue that it&#x27;s what they&#x27;re <i>best</i> at, because it&#x27;s the one application where the tendency to confabulate is irrelevant to the use case.\n\n    And a chainsaw is just tool to cut things like a plastic knife.\n\n  &gt; Seems Predictable<p>Nice pun\n\n  it is good to hear they dogfood their products so heavily\n\nIt was a huge mistake to monetize GPTs. I and many other AI enthusiasts would have probably developed plenty of useful GPTs for free. But now I would never bother because nobody will see my projects under all the SEO spam and fake ratings.\n\n  When you say it&#x27;s monetized, are they actually giving anyone any money? The details of that were to &quot;to be announced&quot; but I haven&#x27;t heard any announcement.\n\n    It seems that just the &#x27;threat&#x27; of monetizing it would cause an absolute flood of GPTs to be launched, under the assumption that they would eventually get paid.\n\n  Have to disagree. When OpenAI didn&#x27;t provide a method of revenue for plugins they were plagued with third-party paywall services\n\n    Plug-ins are a bit different because someone needed to host a backend for it. Most GPTs are fully hosted by OpenAI.\n\n  It&#x27;s the fastest growth product in number of users in the history of the internet, to think they wouldn&#x27;t run the Apple store playbook as much as possible is naive.\n\n  That and even if they had proper reviews in place, there is no telling when they would pull the plug on the entire thing. Based on that alone I never even considered making a GPT for sale.<p>Having said that, I do like them because of the openAPI integration. I made one for myself that can send things to a private discord channel through webhooks and can calls my memo instance (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;usememo\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;usememo</a>) to store or retrieve memos.\n\nWhen the barrier to entry is non-existent, this outcome is inevitable.\n\nOpenAI GPTs Store was supposed to be the &quot;iPhone moment&quot; which it changes everything and upends the App Store. ...Or so I was told by the AI bros.<p>So what <i>really</i> happened? Most likely little quality control, garbage copy cats running around and now there is an insurmountable amount of spam.<p>That is nothing like the quality of the Apple App Store.\n\n  &gt; So what really happened? Most likely little quality control, garbage copy cats running around and now there is an insurmountable amount of spam.<p>That, and there isn&#x27;t a lot of space for real innovation within the &quot;GPT&quot; framework that OpenAI provides. Most of what&#x27;s available in their store is literally just prepackaged prompts, and there&#x27;s only so much that can accomplish. You can ask a chatbot to pretend to be an expert in a topic all day, but that won&#x27;t actually make it into one.<p>If Apple&#x27;s App Store were just a form you filled out to release versions of Flappy Bird with new graphics or whatever, that&#x27;d fail too. Developers need conceptual &quot;space&quot; to innovate; I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s possible when the interface (a chat window) and the back end (a language model) are both set in stone by the platform.\n\n  It was doomed from the start, because monetizable computing platforms that target consumers can&#x27;t succeed if they don&#x27;t have high barriers to entry.<p>Low quality Atari games were responsible for the 1983 video game crash. Anyone could publish an Atari game. So what ended up happening was people made games about things like raping Native American women (Custer&#x27;s Revenge) and they were sold just like any other Atari cartridge.<p>Nintendo pioneered the closed platform. No one was allowed to build games for Nintendo without Nintendo&#x27;s permission. Microsoft and Apple did things a bit differently, by making their platforms as difficult to develop for as possible. WIN32 is byzantine. Making iPhone apps when the App Store was launched required learning Objective C, which was an entirely new language to most developers at the time.<p>OpenAI on the other hand created an app store which, in their own words, &quot;is simple and doesn&#x27;t require any coding skills.&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-the-gpt-store\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-the-gpt-store</a>\n\n    Yep. And watch “no code &#x2F; low code” movement do the same for SaaS\n\n    Every GPT I&#x27;ve tried has been GPT-4 plus or minus an imperceptible difference in quality. It&#x27;s like Atari publishing a game, and thousands of clones show up that are functionally the same, and zero other original games.<p>They should scrap this failed idea and just give us MedQA, AlphaCode, etc. Specialized GPTs based on custom RAG or symbolic reasoning overlay or whatever, that actually do <i>something</i> that base GPT-4 can&#x27;t do, in the sense of having an unmistakable step-change in quality for one type of task.\n\n  I think it has a fundamentally different problem. Any GPT I have tried, I could just ask chatGPT4 the same thing so I haven&#x27;t bothered exploring much.<p>I am still waiting to hear of a GPT that is obviously better than chatGPT4 by itself. Maybe it exists but I haven&#x27;t heard of it.<p>Short of GPT5 powered GPTs while I can only still talk directly to GPT4, I don&#x27;t think I am going to be that impressed with anything using the chatGPT API compared to just asking chatGPT4 directly or using the API for my own needs. I don&#x27;t need an interface for what I want to do with the API. ChatGPT4 can help me write that myself quite easily. I think the future looks much more like this than some app store knockoff.\n\nThe use case for AI is spam.\n\n  “The purpose of a system is what it does.”\n\n    By the same logic, the purpose [0] of “the purpose of a system is what it does” is thought-terminating cliché.<p>[0] in most short comments in online discussions, at least.\n\nAs I had written about publicly already, this doesn&#x27;t surprise me a bit. Same with poe.com, GPTs can be generated in just a few clicks by anyone anywhere with no quality control in sight.<p>My guess is that it was always a play about having access to high-quality data.\n\nA spam-filled online marketplace is almost becoming a feature. That way the top developers have to pay and outbid each other to get featured and show up in search results, and that becomes a lucrative revenue source for the platform.\n\n  Bingo. It’s the “platform-corporation” playbook only at 10x the speed.<p>“Tired of drowning in the totally unpreventable noise of spammers? Well, have you tried our Boost product?”\n\nCan anyone recommend a good chatgpt chatbot from the store? I havent had a poll recently. Any suggestions would be great, thanks.\n\n&gt; OpenAI’s terms explicitly prohibit developers from building GPTs that promote academic dishonesty. Yet the GPT Store is filled with GPTs suggesting they can bypass AI content detectors, including detectors sold to educators through plagiarism scanning platforms.<p>The use of generative AI in academic contexts--both education and research--is turning out to be a vast ethical gray area. It seems that some people regard any use of AI for writing under one&#x27;s own name to be dishonest. Others are willing to allow some AI use, but where they draw the line varies a lot. Is it okay, for example, to have an LLM correct word-level grammatical mistakes, rewrite a paragraph to make the author&#x27;s point clearer, write a paragraph based on the author&#x27;s bullet points, write a full first draft that the author then checks and revises by hand, translate phrases or sentences that the author has written in their native language, translate an entire paragraph or paper that the author wrote, etc.?<p>Over the past year, I have conducted several workshops on LLMs for university faculty in Japan, and when I have polled them about the acceptability of each of those use cases, their responses have varied widely.<p>At the institutional level, some universities discourage their students from using AI for writing at all, while others seem to be encouraging it. Just last week, I heard about two public universities in Japan that have contracted with Microsoft to provide Copilot to all of their students starting in April, when the new academic year begins here.\n\n  What’s more unethical than the bypassers is the so called detectors whose claims are dubious.\n\n  example -- &quot;UC Berkeley Law School AI Policy&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;transactional&#x2F;u-california-berkeley-law-school-rolls-out-ai-policy-ahead-final-exams-2023-04-20&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;transactional&#x2F;u-california-ber...</a>\n\nShouldn&#x27;t OpenAI be able to easily remove these non-complying GPTs by putting up their own GPT for moderation with a set of rules?<p>They should already have something in place. And if they have, and these GPTs are still up it can also mean these are OK as per their policy. Ot may be they are deliberately not moderating these because money.\n\nReminds me of an early rumor back when Sam Altman was fired (and briefly re-hired) that the old board allegedly was very much against the GPT store.<p>I kind of get why now.  It arguably doesn&#x27;t really aid in the non-profit&#x27;s mission to pursue AGI, or share the benefits of AI with humanity, or any of that stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t even seem to be much of a worthwhile endeavor from a purely money-making perspective either.\n\n  But it does keep users in OpenAI ecosystem vs. the competition.\n\n    Yeah, but does it matter?  Most of their revenue comes from enterprise clients and it seems more likely that someone is going to create a killer app for AI by leveraging APIs and publishing their work on traditional distribution channels rather than creating something that only works on a relatively niche platform.<p>Like, hypothetically, if Anthropic took the lead in this effort, I don&#x27;t think it would derail OpenAI&#x27;s plans in the slightest.\n\n      Users on the platform provide training data that can be used to improve the platform which attracts more users in a classic snowball&#x2F;flywheel effect.\n\nThe Apple App Store (and Google Play Store) have a fairly large barrier to entry. To develop an app, you needed to actually code one. Learning objective C, Swift or  Java isn&#x27;t easy and therefore you had to have some skill to gain entry. With the GPT store, anyone that could type out some instructions could build a GPT and submit it. There was 0 barrier to entry and the flood of spam was a foregone conclusion. They should have either vetted the GPTs, invited select developers, or charged a large developer fee to be included to increase the quality and reduce the spam.\n\n  And you have to pay and there&#x27;s a review process, and basically anyone who has released apps has had their submission rejected, the reviewers generously deny.\n\nI use GPTs like bookmarks. If I find an interesting or useful prompt, I bookmark &#x2F; GPT it, maybe add a tool, later, and sometimes I share it, too. For me, Custom GPT is just a flashy term for bookmark and the GPT Store is just a social bookmark site."

      "conversation_text": "Very cool! I don&#x27;t have this pain point currently but I can absolutely see the utility. I like the in built demo tool (although it sadly means you have no need for DemoTime lol).<p>The demo.camelqa needs some styling. I would invest a few minutes here. Maybe a loading spinner too if you&#x27;re expecting 15second latency.<p>Technically is this doing clever things with markup, or literally just feeding the image into a multimodal LLM and getting function calls in response?\n\n  Thanks for the feedback! We&#x27;ll add some styling to the demo page. We&#x27;re processing the image with an object detection model and classification model and also using some accessibility element data to get a better understanding of what is interactive on the screen.\n\n    Why don&#x27;t you also use GPT4-V for that part?\n\n      GPT-4V is great for reasoning about what is on the screen. However, it struggles with precision. For example, it is not able to specify the coordinates to tap when it decides to tap an icon. That&#x27;s where the object detection and accessibility elements help. We can precisely locate interactive elements.\n\n        Have you tried putting a pixel grid over the image with labelled guidelines every 100px?<p>Was one thing I never got around to testing with DemoTime but was always curious about.<p>Anyway sorry this is a nice product. Congratulations on the launch.<p>Always good to see substantial tech\n\n          Thanks! Yes, we experimented with that! I think because of the way that GPT sees images in patches it has a hard time with absolute positioning but that&#x27;s just a guess.\n\n            I&#x27;ve done something similar and found the same thing. It also could not calibrate when I drew a dot on its last suggested coordinates.<p>&quot;You said the play button was at 100, 200 and a green circle is drawn there. Is the circle located on the button or do you need to adjust it&quot;<p>Something along those lines. And it also got the size of the image.<p>Nope its in the right ballpark but it could not make fine adjustments or anything closer to a button.\n\nAs someone who worked in a mobile dev team, I can only applaud your effort! :)<p>I have a few questions:<p>As with all new AI-based RPA &amp; Testing frameworks (there are quite many in YC), I&#x27;m curious about the costs and performance. Let&#x27;s say I want to run a few smoke tests (5-10 end-to-end scenarios) on my app across multiple iOS and Android devices with different screen sizes and OS versions before going into production.<p>What would it cost, and how long would it take to complete the tests?<p>Do you already have customers running such real-world use cases with it?\n\n  Good questions. Execution cost is indeed higher than traditional testing automation scripts but much lower than the human cost of writing and maintaining the scripts. We&#x27;re starting at $500&#x2F;month and our plans go up from there depending on how many devices you want to test across. We do have customers running across multiple devices and OS versions today.\n\nGreat demo ! This is going to be a huge time &#x2F; money saving for companies.\n\nHaving worked on mobile infra for many years now for a couple very large iOS teams, excited to learn more and kudos for putting yourselves out there.\n1. Integration tests are notoriously slow, the demo seemed to take some time to do basic actions; is it even possible to run these at scale?\n2. &gt;Flaky UI tests suck; they can be flaky but it&#x27;s often due to bad code and architecture. Any data to backup your tool makes the tests less flaky? I could see a scenario where there are 2 buttons with the same text, but under the hood we&#x27;d use different identifiers in-code to determine which button should be tapped in UI.<p>Overall I&#x27;m a bit skeptical because most UI tests are pretty easy to write today with very natural DSLs that are close to natural language, but definitely want to follow and hear more production use cases.\n\n  Great questions.\n1. Yes, running tests in parallel helps. We also cache actions so subsequent runs are much faster (this is disabled in the demo).\n2. I agree that testing can be much more reliable and pleasant in some codebases than others. I have not been blessed with these types of codebases in my career. Flakiness is from personal experience automating UI tests specifically and having them break when a new nondeterministic popup modal is added or another engineer breaks an identifier&#x2F;locator strategy.\nThat being said, if you like writing UI tests and your codebase supports easily maintaining them, there are some really cool DSLs like Maestro!\n\n    &gt; We also cache actions so subsequent runs are much faster<p>Interesting, what do you cache? How do you know if 1 change needs to be rerun versus another?<p>&gt;Flakiness is from personal experience automating UI tests specifically and having them break when a new nondeterministic popup modal is added or another engineer breaks an identifier&#x2F;locator strategy<p>A modal popping up isn&#x27;t a flake though, it&#x27;s often when a button is on screen but the test runner can&#x27;t seem to find it due to run-loop issues or emulator&#x2F;simulator issues. If a modal pops up on the screen in a test, how does CamelQA resolve this and how would it know if it&#x27;s an actual regression or not? If a modal pops up on a screen at the wrong time that _could_ be a real regression, versus a developer forgetting to configure some local state.\n\n      1. The AI agent writes an automation script (similar to Appium) that we can replay after the first successful run. If there are issues the AI agent gets pulled back into the loop.<p>2. You can define acceptance criteria in natural language with camel.\n\n  &gt; most UI tests are pretty easy to write today with very natural DSLs that are close to natural language<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be a better&#x2F;cheaper&#x2F;faster solution to use LLMs to write UI&#x2F;integration tests?\n\n    The issue with this approach is that for all but the most simple apps it is not possible to deduce the runtime element information needed to write traditional UI tests given just the source code. This can only be done reliably at runtime which is what we do. We run your app and iteratively build UI tests that can be reused later.\n\nYour demo is very concise and well crafted. Is your host naturally smooth or it was many takes? Good job\n\n  Our host is naturally smooth. We&#x27;ve tried a few different platforms to host this demo and landed on mac stadium. Glad you enjoyed your experience.\n\nAny support for non-mobile native apps? e.g. macOS?\n\n  Not yet but it&#x27;s on the road map! We have a monthly newsletter if you&#x27;d like to stay up to date\n\n    Will do, and good luck with getting some traction! I am bullish on automation like this, and loved the demo.\n\nAppium project starter here. Congrats on the launch! If you ever want to talk shop, let me know!<p>I&#x27;m glad to see more vision-first, AI-powered testing tools in the world.\n\n  We&#x27;d love to! What&#x27;s the best way for us to get in touch?\n\n    Contact info should be visible in my bio here. Otherwise, a DM on Twitter works, too. (@hugs)\n\n  Wow thanks! We&#x27;re only able to build this because of tools like Appium. Thanks for all of your contributions to this space.\n\n  Props for everything you do Jason and share openly, also your robots!\n\nThis looks awesome, automated UI testing is so hard to get right but also very important. Great work so far!\n\n  Thank you! It is hard to get right. And what we&#x27;ve noticed from the user&#x27;s we&#x27;ve been talking to, no one company has won in this space just yet.\n\n    &gt; no one company has won in this space just yet<p>Detox from Wix for React Native Apps is pretty good.\n\nI LOVE this. I pitched something similar (albeit far less intelligent) to my last employer only to get scoffed at, so it makes me really happy to see someone actually make and productize it. Wishing you success!\n\n  Scoffed at! Aw that sucks. Well when we blow up I hope you get your rightfully deserved &quot;I told you so&quot; moment. Thanks for the support :)\n\nDemo looks very slick.<p>How far off being able to integrate into a CICD pipe is this? I&#x27;d love if this could trigger off a pr, then block merging since it wasn&#x27;t sure how to execute some regular user flow (even if that were due to it not understanding how it could perform an action, since this maybe means my flow doesn&#x27;t make sense).\n\n  Thanks! We are releasing an API soon along with some common CI&#x2F;CD pipeline integrations. We&#x27;re working hard on speeding tests up so that we don&#x27;t slow down your pipeline.\n\nThis is a great idea. I assume that inference costs will be higher for the time being, but it does aim to solve a real problem. Kudos..!\n\n  Thanks! Yes inference costs are non-negligible right now but we think this will come down over time\n\nYeah, the two big issues with UI tests: flaky and slow.<p>Curious how using GPT and vision combats flakiness? I&#x27;d feel the entropy of GPT and anything less than 100% accuracy in the computer vision pieces would lead to more flakiness.<p>I also wonder about the speed and costs of running the tests. When E2E tests are traditionally slow and expensive already. The computer vision and GPT elements seem costlier and less fast.\n\n  We use GPT 4V to reason about the screen and decide what to do next. It does make mistakes. Here&#x27;s a video of it thinking a page in the shop app is an ad (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MKyO-U7j4Hs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MKyO-U7j4Hs</a>).<p>The upside is that we do prompt hacking on our end to break out of loops and heal after it&#x27;s made a mistake. Having said that, we&#x27;re working on improving this!<p>On costs, it&#x27;s cheaper than you think. The entire playground demo cost us less than $10. More expensive than running a script but we believe the cost of intelligence will go down in time.<p>On speed, yes it is slow. We minimize this by parallelizing tests across devices on our device farm. We can normally turn results around in 2.5-4 hours depending on the number of tests.<p>Thanks for the questions!\n\nwould be nice to just invite the AI tester to TestFlight instead of uploading the build :)\n\n  noted:) thanks for the feedback I think that would be an easier way to kick off camelQA as well. We&#x27;ll have to learn how to do that in our remote physical device farm.\n\nThis is very cool. Is there a version for browsers?\n\n  Thanks. It&#x27;s on our roadmap, but we&#x27;re starting with mobile first.\n\nSeems similar to App Quality Copilot - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobile.dev&#x2F;app-quality-copilot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobile.dev&#x2F;app-quality-copilot</a>\n\n  They&#x27;re building something based on appium and specifically through Maestro which is an excellent use of appium. But it isn&#x27;t AI - we&#x27;re excited to try it out!\n\n    Maestro is not based on Appium. It&#x27;s built from the ground up, you can learn more about its internals here[0].<p>&gt; it isn&#x27;t AI<p>Hmm, why? I understand &quot;AI&quot; is an incredibly broad term, and there are maybe some fundamental differences between how App Quality Copilot and CamelQA work (I tried neither), but from looking at App Quality Copilot&#x27;s website, it sure looks like &quot;AI&quot;.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mobile.dev&#x2F;maestro-re-building-the-ios-driver-603998b012e8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mobile.dev&#x2F;maestro-re-building-the-ios-driver-6...</a>\n\nCongrats, very exciting. Do you support configuring things like usernames and passwords? How do you handle MFA?\n\n  Yes and yes. Check out the sole GIF we&#x27;ve provided. It should show you an example of camelQA navigating user sign up MFA by navigating to the email app through a deep link, verifying the email, navigating back to the app and confirming sign up.\n\nI love this idea. Is there something similar for web-apps?<p>I wonder if you can easily add AI-based fuzzing or AI-based sample workflows to a testing pipeline.\n\n  Thanks! Web app support is coming very soon. That would be a really cool application of the API\n\n    I&#x27;d love to give an AI a list of workflows to try out every time I push an update to my site.<p>In addition to pass&#x2F;fail, I can see it even leaving some comments about ease-of-use. There&#x27;s a lot of value here!\n\nWhy is the branding&#x2F;mascot a camel?<p>I&#x27;m reminded of Waldo, a mobile testing automation product that was acquired in 2023.<p>Their mascot is another camelid (not sure if alpaca or llama). <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waldo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waldo.com&#x2F;</a>\n\n  We originally spelled it qaml which stood for quality assurance, machine learning. That wasn&#x27;t obvious to anyone and everyone would pronounce it as &quot;qwamel&quot; which we hated so we decided on camelQA instead. Thanks for the question. I was waiting for someone to ask it!\n\n    I noticed the first letter in camelQA is very explicitly lower-case. I just assumed someone on the team had very strong opinions about camelCase.\n\nThis is excellent. Definitely useful and well communicated on your site. Curious where you want to expand it, seems like it can be used to track not just your own apps but the apps of others and track information and new UX from competitors as well (I&#x27;ve seen apps like ChangeTower for the web).  Is this the direction you&#x27;re planning to take this? More initial thoughts here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FrLNG2vtxsA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FrLNG2vtxsA</a>\n\n  Goated guild, wait can we called you GG? GG your youtube videos are dope thank you for commenting. I&#x27;ll leave that answer to our CEO - we have a lot of different paths we&#x27;re considering today. Many people are interested in using camel&#x27;s agent to operate an iphone or android using natural language. But after we master test execution for mobile and test case creation we&#x27;re moving on to web.<p>Tracking competitive apps would be an interesting use case for automation. One of our partners at YC asked up to use camel to automatically refresh the waitlist for a tesla cyber truck lol."

This was a regular Google team.\n\n    Maybe they meant revenue free?\n\n    In the US, R&amp;D expenses can often be deducted when filing taxes. I’m sure large companies like Google would be taking advantage of those rules.\n\n      Can&#x27;t all expenses be deducted when filing taxes? I mean, taxes are paid on profit, which is revenue minus expenses.\n\n        Yeah the person you are replying to was imprecise - there&#x27;s actually tax <i>credits</i> for R&amp;D expense in the US rather than just tax deductions.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plantemoran.com&#x2F;explore-our-thinking&#x2F;insight&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;is-your-business-getting-the-rd-tax-credit-it-deserves\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plantemoran.com&#x2F;explore-our-thinking&#x2F;insight&#x2F;202...</a>\n\n          Starting this year you need to amortize the R&amp;D expenses over 5+ years, which is going to be brutal for startups.<p>Losing a lot of money and you can&#x27;t write off your engineers\n\n        Not to mention the thing about tax credits, but when people say &quot;R&amp;D expenses&quot; they often include quite a lot of investments on their definition.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s arguable if anything in R&amp;D qualifies as an expense at all.\n\n          Only money spent that turns into an asset is investment. I’m not sure how it is in US, but in Germany, for example, not even registering a patent is an investment and does not imply the creation of an asset — only buying the patent creates the asset.\n\n    What they meant was that the R&amp;D was fully deductible, not amortized over a number of years. It&#x27;s like saying that a business&#x27;s electricity bill is &quot;tax-free&quot; because they can deduct it from their revenues immediately.<p>And as it is, Google certainly paid property taxes immediately on the office building as well as FICA on all of the employees who, of course, paid their own taxes.<p>But haters of the R&amp;D system love to call it &quot;tax-free&quot;.\n\n      There&#x27;s the benefit of expensing the costs over amortizating them - but there&#x27;s also straight up cash in the form of R&amp;D tax credits - it&#x27;s one method tech companies use to minimize their tax bills:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plantemoran.com&#x2F;explore-our-thinking&#x2F;insight&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;is-your-business-getting-the-rd-tax-credit-it-deserves\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plantemoran.com&#x2F;explore-our-thinking&#x2F;insight&#x2F;202...</a>\n\n  Many inventions of the modern age were largely R&amp;D bloat as you&#x27;d describe it - in this age R&amp;D is done in university, spun out into a startup, and dies shortly after the IPO - but there&#x27;s a flicker of it occasionally lasting on if it can hide under the guise of a tax deduction.\n\n  Weren&#x27;t transistors specifically invented to improve telephone networks?\n\n  I mean this is how the US operates. Other countries continually try to refine their existing industries and societal structures. In the US, you let everything rot and hope that a hail Mary innovation comes out of somewhere and creates a breath of fresh air. It creates quite a wild society, but it seems to have worked for now!\n\n  That would make sense, if companies and executives paid their damn taxes in the first place.\n\nOf note:<p>“ Six of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively.”\n\n  Why would that be of note, especially in America? I think it would be an interesting observation in China or Japan, or some other country which is generally less welcoming to immigrants than the US\n\n    First generation immigrants are still a tiny minority of the population. The fact that the entire team consists effectively of first generation immigrants says something, probably both about higher education and American culture.\n\n      &gt; First generation immigrants are still a tiny minority of the population<p>Not in California. Last I remember, something like a quarter of the state’s population is foreign born.\n\n        It looks like you are roughly right, but still, a sampling of 8 students from this population is not likely to come up that way (by my calculation 1.4x10^-7)<p>&gt; All Students in Higher Education in California<p>&gt; 2,737,000<p>&gt; First-Generation Immigrant Students<p>&gt; 387,000<p>14% are first-generation immigrants<p>from: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.higheredimmigrationportal.org&#x2F;state&#x2F;california&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.higheredimmigrationportal.org&#x2F;state&#x2F;california&#x2F;</a>\n\n        That&#x27;s still a 1-in-4^8 = 1-in-65536 longshot.\n\n          Its really not; hiring within a single firm, especially for related functions, will tend fo have correlated biases, rather than being a random sample from even the pool of qualified applicants, much less the broader population.\n\n      &gt; First generation immigrants are still a tiny minority of the population.<p>About 1&#x2F;8 of the US population is foreign-born, which is a minority but not a tiny one. In California, its over a quarter.\n\n      Isn&#x27;t some of it have to do with it being a self selecting sample? If you come to America to study, you were a good student in your resident country leading to more chances of success than the average local citizen. Their children might be smarter on average.\nAlternatively if you are coming fleeing persecutions you are enterprising enough to set up something for your children. That hard work inculcates a sort of work ethic in such children which in turn sets them up for success.\nSpeaking from experience as an immigrant myself.\n\n        I think all those are true, but if so the percentages of first-generation immigrants should increase as you ascend the educational pyramid. I believe it does from\nundergrad to Phd, but not from general population to higher education, so clearly there are at least two very different worlds.<p>There is a motivation that comes with both trying to make it and being cognizant of the relative opportunity that is absent in the second-generation and beyond.<p>There are also many advantages given to students outside the majority. When those advantages land not on the disadvantaged but on the advantaged-but-foreign, are they accomplishing their objectives? How bad would higher education have been in Europe? What is the objective, actually?\n\n      I think you have completely the wrong takeaway here...<p>The US population is around 330 million. The world population is 8.1 billion people. What is that 4%? If you took a random sampling of people around the world, none of them would be Americans. You&#x27;re going to need a lot more samples to find a trend.<p>Yet when you turn around and look at success stories, a huge portion of this is going to occur in the US for multiple reasons, especially for the ability to attract intelligence from other parts of the globe and make it wealthy here.\n\n        I understand, but reality has to factor in — to get representative you would have to narrow your sample to English-speaking, narrow it to legal for long-term employment in the US, narrow it to having received at least an American-level higher education…\n\n      One thing is that getting a PhD is a good way to get into the U.S.  As a foreigner, many visa and job opportunities open up to you with the PhD.<p>For an American, it&#x27;s less of a good deal.  Once you have the PhD, you make somewhat more money, but you&#x27;re trading that for 6 years of hard work and very low pay.  The numbers aren&#x27;t favorable -- you have to love the topic for it to make any sense.<p>As a result, U.S. PhD programs are heavily foreign born.\n\n        A PHD is a faster path to a green card as well - especially for people born in China and India where the green card backlog is decades long.\n\n    The US is still the place to be, despite its problems…\n\n    Because there are plenty of people in the US who are neither immigrants nor the children of immigrants.  In fact, they&#x27;re probably a significant majority.  So to have 8 out of 8 be members of the smaller set is rather unlikely.\n\n      Not when you consider that those people were pulled from a worldwide talent pool for a relatively niche topic. If you can recruit anyone you want in the world and end up with 8&#x2F;8 Americans, <i>that</i> would be weird.\n\n    &gt; less welcoming to immigrants than the US<p>Not sure if we can claim this any more, what with texas shipping busloads of immigrants to NY and the mayor declaring it a citywide emergency, and both major parties rushing to get a border wall built.\n\n      Conflating illegal and legal immigration is not a useful contribution to this conversation.\n\n        The phrasing was &quot;welcoming to immigrants&quot;, not &quot;welcoming to the ever shrinking definition of good immigrants established by a bunch of octogenarian plutocrats&quot;.<p>&quot;Illegal&quot; is a concept - it&#x27;s not conflating to assume that it&#x27;s not the bedrock of the way people think.\n\n          &gt; &quot;Illegal&quot; is a concept<p>Illegal immigrant is pretty well defined, an immigrant that didn&#x27;t come through the legal means. The people hired by Google are probably not illegal immigrants.\n\n          Illegal is a status more than it is a concept. Immigrating illegally is not the central definition of immigration, any more than shoplifting is the central definition of customer.<p>America is much more welcoming of immigration, by which I mean <i>legal</i> immigration, than Japan or China. This is not in dispute.<p>It is also, in practice, quite a bit more slack about <i>illegal</i> immigration than either of those countries. Although I hope that changes.\n\n            &gt;America is much more welcoming of immigration, by which I mean legal immigration, than Japan or China. This is not in dispute.<p>It&#x27;s not?  It sounds like you know little about the world outside of America.  Japan is stupidly easy to immigrate to: just get a job offer here at a place that sponsors your visa and it&#x27;s pretty trivial to immigrate.  Even better, if you have enough points, you can apply for permanent residence after 1 or 3 years, and the cost is trivial.  In America, getting a Green Card is very difficult and costly, and depending on your national origin can be almost impossible.  In Japan, there&#x27;s no limits at all, per year or per country of origin, for work visas or PR.  Of course, Japan is somewhat selective about who it wants to immigrate, but America is no different there, which is why there&#x27;s such a huge debate about illegal immigration (in America it&#x27;s not that hard; in an island country it&#x27;s not so easy).\n\n    With the current state of Visas for the US, most countries are now more welcoming to migrants.\n\n  Yes, this is one of the actually admirable qualities of the US and California in particular. CA has one of the world’s largest economies because it attracts and embraces people from just about every part of the world.\n\n  The more interesting thing to me is that only one of them went to an elite American undergrad (Duke). Rest went to undergrads in India, Ukraine, Germany, Canada (UToronto has a 43% acceptance rate).\n\nLooking forward to the inevitable movie about how they invented it and the company failed to productize it because of it&#x27;s culture and management\n\n  Xerox 2: Electric Boogoogle\n\n  Same thing is happening with the Figure One robot. There isn&#x27;t much new in the demo Figure did recently, all the work has been published in the palm saycan paper and other deepmind papers. Google is good at laying golden eggs and not realizing that they&#x27;ve laid them. Then employees get fed up, leave and start their own companies so they can productize their work without management getting in the way.\n\n  This is a story that could be written over and over again. Companies with big R&amp;D budgets but not nimble enough any more to take advantage.\n\n&gt; &quot;Realistically, we could have had GPT-3 or even 3.5 probably in 2019, maybe 2020. The big question isn’t, did they see it? The question is, why didn’t we do anything with the fact that we had seen it? The answer is tricky.”<p>The answer is that monopolies stifle technological innovation because one well-established part of their business (advertising-centric search) would be negatively impacted by an upstart branch (chatbots) that would cut into search ad revenue.<p>This is comparable to a investor-owned consortium of electric utilities, gas-fired power plants, and fracked natural gas producers.  Would they want the electric utility component to install thousands of solar panels and cut off the revenue from natural gas sales to the utility?  Of course not.<p>It&#x27;s a good argument for giving Alphabet the Ma Bell anti-trust treatment, certainly.\n\n  On the other hand, Alphabet&#x27;s inability to deploy GPT-3 or GPT-3.5 has led to the possibility of its disruption, so anti-trust treatment may not be necessary.\n\n    Disrupted by a whom? Microsoft? Facebook? The company formerly known as Twitter? Even if one of these takes over we&#x27;d just be trading masters.<p>And that&#x27;s ignoring how Alphabet&#x27;s core business, Search, has little to fear from GPT-3 or GPT-3.5. These models are decent for a chatbot, but for anything where you want reliably correct answers they are lacking.\n\n  A better example of that behaviour would be Kodak which invented the first digital camera as soon as 1975 then killed the project, because it was a threat to their chemical business.\n\n    Digital photography works not just because of the camera but because of the surrounding digital ecosystem. What would people do with digital photos in 1975?\n\n      We&#x27;ll never know. Tech delayed is tech denied.\n\n      It does not matter. In the 80s, they owned the whole photography market, now they only exist as a shell of it&#x27;s former self.<p>By not pursuing this tech, they basically committed corporate suicide over the long run and they knew it. They knew very well, especially going into the 90&#x27;s and early 2000 than their time making bank selling film was counted.<p>But as long as the money was there, the chemical branch of the company was all-powerful and likely prevented the creation of another competing product that would threaten its core business, and they did so right until the money flow stopped and suddenly they went basically bankrupt figuratively overnight since the cash cow was now obsolete.\n\n        Kodak did plenty of great things with digital cameras in the early 2000s. Their CCD sensors from then are still famous and coveted in some older cameras. Go look at the price of a Leica M8 (from 2006) on eBay.<p>The problem Kodak had is what the person you&#x27;re replying to is alluding to. They got outcompeted because they were a photography company, not a digital hardware manufacturer. Companies like Sony or Canon did better because they were in the business of consumer electronics &#x2F; hardware already. Building an amazing digital sensor and some good optics is great, but if you can&#x27;t write the firmware or make the PCB yourself, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time competing.<p>It&#x27;s not chemical-wing vs digital-wing. It&#x27;s that Kodak wasn&#x27;t (and rightly wasn&#x27;t) a computing hardware manufacturer, which makes it pretty damned hard to compete in making computing devices.<p>(Granted companies like Nikon or Leica etc did better, but it&#x27;s all pyrrhic now, because the whole category of consumer digital cameras is disappearing as people are content to take pictures on their phones.)\n\n          &gt;They got outcompeted because they were a photography company, not a digital hardware manufacturer. Companies like Sony or Canon did better because they were in the business of consumer electronics &#x2F; hardware already.<p>Huh?  This makes no sense.  Sony was indeed a consumer electronics company at that time, but Canon was not: Canon was a camera manufacturer.  They didn&#x27;t get into electronics until later as cameras became digital: their earlier cameras were the all-mechanical kind.  Sony was an electronics company that had to learn how to make cameras, but Canon was a camera company that had to learn how to make electronics.  Kodak could have done the same.\n\n            &gt; Kodak could have done the same.<p>Kodak, while they incidentally made some cameras, were a <i>film and film processing</i> company that wasn’t great at cameras and wasn’t anything in electronics.<p>They were much worse positioned than either a camera company, or a consumer electronics company, for a pivot to the post-film photography world.\n\n              Canon was only a camera company when it started, but by the 1960s was moving into other markets like lenses, magnetic heads, photocopiers, fax machines, etc.<p>Kodak could have diversified like that too, but they didn&#x27;t.  They were positioned badly because they concentrated almost all their efforts on film and nothing else.  Of course, part of this is probably due to American business culture compared to Japanese; Japanese businesses tend to be much more diverse and long-term in thinking, but regardless, Kodak did this to themselves.\n\n                Agreed but my additional point is that Kodak actually did branch out beyond film, and did so pretty well from a technical POV.<p>The problem was competing in hardware manufacturing, which is a whole different ballgame from concentrating on just the imaging aspects of it. So they were reduced, near the end, to just being really a (decent) component supplier to other companies. But that&#x27;s the wrong part of the food chain to be in.\n\n            What are you talking about? Canon was making copiers, printers, scanners, video cameras from the late 80s on.<p>So they were already making digital hardware and so presumably had the internal expertise on how to product manage that.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.canon&#x2F;en&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;history&#x2F;04.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.canon&#x2F;en&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;history&#x2F;04.html</a>\n\n              Ok, but they were a camera company before they moved into copiers and printers, right?<p>Obviously, they were well-positioned since they had already moved into electronics and such before the digital revolution happened.\n\n        1995 would have been a sensible time for them to pivot to digital. 1975 would not.\n\n        &gt; In the 80s, they [Kodak] owned the whole photography market,<p>No, they shared it with Fujifilm (1&#x2F;3rd each in 1990 according to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdgciv.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;05&#x2F;tfinnerty2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdgciv.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;05&#x2F;tfinnerty2.pdf</a>). And essentially via film, film processing but no significant camera market share, which is likely far more relevant to the transition to digital.\n\n        “Their days…were numbered” is more what a native speaker would say.\n\n  I was privy to the details of this. Sundar blocked the NEMA team from presenting at I&#x2F;O with its gpt3 level product in the form of a character.<p>Sundar was afraid of the technology and how it would be received and tried to ice it.\n\n    How is that not immediate grounds for his termination? The board should be canned too for allowing such an obvious charlatan to continue ruining the company.\n\n      Two judgements were made to my knowledge:<p>1) Google enjoyed significant market status at the time and a leap forward like seemingly semi conscious AI in 2019 would be seen as terrifying. Consumer sentiment would go from positive to “Google is winning to hard and making Frankensteins monster”<p>2) it didn’t weave well into googles current product offering and in fact disrupted it in ways that would confuse the user. It was not yet productized but would already make the Google assistant (which at the time was rapidly expanding) look stupid.<p>A fictional character companion was not clearly a good path.<p>All this being said, I integrated the early tech into my product division and even I couldn’t fully grasp what it would become. Then was canned right at the moment it became clear what we could do.<p>Eric Schmidt was the only leader at Google who recognized nascent tech at Google and effectively fast tracked it. When my team made breakthroughs in word to vec which created the suggestion chip in chat&#x2F;email he immediately took me to the board to demo and said this was the future. (This ironically wound a long path to contribute later to transformer tech)<p>Sundar often ignored such things and would put on a McKensey face projecting everyone just was far dumber than him and his important problems.\n\n        The first time I met with Eric Schmidt he asked what I did (harvest idle cycles to do scientific calculations), and then we talked about how Google was slowly getting into cloud.  I remember him saying &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to convince the board that the cloud is the future of growth for google, but they aren&#x27;t interested&quot; (this was before GCS and GCE launched).<p>The second time I met him I presented my project (Google Cloud Genomics) to the board of the Broad Institute, of which he was a member (IIRC the chair) and he was excited that Google was using cloud to help biology.\n\n          The irony, of course, with that, is that then Google&#x2F;Alphabet like Microsoft eat its lunch in the space by poorly supporting The Broad and allowing Verily to sign a $150m deal with Azure.  Quite a few of the folks who were working on HCLS products in Cloud (were you one of them?) subsequently departed for Verily.\n\n            I worked on the predecessor of HCLS and was pushed out before any Azure deal (and would never have moved to verily).  I had set up a relationship between Google Research, the Broad, and Cloud (to apply large-scale Google ML technology in genomics) and all that went away when other folks took it in different strategic direction.<p>The Broad is still a google cloud customer and verily seems to support all three clouds now, but I&#x27;m not aware of the details.  The whole thing seemed really strange and unbusinesslike.\n\n        This is a good illustration of why the common sentiment that &quot;capitalism drives innovation&quot; is ... not exactly accurate.\n\n  Honestly, this is part of the reason why I don&#x27;t think Google will be a dominant business in 10 years. Searching the web for information helped us service a lot of useful &#x27;jobs to be done&#x27; ... but most of those are now all done better by ChatGPT, Claude, etc.<p>Sure we have Gemini but can Google take a loss in revenue in search advertising in their existing product to maybe one day make money from Gemini search? Advertising in the LLM interface hasn&#x27;t been figured out yet.<p>Google (kind of) feels like an old school newspaper in the age of the internet. Advertising models for the web took a while to shake out.\n\nTransformer == Modern AI?\nWow, I dont know where should I start\nMy mind literally stuck at the absurdity\n\n  AI is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n    And in this case, the transformers are more than meets the eye.\n\n      I’m sure there’s a beam search joke in here somewhere but it’s too late in the day for me to think about it.\n\n  It&#x27;s 2024; do we <i>really</i> have to point out the fact that publications take liberties with headlines?  It&#x27;s been that way forever.<p>Besides that, are you denying that transformers are the fundamental piece behind all the AI hype today?  That&#x27;s the point of the article.  I think the fact that a mainstream publication is writing about the Transformers paper is awesome.\n\n    OK, so the title should be changed to &quot;8 Google Employees Invented Modern AI Hype&quot;?\n\n      8 Google Employees authored the Transformer paper, which is the common architecture of all LLMs\n\n    AI hipsterism\n\n    Modern AI is such a big term that its way off the scale of normal click-baiting...<p>Modern AI should anything after <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dartmouth_workshop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dartmouth_workshop</a> \nNot transformer<p>AI has been people&#x27;s dream since written history. i.e., everyone in their own sense would want to invent something that can do things and think for themselves. That&#x27;s literally the meaning of AI.\n\n    What makes transformers the fundamental piece over say, big datasets, or Moore&#x27;s law, or deep nets in general, etc?\n\n  Do you think this current AI hype machine came from something other than transformers?\n\n    No, but it is weird to use &quot;modern&quot; here. Modern suggest a longer timeframe. I would say machine learning deep NNs is modern AI. It&#x27;s just not true that everything not transformer is outdated, but it is &quot;kinda&quot; true that everything not deep NN is outdated.\n\n      &gt; It&#x27;s just not true that everything not transformer is outdated.<p>Am not expert, do you have some links about this? i.e. a neural net construction that outperforms a transformer model of the same size.\n\n        ConvNets Match Vision Transformers at Scale (Oct 2023)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2310.16764\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2310.16764</a>\n\n        Well transformers still have some plausible competition in NLP but besides that, there are other fields of AI where convnets or RNNs still make a lot of sense.\n\n      The phrasing kinda makes sense to me.<p>Consider &quot;modern&quot; to mean NN&#x2F;connectionist vs GOFAI AI attempts like CYC or SOAR.<p>I guess it depends on how you define &quot;AI&quot;, and whether you accept the media&#x27;s labelling of anything ML-related as AI.<p>To me, LLMs are the first thing deserving to be called AI, and other NNs like CNNs better just called ML since there is no intelligence there.\n\n        But that&#x27;s been the case for the last 60 years.  Whatever came out in the last 10 years is the first thing deserving to be called AI, and everything else is just basic computer science algorithms that every practitioner should know.  Eliza was AI in 1967; now it&#x27;s just string substitution.  Prolog was AI in 1972; now it&#x27;s logic programming.  Beam search and A* were AI in the 1970s; now they&#x27;re just search algorithms.  Expert systems were AI in the 1980s; now they&#x27;re just rules engines.  Handwriting recognition, voice recognition, and speech synthesis were AI in the 90s; now they&#x27;re just multilayer perceptrons aka artificial neural nets.  SVMs were AI in the 00s; now they&#x27;re just support vector machines.  CNNs and LSTMs were AI in the 10s; now they&#x27;re just CNNs and LSTMs.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AI_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AI_effect</a>\n\n          Yeah, but for a while it seemed we&#x27;d gotten over that, and in the &quot;modern era&quot; people were just talking about ML. Nobody in 2012, as best I can recall, was referring to AlexNet as &quot;AI&quot;, but then (when did it start?) at some point the media started calling everything AI, and eventually the ML community capitulated and started calling it that too - maybe because the VC&#x27;s wanted to invest in sexy AI, not ML.\n\n        &gt; Consider &quot;modern&quot; to mean NN&#x2F;connectionist vs GOFAI AI attempts like CYC or SOAR.<p>Well this is what Im trying to say too!\n\n        <i>Consider &quot;modern&quot; to mean NN&#x2F;connectionist vs GOFAI AI attempts like CYC or SOAR.</i><p>I dunno. The earliest research into what we now call &quot;neural networks&quot; dates back to at least the 1950&#x27;s (Frank Rosenblatt and the Perceptron) and arguably into the 1940&#x27;s (Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts and the TLU &quot;neuron&quot;). And depending on how generous one is with their interpretation of certain things, arguments have been made that the history of neural network research dates back to before the invention of the digital computer altogether, or even before electrical power was ubiquitous (eg, late 1800&#x27;s). Regarding the latter bit, I believe it was Jurgen Schmidhuber who advanced that argument in an interview I saw a while back and as best as I can recall, he was referring to a certain line of mathematical research from that era.<p>In the end, defining &quot;modern&quot; is probably not something we&#x27;re ever going to reach consensus on, but I really think your proposal misses the mark by a small touch.\n\n          Sure, the history of NNs goes back a while, but nobody was attempting to build AI out of perceptrons (single layer), which were famously criticized as not being able to even implement an XOR function.<p>The modern era of NNs started with being able to train multilayer neural nets using backprop, but the ability to train NNs large enough to actually be useful for complex things AI research, can arguably be dated to the 2012 Imagenet competition when Geoff Hinton&#x27;s team repurposed GPUs to train AlexNet.<p>But, AlexNet was just a CNN, a classifier, which IMO is better just considered as ML, not AI, so if we&#x27;re looking for the first AI in this post-GOFAI world of NN-based experimentation, then it seems we have to give the nod to transformer-based LLMs.\n\n    No, but &quot;modern AI&quot; and &quot;this current AI hype machine&quot; are not equivalent phrases.\n\n    Current AI hype comes from GPT<p>Transformer+Scaling+$$$ triggered the current hype\n\n  Transformer is an evolution of large scale training of seq2seq. Diffusion models is an evolution of even older approach - training denoising autoencoders.<p>It had been a relatively gradual and accelerating progress, with number of people working in the field increasing exponentially, since 2010 or so, when Deep Learning on GPUs was popularized at NIPS by Theano.<p>Tens of thousands people working together on Deep Learning. Many more on GPUs.\n\n  Modern AI != Machine Learning. Artificial intelligence has always been about models being able to accomplish a broad swath of tasks that they weren&#x27;t explicitly trained on. It seems hard to argue we had accomplished this before massive transformers came along.\n\nI thought level 4+ self-driving was going to be the face of &quot;modern AI&quot;... instead we got this thing\n\n  Why do you think transformers won&#x27;t be key in making a level 4+ self-driving AI. It seems to me that Vision-capable multi-modal transformers could be the missing part: they can understand what is happening in the world in a deductive way.<p>The Vision transformer is capable of predicting that a running child is likely to follow that rolling soccer ball. It is capable of deducting that a particular situation looks dangerous or unusual and it should slow down, or stay away from danger in ways that previous crop of AI could not.<p>Imo, the only thing currently preventing transformers to change everything is the large amount of compute power required to run them. It&#x27;s not currently possible to imagine GPT4-V running on a embedded computer inside a car. Maybe AI asic type of chip will solve that issue, maybe Edge computing and 5G will find it&#x27;s use-case... Let&#x27;s wait and see, but I would bet that transformer will find it&#x27;s way in many places and change the world in many more ways than bringing us chatbots.\n\n    Bandwidth alone isn’t what prevents 5G from this sort of application, at least in the USA. Coverage maps tell the story: coverage is generally spotty away from major roads. Cell coverage isn’t a fixable problem in the near term, because every solution for doing that intersects with negative political externalities (antivax, NIMBYism, etc); if you can get people vaccinated for measles consistently again, then we can talk.<p>It all needs to be onboard. That’s where money should be going.\n\n      Quantized models could absolutely be run in-car. They can already be run on cell phones.\n\n        If you plan on letting llava-v1.5-7b drive your car, please stay away from me.<p>More seriously, for safety critical applications, LLM have some serious limitations (most obviously hallucinations). Still, I beleive they could work in automotive application assuming: high quality of the output (better than current SoA) and very high token count (hundreds or even thousand of token&#x2F;s and more), allowing to bruteforce the problem and run many inferences per seconds.<p>Clearly we are not there yet.\n\n          Could combine the existing real-time driving model with influence from the LLM, as an improvement to allow understanding of unusual situations, or as a cross-check?<p>I wasn&#x27;t intending to say it would be useful today, but pushing back against what I understood to be an argument that, once we do have a model we&#x27;d trust, it won&#x27;t be possible to run it in-car. I think it absolutely would be. The massive GPU compute requirements apply to training, not inference -- especially as we discover that quantization is surprisingly effective.\n\n    I think we&#x27;ve found repeatedly in self-driving that it&#x27;s not enough to solve the problem in the normal case.  You need an AI model that has good behaviors in the edge cases.  For the most part it won&#x27;t matter how good the vision models get, you&#x27;re going to need similar models that can make the same predictions from LIDAR signals because the technology needs to work when the vision model goes crazy because of the reflectivity of a surface or other such edge cases where it completely misunderstands where the object is.\n\n      I don&#x27;t quite agree on this one. While I think that Musk choices to go full vision when he did was foulish because he made his product worse, his main point is not wrong: human do drive well while using mostly vision. Assuming you can replicate the thought process of human driver using AI, I don&#x27;t see why you could not create a self-driving car using only vision.<p>That&#x27;s also where I would see transformers or another AI architecture with reasoning capabilities shine: the fact that it can reason about what is about to happen would allow it to handle edge cases much better than relying on dumb sensors.<p>As a human, it would be very difficult to drive a car just looking at sensor data. The only vehicule I can think of where we do that is submarines. Sensors data is good for classical AI but I don&#x27;t think it will handle edge case well.<p>To be a reasonable self-driving system, it should be able to decide to slow down and maintain a reasonable safety space because it is judging the car in front to be driving erratically (ex: due to driver impairement). Only an AI that can reason about what is going on can do that.\n\n        &gt; As a human, it would be very difficult to drive a car just looking at sensor data.<p>What is vision if not sensor data?? Our brains have evolved to efficiently process and interpret image data. I don&#x27;t see why from-scratch neural network architectures should ever be limited to the same highly specific input type.\n\n          Can’t argue with this logic, more data points certainly helps. I was arguing about vision vs lidar, vision + lidar is certainly better than vision alone.\n\n        Sure but humans do a lot more with vision than just convolutions. So maybe we need to wait for AI to invent new techniques equally revolutionary and equally impactful to convolutions to the point where it&#x27;s believable that AI models can handle the range of exceptions humans handle.  Humans are very good at learning from small data where AI tends to be pretty terrible at one-shot learning by comparison. That&#x27;s going to continue being hugely relevant for edge cases. We&#x27;ve seen many examples now where a self-driving car crashes due to too much sunlight distorting its perception of where objects are. We can either bury our heads in the sand and pretend AI models work like humans and need the exact same inputs humans do or we can admit there are limitations to the technology and act accordingly.<p>I also think dumb sensors is unfair, there are Neural Network solutions for processing LIDAR data so we are talking about a similar level of intelligence applied over both sensors.\n\n  I think LLMs provide more utility than further dependence on cars.\n\n  All modern AI is based on this, including self driving. Check out Waymo&#x27;s research papers. They even have something called &quot;Wayformer&quot;.\n\nIn Google&#x27;s heyday, around 2014, I was talking with Uszkoreit about a possible role on his then NLP team.<p>I asked &quot;What would you do if you had an unlimited budget?&quot;<p>He simply said, &quot;I do&quot;\n\n  Nice story, but Google&#x27;s heyday was probably 10 years before that. By 2014 the decline had already started.\n\n    A little after that.  I&#x27;d put the heyday between 2003-2010, starting with the GMail launch and ending with the Chrome &amp; Android launches.  That period includes GMail, Maps, Scholar, Orkut, Reader, the acquisitions of Blogger&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Docs&#x2F;Sheets&#x2F;Slides&#x2F;Analytics&#x2F;Android, Summer of Code, OAuth, Translate, Voice Search, search suggestions, universal search, Picasa, etc.  Basically I can look at my phone or computer and basically everything I routinely use dates from that period.\n\n      GMail, the service that tells every user that they will be indexed and profiled personally for ad leads?  <i>that</i> is an achievement ?<p>GMail was one of the red flags for many that &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; was not going to be what it appeared. History says that this kind of mass profiling never ends well.\n\n        Gmail doesn&#x27;t show personalized ads for some years FWIW.\n\n    Agreed. I remember the town hall meeting where they announced the transition to being Alphabet. My manager was flying home from the US at the time. He left a Google employee and landed an Alphabet employee. \nI know it was probably meaningless in any real sense, but when they dropped the Dont Be Evil motto, it was a sign that the fun times were drawing to an end.\n\n  Hahaha...<p>I worked at Borg<p>The quota system can kick in at whatever time the limits are reached.<p>And GPUs are scattered across borg cells, limiting the ceiling. That&#x27;s why XBorg was created so that a global search among all Borg cells for researchers.<p>And data center Capex is around 5 billion each year.<p>Google makes hundres of billions of revenue each year.<p>You are asking what people would do in impossible situation. Like &quot;what you do after you are dead&quot;, literally I could do nothing after I am dead.<p>I cannot even understand what I do stands for in the context of your question. The above is my direct reaction in the line that he assumes he had unlimited budget.\n\n    &gt; I cannot even understand what I do stands for in the context of your question<p>That he had a higher budget than he knew what to do with. When I worked at Google I could bring up thousands of workers doing big tasks for hours without issue whenever I wanted, for me that was the same as being infinite since I never needed more, and that team didn&#x27;t even have a particularly large budget. I can see a top ML team having enough compute budget to run a task on the entire Google scrape index dataset every day to test things, you don&#x27;t need that much to do that, I wasn&#x27;t that far from that.<p>At that point the issue is no longer budget but time for these projects to run and return a result. Of course that was before LLMs, the models before then weren&#x27;t that expensive.\n\n      Sure, your explanation just matches what I was imaging.\nNeither the question nor the answer made any sense.\n\n      I know a Google operations guy who has occasionally complained that the developers act like computing&#x2F;network resources are infinite, so this made me chuckle.\n\n    Lighten up.\n\n  I shared an office with Uszkoreit when I was a phd intern and I always admired him for him having dropped out of his phd program.\n\n    The HR system has (had?) “abd” as an education level&#x2F;degree between MS and PhD\n\n  Those were fun times! (&amp; great to see you again after all these years). It&#x27;s astonishing to me how far the tech has come given what we were working on at the time.\n\nAnd none of them still work for Google. It’s truly baffling that Google’s CEO still has a job after how badly he fumbled on AI.\n\n  Just like Xerox and Bell. Innovation isn’t necessarily their most important job, at least when innovations are being made.\n\n  He was too distracted with all the other things going on under his watch. He spent too much time trying to convince rank and file that it&#x27;s OK to do business with customers they don&#x27;t like, trying to ensure arbitrary hiring goals were made, and appeasing the internal activists that led protests and pressured to exit people that didn&#x27;t fall in line.<p>This is why the CEO of Coinbase sent the memo a few years back stating that these types of people (not mission focused, self absorbed, and distracting) should leave the company. The CEO of Google should be fired.\n\n    How has he been appeasing internal activists? He&#x27;s been pretty clear about firing them<p>Edit: I&#x27;m also unclear on what makes you think he&#x27;s spending much time on &quot;arbitrary hiring goals&quot;. I remember an initiative for hiring in a wider variety, also conveniently much cheaper, locations but there wasn&#x27;t indication he was personally spending time on it\n\n    It is intellectually dishonest to call the military-industrial complex merely &quot;customers that some Google employees didn&#x27;t like&quot;.<p>Humans are more than their companies&#x27; mission, and your freedom to exercise your political views on how companies should be run inherently relies on this principle, too. So your argument is fundamentally a hypocrites projection.\n\n      “ Humans are more than their companies&#x27; mission”<p>Not when they’re on the clock.<p>Besides, many of the Google employees who are against defense projects are against them because <i>those projects actively target their home countries</i>. Much harder problem to fix!\n\n        I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re being sarcastic or not. Obviously you don&#x27;t get to ignore your morals and values just because you&#x27;re currently employed by someone?\n\n  Among other things (like cloud for instance). I always think Sundar is the Steve Ballmer of Google.\n\n  Well, ads are doing well.\n\n  Their wildest success at Google would have meant the company&#x27;s stock price doubling or tripling and their stock grants being worth a couple million dollars at most. Meanwhile all of them had blank checks from top VCs in the valley and the freedom to do whatever they wanted with zero oversight. What exactly could Sundar have done to retain them?\n\n    It would have gone much better for Google if the Brain team had been permitted to apply their work, but they were repeatedly blocked on stated grounds of AI safety and worries about impacting existing business lines through negative PR. I think this is probably the biggest missed business opportunity of the past decade, and much of the blame for losing key talent and Google&#x27;s head start in LLMs ultimately resides with Sundar, although there are managers in between with their own share of the blame.\n\n      They should have been spun out with a few billion dollars budget, no oversight, and Google having 90% (or some other very high %) ownership and rights of first purchase to buy them back.<p>It is a successful model that has worked again and again to escape the problem of corporate bureaucracy.\n\n        Interestingly Google itself has followed this model with Waymo. Employees got Waymo stock not Google, and there was even speculation that Google took on outside investors. It&#x27;s weird to me that they didn&#x27;t consider generative AI would be as game changing as self driving cars, especially considering the tech was right in front of them.\n\n      Funnily enough, the same AI safety teams that held Google back from using large transformers in products are also largely responsible for the Gemini image generation debacle.<p>It is tough to find the right balance though, because AI safety is not something you want to brush off.\n\n        I thought Google fired it&#x27;s AI Ethicists a few years back and dismantled the team?\n\n          Ethics != Safety. Also, Google still has both afaik\n\n        &gt; AI safety is not something you want to brush off<p>It really depends on what exactly is meant by &quot;safety&quot;, because this word is used in several different (and largely unrelated) meanings in this context.<p>The actual value of the kind of &quot;safety&quot; that led to the Gemini debacle is very unclear to me.\n\n  I&#x27;m not 100% sure I agree...<p>Google is an ad company at the end of the day. Google is still making obscene amount of money with ads. Currently Gen AI is a massive expense in training and running and is only looking like it may harm future ad revenue (yet to be seen). Meanwhile OpenAI has not surpassed that critical threshold where they dominate the market with a moat and become a trillion dollar company. It is typically very hard for a company to change what they actually do, so much so that in the vast majority of cases its much more effective (money wise) to switch from developing products to becoming a rent seeking utility by means of lobbying and regulation.<p>Simply put, Google itself could not have succeeded with GenAI without an outside competitor as it would have become its own competition and the CEO would have been removed for such a blunder.\n\n    &gt;it may harm future ad revenue (yet to be seen)<p>It harms ad revenue at the moment.<p>For some specific queries (like code-related), I now go to chat.openai.com before google.com, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one.<p>AI is the only thing that can put an end to Google&#x27;s dominance of the web. I also have no idea how Sundar still has a job there.\n\n    Google is an AI&#x2F;ML company that has shoehorned AI&#x2F;ML researchers into working on ads to pay the bills.\n\n    Classic Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma case study.\n\n    &gt;  It is typically very hard for a company to change what they actually do<p>Microsoft started out selling BASIC runtimes. Then they moved into operating systems. Then they moved into Cloud. Satya seems to be putting his money where his mouth is and working hard to transition the company to AI now.<p>Apple has likewise undergone multiplet transformations over the decades.<p>However Google has the unique problem that their main cash cow is absurdly lucrative and has been an ongoing source of extreme income for multiple decades now, where as other companies typically can&#x27;t get away with a single product line keeping them on top of the world for 20+ years. (Windows being an exception, maybe Microsoft is an exception, but say what you will about MS, they pushed technology forward throughout the 90s and accomplished their goal of a PC in every house)\n\n      Also, though I dislike it greatly, Microsoft purchasing GitHub was a brilliant way to buy into a growing segment which were natively hostile to what they stand for. LinkedIn, maybe less clever, they only make pocket change on it, but it is profitable.<p>Google doesn&#x27;t really do acquisitions on that level. They do buy companies, but with the purpose of incorporating their biological distinctiveness into the collective. This tends to highlight their many failures in capturing new markets. The last high-profile successful purchase by Google, that I recall at least, were YouTube and Android, nearly twenty years ago.\n\n        Waze was bought 10 years ago, and I think that one went well. They didn&#x27;t try to integrate it to the whole Google Account thing, but they definitely share data between it and Maps (so Waze users get better maps, and Google Maps gets better live traffic information).\n\n      Office was the cash cow compared to windows.\n\n        Microsoft effectively controlling the PC market as a platform to sell Excel is akin to Google controlling web standards as a platform to sell ads.\n\n        Now is Active directory + Office 365 + Teams\n\n      Remember that Microsoft spent 10 years fighting the open internet, and only launched the cloud much later.  The Windows business was allergic to the web-model, and they fought it tooth and nail.\n\n        In fairness, the web model tends to be objectively worse in every way except profits.\n\n    It&#x27;s not about just ad revenue though, is it? Many thousands, if not millions of sites rely entirely on Google Search for their revenue. You cannot simply replace all of them with a chatbot - there are massive consequences to such decisions.\n\n      &gt;It&#x27;s not about just ad revenue though, is it? Many thousands, if not millions of sites rely entirely on Google Search for their revenue.<p>I mean these are kind of tangled together. Chatbots actively dilute real sites from what we are seeing, by feeding back into their fake into googles index in order to capture some of the ad revenue. This leads to the &quot;Gee Google is really sucking&quot; meme we see  more and more often. The point is, Google had an absolute cash cow and the march towards GenAI AGI threatens to interrupt that model just as much as it promises to to make the AGI winner insanely rich.\n\n  I think the issue is that there is no future for a <i>trustworthy</i> AI that doesn&#x27;t completely cannibalize their ad revenue cash cow.<p>Like, who wants to use an AI that says things like, &quot;... and that&#x27;s why you should wear sunscreen outside. Speaking of skin protection, you should try Banana Boat&#x27;s new Ultra 95 SPF sunscreen.&quot;\n\n    Yeah, but isn&#x27;t the idea to cannibalize your own products before someone else does?!<p>In any case, consumer chatbots isn&#x27;t the only way to sell the tech. Lot&#x27;s of commercial use too.<p>I don&#x27;t see why ads couldn&#x27;t be integrated with chatbots too for that matter. There&#x27;s no point serving them outside of a context where the user appears to be interested in a product&#x2F;service, and in that case there are various ways ads could be displayed&#x2F;inserted.\n\n    You are not imaginative enough.\n\n    &quot;Based on the research I have available wearing sunscreen with a SPF at or greater than 95 is the most likely to prevent the harmful effects of sunburn&quot;.<p>Go to google -&gt; Search &quot;sunscreen&quot; -&gt; (Sponsored) Banana Boat new Ultra 95 SPF sunscreen<p>Oh wow! 95 SPF!

Speaking of skin protection, you should try Banana Boat&#x27;s new Ultra 95 SPF sunscreen.&quot;<p>On the other hand, their history suggests most people would be fine with an AI which did this as long as it was accurate:<p>&gt; ... and that&#x27;s why you should wear sunscreen outside.<p>&gt; Sponsored by: Banana Boat&#x27;s new Ultra 95 SPF sunscreen…&quot;\n\n  I mean if you had the pedigree these people have, the right move is to leave a big company and go start your own thing, there is simply a lot more upside there. You’d be foolish to stay with a big company, not sure what Google could have done here. Not everyone wants to be Jeff Dean.\n\n  Google doesn&#x27;t have to try to be the best at AI now, it can just buy whoever is the winner later - a lesson learned from google video.\n\n    No Google can&#x27;t just buy the winner.<p>Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion (and I recall that seemed overpriced at the time).<p>The way VC works for private companies now is completely different than in 2006.\n\n    If that winner turns out to be OpenAI and they attempt to buy them it&#x27;ll be blocked by regulators instantly.\n\nIt&#x27;s pretty crazy to think that Google is not OpenAI today, they had deep mind and an army of PHDs early on.\n\n  What is OpenAI today? Can you elaborate? Google is a varied $trillion company. OpenAI sells access to large generative models.\n\n    Sure, Google is worth more but they essentially reduced themselves to an ad business. They aren&#x27;t focused on innovation as much as before. Shareholder value is the new god.\n\n      Agreed that Friedman cursed the market with &quot;shareholder theory&quot;, and it is a totally subversive and corrupting concept because whatever will increase value is accepted because it&#x27;s the doctrine.\n\n        Economic &quot;theories&quot; have an annoying way of being self-fulfilling.\n\n      An ad business is all Google ever was. But they made 20 billion in profits last quarter. Why mess with a good thing? Innovator’s Dilemma.<p>Also, to be fair, OpenAI’s huge valuation is only a promise right now. Hopefully they will eventually turn profitable…\n\n      Shareholder value is fine. Share seller value is what is targeted.\n\n    Where would most people want to work is the question. This is all a talent game.\n\n  Well at the time before Microsoft got involved it was sort of an unspoken rule among the AI community to be open and not release certain models to the public.\n\n    I think that was because it become a product that point.\n\n    To be open and not release? Isn&#x27;t that at odds?\n\n  I think it’s evidence that timing is everything. In the 2010s deep learning was still figuring out how to leverage GPUs. The scale of compute required for everything after GPT-2 would have been nearly impossible in 2017&#x2F;2018–our courses at Udacity used a few hours of time on K80 GPUs. By  2020 it was becoming possible to get unbelievable amounts of compute to throw at these models to test the scale hypothesis. The rise of LLMs is stark proof of the Bitter Lesson because it’s at least as much the story of GPU advancement as it is about algorithms.\n\n  The problem is that chatting with an LLM is extremely disruptive to their business model and it&#x27;s difficult for them to productize without killing the golden goose.\n\n    Yes, but Google&#x27;s search volume would make it impossible either way.<p>But they are probably using various techniques in analyses, embeddings, &quot;canned&quot; answers to queries, and so on.\n\n    I know everyone cites this as the innovators dilemma, but so far the evidence suggests this isn&#x27;t true.<p>ChatGPT has been around for a while now, and it hasn&#x27;t led to a collapse in Google&#x27;s search revenue, and in fact now Google is rushing to roll out their version instead of trying to entrench search.<p>A famous example is the iPhone killing the iPod, and it took around 3 and a half years for the iPod to really collapse, so chat and co-pilots might be early still. On the other hand handheld consumer electronics have much longer buying cycles than software tools.\n\n      maybe its too early. I almost never google search anymore, a lot of my friends do the same. Kind of like after I was using google for years, lots and lots of people were still using sites like ask jeaves, but the writing was on the wall\n\n        Maybe. I can&#x27;t be the only one who gets irked by the slow, typing-out response from copilot&#x2F;gpt when google gets me instant results. Near instant or a lot faster result might convince me to use whatever gpt search\n\n          honestly I use the free version and the text is really fast. Lets take a look at a typical question I may send to chat gpt:<p>&gt;I have some tasks, some of them maintenance, some of them relaxation that I do &gt;before bed. For example, maintenance:\n&gt;brush teeth, floss, water floss, put on nose strips, take prylosec.\n&gt;For relaxation:\n&gt;stretch, massage gun, ASMR, music, tiger balm, salt bath, movie, tea, nasal &gt;clean, moisturize.\n&gt;can you suggest some others tasks?<p>Google can&#x27;t even handle this. if you try, the entire page is filled with Videos: ... with 4 video thumbnails from youtube on how to use a water pic.<p>So I scroll off down (by now chat gpt already has a response) half a page on &#x27;people also ask&#x27; with 4 questions about water pics, keep scrolling,<p>finally search results, and all of them are about ... water pics&#x2F;flossers.\n\n      Google is big enough to avoid innovators dilemma. You just create a new company and leave it alone.<p>I reckon it is more that you needed special circumstances and series\nof events to become OpenAI. Not just cash and smart people.\n\n      &gt; ChatGPT has been around for a while now<p>ChatGPT has been around for less that 15 months[1]. In what version of reality is that &quot;a while now&quot;? Your iPhone&#x2F;iPod timeline is also off by about 9 years[2].<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ChatGPT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ChatGPT</a>\n2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IPod_Shuffle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IPod_Shuffle</a>\n\n        &#x27;A while now&#x27; being long enough that I might expect <i>some</i> notable impact on Google&#x27;s business by now. I do agree it could just be too early.<p>My iPhone&#x2F;iPod timeline is referring to the time it took for the iPod&#x27;s sales to be severely impacted [1]. I&#x27;m not disputing that the iPod continued to exist for a long time, the iPod Touch wasn&#x27;t discontinued until 2022, but it was a pretty meaningless part of Apple&#x27;s business by that point.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.insider.com&#x2F;597b68f2b50ab162018b466b?width=1300&amp;format=jpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.insider.com&#x2F;597b68f2b50ab162018b466b?width=1300&amp;fo...</a>\n\n          Blackberry chugged along with record profits for a couple of years after the iphone had already made them irrelevant.\n\n            Yea, this is a good example that it might just be too soon still to say.<p>There was a period where it was not obvious that the iPhone or Blackberry would become the dominant player in the field and it could be true with search and AI chat etc too.\n\n    Sounds like Xerox all over again.\n\n    No, I think very few people truly believed that a souped-up SmarterChild would be all that interesting. Google focused more on winning board games.\n\n    Ironically they killed the golden goose (the web) with display ads which incentivized low quality content to keep users scrolling. To put salt in their own wound, they are now indexing ever more genAI crap than they can handle and search is imploding.\n\n    No, it&#x27;s the other way around. Right now web search is &quot;disruptive&quot; to the LLM business model.<p>Google is a business fundamentally oriented around loss leaders. They make money on commercial queries where someone wants to buy something. They lose money when people search for facts or knowledge. The model works because people don&#x27;t want to change their search engine every five minutes, so being good at the money losing queries means people will naturally use you for the money making queries too.<p>Right now LLMs take all the money losing queries and spend vast sums of investor capital on serving them, but they are useless for queries like [pizza near me] or [medical injury legal advice] or [holidays in the canary islands]. So right now I&#x27;d expect actually Google to do quite well. Their competitor is burning capital taking away all the stuff that they don&#x27;t really want, whilst leaving them with the gold.<p>Now of course, that&#x27;s today. The obvious direction for OpenAI to go in is finding ways to integrate ads with the free version of ChatGPT. But that&#x27;s super hard. Building an ad network is hard. It takes a lot of time and effort, and it&#x27;s really unclear what the product looks like there. Ads on web search is pretty obvious: the ads look like search results. What does an ad look like in a ChatGPT response?<p>Google have plenty of time to figure this out because OpenAI don&#x27;t seem interested. They&#x27;ve apparently decided that all of ChatGPT is a loss leader for their API services. Whether that&#x27;s financially sustainable or not is unclear, but it&#x27;s also irrelevant. People still want to do commercial queries, they still want things like real images and maps and yes even ads (the way the ad auction works on Google is a very good ranking signal for many businesses). ChatGPT is still useless for them, so for now they will continue to leave money on the table where Google can keep picking it up.\n\n  They&#x27;d have to fall pretty far to be OpenAI.\n\nAttention models? Attention existed before those papers. What they did was show that it was enough to predict next word sequences in a certain context.  I&#x27;m certain they didn&#x27;t realize what they found. We used this frame work in 2018 and it gave us wildly unusual behavior (but really fun) and we tried to solve it (really looking for HF capability more than RL) but we didn&#x27;t see what another group found: that scale in compute with simple algorithms were just better.  To argue one group discovered and changed AI and ignore all the other groups is really annoying.  I&#x27;m glad for these researchers.  They deserve the accolade but they didn&#x27;t invent modern AI.  They advanced it.  In an interesting way.  But even now we want to return to a more deterministic approach.  World models.  Memory.  Graph.  Energy minimization.  Generative is fun and it taught us something but I&#x27;m not sure we can just keep adding more and more chips to solve AGI&#x2F;SGI through compute.  Or maybe we can.  But that paper is not written yet.\n\n  I’m studying neuroscience but very interested in how ai works. I’ve read up on the old school but phrases like memory graph and energy minimization are new to me. What modern papers&#x2F;articles would you recommend for folks who want to learn more?\n\n    For phrases, Google&#x27;s TF glossary [0] is a good resource, but it does not cover certain subsets of AI (and more specifically, is mostly focused on TensorFlow).<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;glossary\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;glossary</a>\n\n    If you are in neuroscience I would recommend looking into neural radiance fields rendering as well. I find it fascinating since it&#x27;s essentially an over-fitted neural network.\n\n    Someone put this link up on another discussion the other day and I found it really fascinating:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bbycroft.net&#x2F;llm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bbycroft.net&#x2F;llm</a><p>I believe energy minimization is literal, just look at the size of that thing and imagine the power bill.\n\n    He is most likely referring to some sort of free energy minimization.\n\n  &gt; but we didn&#x27;t see what another group found: that scale in compute with simple algorithms were just better<p>The bitter lesson [0] strikes again.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incompleteideas.net&#x2F;IncIdeas&#x2F;BitterLesson.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incompleteideas.net&#x2F;IncIdeas&#x2F;BitterLesson.html</a>\n\n    I kind of wonder if the reason this seems to be true is that emergent systems are just able to go a lot farther into much more complex design spaces than any system a human mind is capable of constructing.\n\n      I think this is overly general. A more accurate statement is that, on tasks where we don&#x27;t actually understand how something works in precise detail, it&#x27;s more effective to just throw compute at it until a system with &quot;innate&quot; understanding emerges. But if you do actually know how something works (rather than vague models with no clear supporting evidence), it&#x27;s still more effective to engineer the system specifically based on that knowledge.\n\n  In fairness, an article that’s about “the Google engineers who incrementally advanced AI” wouldn’t sell many advertisements.\n\n  I guess the same thing happened with special relativity and Poincaré was forgotten.\n\n  I argue they definitely &#x27;changed AI&#x27; but definitely agree they didn&#x27;t &#x27;invent modern AI&#x27;.<p>Personally, I think both compute and NN architecture is probably needed to get closer to AGI.\n\n  This is a classic... This isn&#x27;t the first time this piece has been posted before either. Here&#x27;s one from FT last year[0] or Bloomberg[1]. You can find more. Google certainly played a major role, but it is too far to say they invented it or that they are the ones that created modern AI. Like Einstein said, shoulder of giants. And realistically, those giants are just a bunch of people in trench coats. Millions of researchers being unrecognized. I don&#x27;t want to undermine the work of these researchers, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should also undermine the work of the many others (and thank god for the mathematicians who get no recognition and lay all the foundation for us).<p>And of course, a triggered Yann[2] (who is absolutely right).<p>But it is odd since it is actually a highly discussed topic, the history of attention. It&#x27;s been discussed on HN many times before. And of course there&#x27;s Lilian Weng&#x27;s very famous blog post[3] that covers this in detail.<p>The word attention goes back well over a decade and even before Schmidhuber&#x27;s usage. He has a reasonable claim but these things are always fuzzy and not exactly clear.<p>At least the article is more correct specifying Transformer rather than Attention, but even this is vague at best. FFormer (FFT-Transformer) was a early iteration and there were many variants. Do we call a transformer a residual attention mechanism with a residual feed forward? Can it be a convolution? There is no definitive definition but generally people mean DPMHA w&#x2F; skip layer + a processing network w&#x2F; skip layer. But this can be reflective of many architectures since every network can be decomposed into subnetworks. This even includes a 3 layer FFN (1 hidden layer).<p>Stories are nice, but I think it is bad to forget all the people who are contribution in less obvious ways. If a butterfly can cause a typhoon, then even a poor paper can contribute to a revolution.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;37bb01af-ee46-4483-982f-ef3921436a50\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;37bb01af-ee46-4483-982f-ef3921436...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;features&#x2F;2023-07-13&#x2F;ex-google-scientists-kickstarted-the-generative-ai-era-of-chatgpt-midjourney\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;features&#x2F;2023-07-13&#x2F;ex-goo...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ylecun&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770471957617836138\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ylecun&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770471957617836138</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lilianweng.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2018-06-24-attention&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lilianweng.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2018-06-24-attention&#x2F;</a>\n\n  This is an uncharitable and oddly dismissive take (i.e. perfect for HN, I suppose).<p>Today&#x27;s incredible state-of-the-art <i>does not exist without the transformer architecture.</i> Transformers aren&#x27;t merely some lucky passengers riding the coattails of compute scale. If they were, then the ChatGPT app which set the world ablaze would&#x27;ve instead been called ChatMLP, or ChatCNN. But it&#x27;s not. And in 2024 we <i>still</i> have no competing NLP architecture. Because the transformer is a genuinely profound, remarkable idea with remarkable properties (e.g. training parallelism). It&#x27;s easy to downplay GPTs as a mostly derivative idea with the benefit of hindsight. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll perform the same revisionist history with state-space models, or whatever architecture eventually supplants transformers. Do GPTs build on prior work? Do other approaches and ideas deserve recognition? Yeah, obviously. Like...welcome to science. But the transformer&#x27;s architects earned their praise -- including via this article -- which isn&#x27;t some slight against everyone else, as if accolades were a zero-sum game. These 8 people changed our world and genuinely deserve the love!\n\n    Question for you, as someone relatively new to the world of AI (well, not exactly new - I took many courses in AI, including neural networks, but in the late 90s... the world is just a tad different now!)<p>Is there any good summary of the history of AI&#x2F;deep learning from, say, late 00s&#x2F;2010 to the present? I think learning some of this history would really help be better understand how we ended up at the current state of the art.\n\n      I&#x27;ve been following a data science course called &quot;The Data Science Course 2023: Complete Data Science Bootcamp&quot; at Udemy.<p>The course starts all the way back from basic statistics and goes through things like linear regression and supposedly will arrive at neural networks and machine learning at some point.<p>So I don&#x27;t know if something like this is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for, but I think that, in general, if one wants to learn about (the history) AI, then it might be a good idea to start from statistics and learn about how we got from statistics to where we are now.\n\n      Not sure if this is wayy to off of what you ask: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OFS90-FX6pg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OFS90-FX6pg</a>\n\n      Maybe this? <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2212.11279\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2212.11279</a>\n\n      The worlds I see by fei fei li is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for, intertwined with a beautiful story of a brilliant scientist&#x27;s perseverance\n\n    &gt; And in 2024 we still have no competing NLP architecture.<p>No, we do. State space models are both faster and scale just as well. E.g., RWKV and Mamba.<p>&gt; Transformers aren&#x27;t merely some lucky passengers riding the coattails of compute scale.<p>Err... they are, though. They were just the type of model the right researchers were already using at the time, probably for translating between natural languages.\n\n    It’s reply’s like this that make HN a good place.\n\n  They didn’t invent it, they advanced it. I agree.<p>However, some advances can have huge consequences to the field compared to others, even if at the technical level they appear comparable.<p>One example that comes to mind is CRISPR.\n\n&gt; Not only were the authors all Google employees, they also worked out of the same offices.<p>Subtle plug for return-to-office. In-person face-to-face collaboration (with periods of solo uninterrupted deep focus) probably is the best technology we have for innovation.\n\n  &gt; with periods of solo uninterrupted deep focus<p>Which is usually impossible in the office. So more like a mix, which is what all reasonable people are saying.\n\n  +1. I worked remotely the past 2 years. I just RTO&#x27;d (new team) and it&#x27;s life-changing when you actually want to get stuff done quickly.\n\n  “Office” does not have to mean open office. Academics all have offices with doors for a reason. I can’t stand open office, but private office in a building with other people is great.\n\n  Not so subtle!\n\nThis &#x27;conversation&#x27; with Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li goes over a lot of the history of things (1h50m):<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QWWgr2rN45o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QWWgr2rN45o</a><p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E14IsFbAbpI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E14IsFbAbpI</a>  (&#x27;mirror&#x27;)<p>Goes over Hinton&#x27;s history and why he went the direction he did with his research, as well as Li&#x27;s efforts with ImageNet.\n\nIt&#x27;s pretty cool that Google employees can see the first transformer implementation (and the reviewer comments) in cs&#x2F;.<p>So many monumental moments in AI history are archived in Google&#x27;s intranet.\n\nIt&#x27;s amazing how much industry changed CS in the last decade. Significantly more than Academia. Resources is part of it of course, but I also think that the majority of best people in CS choose research labs in industry over academia. No surprise here of course - if openai offers you more than $500K a year, why would you go to academia, make peanuts in comparison and worry about politics for your tenure? Then when they get bored at big tech they raise money and start a company.\n\nGoogle is an Ads company ad the end of the day. They are making 10% revenue from GCloud but still bulk of their profits are from Ads.<p>If they were threatened, Google could have easily owned the cloud. They were the first to a million servers and exabyte storage scale. Their internal infra is top notch.<p>Under no circumstances can they damage their cash cow. They have already shown to be UX hostile by making Ads look like results, and Youtube forcing more ads onto users.<p>The biggest breakthrough an AI researcher can have at Google is to get more ad clicks across their empire.<p>Google management knows this. Without ad revenue, they are fucked.<p>That is my biggest fear. That with AI we are able to exploit the human mind for dopamine addiction through screens.<p>Meta has shown that their algorithm can make the feeds more addictive (higher engagement). This results in more ads.<p>With Insta Reels, Youtube, TikTok e.t.c &quot;Digital Heroin&quot; keeps on getting better year after year.\n\nI&#x27;m getting tired of the &quot;Google employee who created X&quot;. There is so much prior art it makes me roll my eyes when I see these posts.\n\n&gt; The group is also culturally diverse. Six of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively.<p>As much as I think the America has lot of things it needs to fix, there is no other country on earth this would be possible. That&#x27;s just a fact.\n\n  &gt; there is no other country on earth this would be possible. That&#x27;s just a fact<p>I don’t think this the case. If anything the US makes life very hard for even high-skilled work-based immigrants. Many countries have a higher % of foreign born residents than the US (Singapore, Australia, Germany, Canada)<p>I myself used to work at Google UK and my own team was 100% foreign born engineers from every continent.\n\n  I agree. As someone who has lived or worked in Asia, Europe, and the US, I always had the most diverse group of colleagues in the US."

      "conversation_text": "So, is this why fasting sometimes seems like a solution?<p>Edit:\nOversimplified, but: Less, calories, less fat?  Excess calories, more fat?\n\n  You should word this better. But I think Fasting helps because of autophagy, I don&#x27;t think these are exactly related. I thought autophagy takes out proteins too.\n\n  Fasting seems like a solution because in the fasted state your body doesn&#x27;t need to produce insulin. Your body needs insulin to push fat into cells. Your pancreas gets a break, and perhaps sensitivity improves when you go on an extended insulin-free holiday.\n\n    Except there&#x27;s literally a result out this week linking fasting (specifically 16+ hour intermittent fasting) with a 91% increase in cardiovascular disease deaths, which if it holds up would utterly swamp any incremental improvements to alzheimers risk.<p>No free lunch in personal health decisions, alas.  Really the only good advice is stick to well-established science, be healthy in general, avoid internet advice, and don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff.\n\n      The results unfortunately are too vague to support that interpretation.<p>There was no causal linkage because they couldn&#x27;t determine why people were fasting: suppressed appetite due to illness, suppressed appetite due to being a smoker (which is very common), skipping meals due to poverty.<p>It also found that while cardiovascular deaths increased by 91% overall deaths were completely unchanged...which is a bit difficult to reconcile.\n\n        &gt; The results unfortunately are too vague to support that interpretation.<p>I think you completely missed the point.  Sure, it&#x27;s a new result and being an outlier needs to be treated with care (which I believe I said).  It&#x27;s <i>still</i> a more rigorous finding of health effect than anything in the grandparent&#x27;s comment about how you should fast to avoid Alzheimer&#x27;s.  Ergo advice like that is bad.\n\n      Thank You<p>It seems counterintuitive, and opposite of what is promoted.<p>I&#x27;ll have to check it out more.<p>But from AHA, this is enough of a dramatic result to at least follow up on.<p>8-hour time-restricted eating linked to a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsroom.heart.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsroom.heart.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;8-hour-time-restricted-eatin...</a>\n\n    I&#x27;m no biologist but it&#x27;s my understanding that insulin causes cells take up glucose, not fats. And I don&#x27;t see anyone suggesting insulin or the pancreas is involved in any of this. So what does the pancreas have to do with Alzheimers?\n\n      &gt; I don&#x27;t see anyone suggesting<p>Have you looked?<p>&quot;Although many factors affect fat cells, the hormone insulin exerts dominant anabolic control. Insulin decreases the circulating concentration of all major metabolic fuels by stimulating glucose uptake into tissues, suppressing release of fatty acids from adipose tissue, inhibiting production of ketones in the liver, and promoting fat and glycogen deposition.&quot;\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6082688&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6082688&#x2F;</a><p>Or this one: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nih.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;nih-study-shows-how-insulin-stimulates-fat-cells-take-glucose\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nih.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;nih-study-show...</a><p>There are many many other studies and articles, as the insulin-fat storage connection is very well documented\n\n      It depends what cells we&#x27;re talking about. Thanks to insulin, glucose can be stored in the liver and muscle tissues as glycogen. In folks with poor insulin sensitivity these cells do not respond as effectively to insulin, and their uptake and storage is reduced, leaving more glucose in the bloodstream. In the obese, it&#x27;s also likely the liver and muscle tissue glycogen stores are near max capacity. In this case insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose into adipose (fat) tissue through a process known as lipogenesis. When I wrote &quot;insulin pushes fat into cells&quot; that&#x27;s what I meant.\n\n    The insulin protein promotes <i>glucose</i> (not fats) uptake into the muscles (~75%), liver (~15%), and other tissue (~10%) to aggressively lower blood sugar levels back to a total circulating amount of ~5g.\n\n      In the obese, glucose is preferentially directed to adipose tissue for storage as fat. This is due to both insulin resistance, and to the limited storage capacity in muscles and the liver for glucose in the form of glycogen. I was writing colloquially and intentionally left out details like lipogenesis, which in retrospect probably wasn&#x27;t a great idea.\n\n  In addition to weight loss, fasting can reduce activated microglia in the brain which could play some part in this, as microglia was mentioned in the study.\n\n  As per the Nature paper, this is an immune system mechanism with these particular “fat” particles presumed to help fend off an invading microbe. So no, it doesn’t matter how much fat or not you have to begin with as you cannot as easily reduce the immune system ability to do its work, and even if you did somehow manage to stop this particular immune response it is far from clear if you would get more or less dementia as a result.\n\ntl;dr no one knows, lots of hints but every attempt at chemical intervention turns out to be worthless\n\n  The latest approved Alzheimer’s drug, Lecanemab, shows a cognitive benefit. It’s modest, but there are already successors in the pipeline that have shown promise (e.g. donanemab). They’re baby steps, not at all cures, and have significant side effects, but “everything we try doesn’t work at all” isn’t really true the way it was even a few years ago.\n\n  As with everything else unknown, no one knows <i>yet</i>.<p>Remember that only 100 years ago you could die from an infection.\n\nDoesn&#x27;t this boost the hypothesis that Alzheimer&#x27;s is closely related to insulin resistance in the brain? What some people call type III diabetes.<p>I ask because one of the hallmarks of insulin resistance is the presence of lipid droplets in close proximity to mitochondria [0].<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC10455923&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC10455923&#x2F;</a>\n\n  Here&#x27;s what the authors speculate [1],<p>&gt; A recent report showed that innate immune triggers (for example, Escherichia coli and Salmonella) induce LD formation in peripheral macrophages as part of an evolutionarily conserved antimicrobial defence in which LDs coated with antimicrobial proteins, such as cathelicidin (CAMP), kill bacteria8. We speculate that a similar programme can be triggered in human microglia exposed to Aβ, LPS and other innate immune activators and disrupt brain homeostasis. Protein aggregates found in other neurodegenerative diseases may trigger the LDAM state. For example, alpha-synuclein binding to TLR2 and TLR5 induces microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is a shared signature seen in LDAM36. Given that we recently identified that LDAM are abundant in the ageing mouse brain, LDAMs may also be triggered by hitherto unknown protein aggregates and innate immune activators which accumulate with age. Interestingly, the most enriched pathway in human LD-containing iMGs is ‘cellular senescence’, similar to lipid-laden ‘foamy macrophages’ in atherosclerosis which have a senescent phenotype and are drivers of pathology37. Perhaps in the natural ageing of various organs, LD-accumulating tissue-resident macrophages represent a general class of senescent myeloid cells which are drivers of tissue inflammation.<p>It could be a lot of things, and there might be multiple pathways that lead to this state.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07185-7#Sec6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07185-7#Sec6</a>\n\n  sleep problems (like sleep apnea) affect insulin resistance and weight gain.  This goes with other evidence that not sleeping correlates with alzheimers.  So the fat buildup correlates in a different way.\n\n  There&#x27;s a really interesting paradox where, compared to healthy adults, intramuscular lipid droplet storage near mitochondria is increased in:  \n1) People with obesity\n2) People with type 2 diabetes\n3) People who do endurance exercise<p>Even though #3 is highly protective against #1 and #2. The best explanation I&#x27;ve seen is that the important difference is <i>why</i> the lipid droplets are being deposited [1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00424-005-1509-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00424-005-1509-0</a>\n\n    If I am rich enough to have a down payment for a Bay Area house I’ll be tremendously in debt. But that wouldn’t put me in the same boat as someone with oodles of credit card debt.<p>I’m guessing in endurance athletes it’s there because it’s about to be used. In the obese it’s there because they’re running out of places to put fat.\n\n      Right - but even then, if a super fit endurance athlete stops exercising, they don&#x27;t immediately become diabetic. The upstream cause (what biochemical stimulus is driving the fat deposition?) is probably where the key insight lies.\n\n        Well yeah. You’re measuring the output to a multi-variate function. There should be no expectation that this one output drives other occasionally correlated outputs to other functions.\n\n        If I recall correctly there were some studies that actually showed endurance runners have higher type 2 diabetes risk. And the suspect cause was the diet, specifically the carb loading practice and the abuse of high sugar products during the activity. So the three categories may actually share the same baseline, insulin resistance. It was quite controversial when it emerged (see Tim Noakes story), not sure if it&#x27;s more accepted these days.\n\n          This is very interesting to a diabetic like myself, who is slightly underweight.<p>I&#x27;ve even had some people tell me I can&#x27;t be diabetic because I don&#x27;t have much, if any, extra fat.\n\n    Doesn’t diabetes mean that the cells has to extract more energy from those lipid droplets instead of from the glucose pathway impacted by the diabetes? Thus in the cases of 2 and 3 those droplets is an additional significant source of energy.<p>I also think that in the case of 1 the cells may be starving on glucose pathways (pre-diabetes), similar to 3 during the exercise and to 2 in regular situation, and that causes the over-eating while all that food doesn’t feed the cells because of the original issue and thus goes into fat for storage and into the lipid droplets way of feeding the cells to workaround the original glucose pathway issue.\n\n  If it does boost that hypothesis, what then? Are there things you can do aside from the basic focus on diet, exercise, and sleep?\n\n    I assume: avoid sugar.\n\n      I think that would be covered by focus on diet and sleep.\n\n    <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brainenergy.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brainenergy.com&#x2F;</a><p>Highly recommend. I think is what you are looking for.\n\n    If this proves out we focus on finding the precise mechanism and how to disrupt it.\n\n    Peptides.\n\n  Plausible. I think this was also addressed in the work of Christopher Palmer.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brainenergy.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brainenergy.com&#x2F;</a><p>“Mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain”\n\n    All of them?\n\n      Why would this be shocking?\n\n        I wouldn&#x27;t call it metabolic if parts were missing or otherwise had communication malfunctions without any issue in acquiring&#x2F;using energy itself.<p>But I&#x27;m sure lots of things go wrong when the brain doesn&#x27;t get the energy it needs and is forced to compensate.<p>Even more to the point: If something generalizes without a qualifier like most&#x2F;many&#x2F;some&#x2F;can be, there might be an implicit &quot;all&#x2F;every&quot; (or careless communication) and that makes it all suspect.\n\n  I am swallowing berberine now.<p>Many studies show that berberine can significantly lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes ( 8 ). It seems to work via multiple mechanisms and may help ( 9 , 10 ): decrease insulin resistance, making the blood sugar-lowering hormone insulin more effective.\n\nI suggest changing the title to something like: &quot;Link Between Brain Cell Fat and Alzheimer’s Could Pave the Way for Innovative Treatments&quot;. Also here is the original Nature journal reference that can be linked to instead: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07185-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07185-7</a>\n\nMy aunt started showing symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s. My grandfather passed from it. Is there any thing to do in order to prevent or delay the disease?\n\n  First it would be good to know if you have genetic predisposition. I think mosts comercial DNA tests available test for APOE4 variations.<p>Second I would read on the research of Dr. Dale Bredesen. He has been studying how to map all the underlying factors that can lead to Alzheimer and how to test&#x2F;treat markers that are associated with the disease.<p>According to him Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is like a roof full of holes. You need to test and treat each individual hole to make sure it&#x27;s not leaking.\n\n    This is good advice. Be aware that while APOE variants are the most well known and common causes of a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s, there are several others, including some 100% penetrance, dominant gene mutations that cause it. Unfortunately I have very significant experience with one of these. Generally it would be common enough in your family (roughly 50% of people getting it), that you’d have reason to suspect one of these gene mutations.\n\n    Even if Dr Bredesen is misdiagnosing the causes of Alzheimer&#x27;s, his recommendations are still just the basics of healthy living. Like exercise, getting enough sleep, good dental hygiene, etc.\n\n  Leqembi is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying agent. There are a few others that delay the progression of dementia by about 6 months.\n\n  This is a shot in the dark.<p>My dad passed from dementia. That’s the best diagnosis we got. He wouldn’t go in under an MRI machine.<p>He had horrible , infected teeth.  They were badly infected.<p>There’s linkage of poor oral hygiene and Alzheimer’s.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;mind-and-mood&#x2F;good-oral-health-may-help-protect-against-alzheimers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;mind-and-mood&#x2F;good-oral-healt...</a><p>If I had know this sooner, I would have pushed harder for him to have those bad teeth extracted and had him start using a water pik.<p>I worry that what he died of was preventable.\n\n    Could the consumption of too many carbohydrates have led to your dad&#x27;s teeth issues?\n\n    I&#x27;m not sure blaming yourself for this situation is healthy. You might want to talk through this with a professional.\n\n  &gt; My aunt started showing symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s. My grandfather passed from it. Is there any thing to do in order to prevent or delay the disease?<p>Similar to ASCVD it takes decades to manifest and lots of the traditionally healthy lifestyle activities help delay or prevent it (diet, sleep, exercise). Unfortunately once someone is showing symptoms it&#x27;s very late in the game.\n\n    I try to follow that lifestyle and push my mom and dad to it, they both workout and exercise. I don&#x27;t think they work their brain that much though. I&#x27;ve been pushing them to take a course or something like that.\n\n  Vaccines. Many of them, seemingly unrelated. Not to delay, but to prevent. I wonder how that links in with this finding.\n\n  There was a paper years ago saying in some Autopsies they found signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s being &#x27;repaired&#x27; in people who stayed mentally active. Anecdotally the people in my family that had it stopped engaging their brains in deep ways before it happened. Surely that&#x27;s no silver bullet or everyone would do it, but thought I&#x27;d share\n\n+1 for GLP1\n\n  Do GLP1 agents go through the brain blood barrier?\n\n    they could help prevent the occurrence\n\n    GLP1 analogs can cross the blood–brain barrier and stimulate the GLP1 receptor in the brain.[1]<p>There is also research showing improvement in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease symptoms.

Suspicion is warranted, though signs of errors and fraud require even deeper investigation.\n\nPaul Saladino has been saying this for over 5 years but people ignore him because he&#x27;s often shirtless and eats lots of protein.\n\n  A broken clock is right two times a day.\n\n    A <i>stopped</i> clock is right twice a day. A broken clock could potentially never be right, like if it&#x27;s perpetually 10 minutes behind.\n\n      That&#x27;s not a broken clock, that&#x27;s a clock that&#x27;s set to the wrong time. Unless it remains 10 minutes behind, even when you set it 10 minutes forward, which would be a great prank gift.\n\n        A broken analogy never stops.\n\n  Paul Saladino says a lot of things. Which of his claims are you specifically referencing here?\n\n    About fat accumulation and decades of chronic inflammation in the brain being huge factors for Alzheimer&#x27;s.\n\n      I couldn&#x27;t find any example of him claiming anything related to fat accumulation in the brain. Could you link to an example or copy&#x2F;paste a quote that you&#x27;re referring to?\n\n  Paul Saladino has been saying that APOE4&#x2F;4 is linked to damaging lipid droplets in Alzheimer’s disease microglia?\n\n    Are you being serious?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=b6nZKkrWoas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=b6nZKkrWoas</a>\n\nAs a former Alzheimer&#x27;s researcher, this is a big fucking deal. It puts together a lot of clues (APOE risk, microglia) and finds a theory that makes a lot of sense. All around the world, there are labs pulling late nights trying to figure out how to drug this.\n\n  Are you aware of any other studies that support this theory? In other words, is this replicable?\n\n  What kind of fat is it? Like is it possible to avoid by avoiding too much fat?\n\n    Too early to know for sure but I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s very unlikely, the relationship between diet and body composition is rarely so straight forward.\n\n    The idea that eating fat leads to higher body fat is the most dangerously-wrong health misconception in history.\n\n      &gt;&gt; The idea that eating fat leads to higher body fat is the most dangerously-wrong health misconception in history.<p>Modern equivalent of medieval leeches and enemas for &quot;fever&quot; (almost anything was called a &#x27;fever&#x27; back then) and eating goat testicles for potency. Eating them raw obviously :)\n\n        Medical leeches are still very much a thing. They’re used to help improve venous circulation after plastic surgery around reattached body parts, help with burn recovery, etc\n\n      Honest question: how? I&#x27;ve never seen anyone who&#x27;s obese and having a diet that made me go &quot;huh that&#x27;s odd how can they be obese?&quot;<p>While the inverse occasionally has been true, generally people who I consider in good shape appear to eat less, and less greasy food.<p>So while there might be exceptions it seems  to be a damn good rule of thumb to me.\n\n        Just guessing as to the parent comments meaning.<p>But I suppose that plenty of fats are healthy and part of a balanced diet. And someone who eats nothing but refined sugar is more likely to be over weight that someone with a high % of fat in their diet.\n\n          I think you&#x27;re right<p>The danger is two fold<p>1. People don&#x27;t eat fatty foods which have solid evidence for their benefits (e.g. Virgin olive oil)<p>2. People substitute the lack of fats with sugar, which I believe (not an expert) has a lot literature linking it with obesity\n\n        &gt; I&#x27;ve never seen anyone who&#x27;s obese and having a diet that made me go &quot;huh that&#x27;s odd how can they be obese?&quot;<p>Your question isn&#x27;t refuting OPs claim: the people you are observing to be fat are fat because of their carb&#x2F;sugar intake, not fat.<p>i.e. if you just fed someone large amounts of protein and fat they would be lean; it is the sugar and carbs that make them fat.\n\n          No they wouldn’t stay lean. If you fed someone more calories than their body uses to maintain its current weight, they would get fat eventually. Regardless of whether they eat carbs, fat or protein.\n\n            Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re being fed just the amount of calories your body needs to maintain. What influence on body fat has the distribution of carbs, protein and fat from food then?\n\n              My point was that regardless of what you eat, if you eat more than your body expends, some of the excess will be used to produce fat and you will gain weight. If you lead a sedentary lifestyle and eat 3000 calories of nothing but lean meat per day, you will gain weight.<p>You are right that different foods (macronutrients, more specifically) have different thermic effects and therefore require different amounts of energy to metabolise. Protein takes more energy to process than fat. This does not change my overall point.\n\n              Not much for getting lean but it&#x27;s easier to overeat carbs and fats are calorie dense. That said you need to eat a mix of the three to be healthy because they all have important body functions.\n\n            You&#x27;re so wrong. With only protein and fat, they would not be able to gain much weight. I&#x27;ve tried to gain weight on low carb&#x2F;high fat, and it doesn&#x27;t work. I was uncomfortably full after every meal. My tracking showed a significant calorie surplus, but my body wasn&#x27;t absorbing it. Adding in more carbs made a huge difference. Hormones tell your body when to store fat.\n\n              Did you know that bodybuilders in the 1950&#x27;s(before anabolic steroids) used the egg and steak diet before contests as cutting diet to get lean? They would eat, as the name suggests, large quantities of steak and eggs with butter and have a carb refeeding day every 4 days. They would get really lean on a very high-calorie diet, think 4000 to 6000 calories.<p>The inventor of diet famously lost a contest for being too lean.\n\n            Lack of carbs supresses appetite, JFYI.\n\n              I never claimed otherwise and it does not negate my point.\n\n          Humans are bad at lipogenesis: we can only convert tiny fraction of the carbs into fat. Thus: the fat your eat is largely the fat you wear.<p>You cannot explain it otherwise (without showing a undiscoverd way humans can convert carbs into fat).<p>&gt; i.e. if you just fed someone large amounts of protein and fat they would be lean; it is the sugar and carbs that make them fat.<p>This is dangerous. It may work on the short term, but it is very dangerous on the long run.\n\n            High fat and protein is keto right? What&#x27;s so dangerous?\n\n              Ketosis is probably our rudimentary &quot;wintersleep mode&quot;. Rudimentary as we are basically tropical animals (look at our lack of fur).<p>We should not eat for ketosis. But we can eat (restricted to fat and protein) and still stay in ketosis, which is marketed as the keto diet and is not well tested in long term studies. You are a guinea pig when you do this long term.\n\n                &gt;You are a guinea pig when you do this long term.<p>As opposed to being reliably obese? What&#x27;s your baseline? I recently checked the average weight of men and women and I am honestly shocked.\n\n                  Short term you can lose weight with ketosis. Long term you are taking unknown risks.<p>The risks of obesity are well known. Also, you do not get obese by lack of a keto diet. One usually gets there with a rubbish diet.\n\n                    For me I went keto because I had a problem with sugar addiction going back since childhood. I managed to maintain a healthy weight through exercise etc but as I aged I felt that my bodies ability to handle sugar was decreasing, and it had significant impact on my energy levels, physical appearance and digestion.<p>Keto not only simplified my diet but massively improved my digestion, and helped me form more awareness of risks of sugar.<p>Regarding no long term studies..  its hard to believe much these days I rely on body feedback. Years ago the American diet was supposed to be healthy, look how that science turned out.\n\n                      I&#x27;m glad it works for you. I&#x27;m not keto hating, I just find people advising to do it long term to be on the quacky side (there simply is no such evidence).<p>&gt;  Years ago the American diet was supposed to be healthy<p>The result of lobbying. True nutrition experts knew all along.\n\n            &gt; Humans are bad at lipogenesis: we can only convert tiny fraction of the carbs into fat.<p>Because historically food is scarce or difficult to obtain, in general organisms develop mechanisms to make good use of it: when excess food (&quot;energy&quot;) is available, it is stored rather than wasted.<p>This is also true in particular for mammals, and for humans. It&#x27;s quite obvious that humans are very effective at storing excess energy.<p>It is said that sumo fighters maintain their body mass (muscle + lots of fat) by eating rice (i.e. carbohydrates) and protein.<p>Lipogenesis (fat generation from carbohydrates) takes place mostly in the liver.\n&quot;Excess acetyl CoA generated from excess glucose or carbohydrate ingestion can be used for fatty acid synthesis or lipogenesis.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;courses.lumenlearning.com&#x2F;suny-ap2&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;lipid-metabolism&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;courses.lumenlearning.com&#x2F;suny-ap2&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;lipid-met...</a><p>The conclusion being: &quot;Humans are great at lipogenesis. That&#x27;s how we store excess energy.&quot;\n\n              Nope. If humans eat both carbs and fat (most of us do), the excess calories of fat goes mainly into the storage (or plaques to your arteries), while the carbs are used in the sort term (converted into glucose).<p>&gt; Lipogenesis is mostly derived from carbohydrates and is a relatively minor contributor to whole-body lipid stores, contributing 1–3% of the total fat balance in humans consuming a typical diet.<p>From:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;agricultural-and-biological-sciences&#x2F;lipogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;agricultural-and-biolog...</a><p>Believe what you will. &quot;It is said&quot; wrt sumo fighters does not sound very scientific.\n\n                The human body doesn&#x27;t need to store excess calories. It could store the excess calories or it can excrete energy through urine(glucose, ketones)\nOr it can ramp up metabolism, there are many scenarios. Not all lead to adipose tissue growth. Why not muscle growth, which is somehow always overlooked in these discussions.<p>Funny enough adipose tissue and muscle growth are both through hormones. If testorone and hgh are high then muscles growth will prioritised over adipose tissue.<p>People with type 1 diabetes have figured out how to stay thin after eating copious amounts[0]. They won&#x27;t inject themselves with insulin. Unhealthy, sure, but they won&#x27;t store calories, as adipose tissue (fat cells) remain inactive, even though blood glucose is dangerously high.<p>Just looking at calories is simplification, and is just for general guidance.<p>[0]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.clevelandclinic.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;diseases&#x2F;22658-diabulimia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.clevelandclinic.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;diseases&#x2F;22658-diabuli...</a>\n\n            Why would a mammal&#x27;s body evolved to use fat cells to store and utilise lipids for energy?<p>Plants have carbs in starch.

Lowering cholesterol and fat in diet needs to be done in consultation with somebody who understands your metabolism. Some vitamins are fat soluble. Some fat is beneficial.<p>Homeostasis is amazing.\n\n          While I always knew that sugars where the main culprit for body fat thanks to a highschool biology class, I have never understood why fat is less of a problem so thank you. Could you link me with sources or search keyword in order to know more of what the body is doing with excess fat ?\n\n            I tried &quot;what does the body do with excess fat&quot; and I think it covers it. For sure, you get higher triglycerides floating around in the bloodstream, and the liver is under stress. at the extreme end, its Steatorrhea which is .. unpleasant (olestra goes to the same place)<p>The lymphatic system is also involved.<p>So it&#x27;s not entirely &quot;eat as much fat as you like&quot; by any stretch. It&#x27;s more that over time, the body tends back to a baseline model. Continual high levels of fat which cause surplus in the bloodstream are heading to arterial blockage and isn&#x27;t good, but the relationship of fat ingested to fats in the blood is a more complex path. &quot;it depends&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not a bio scientist or a med. Happy to be corrected.\n\n        &quot;Being fat&quot; and having too much fat (or the wrong kind of fat) in the blood or brain are not equivalent. Eg people with high cholesterol can be quite slim also.\n\n        &gt; I&#x27;ve never seen anyone who&#x27;s obese and having a diet that made me go &quot;huh that&#x27;s odd how can they be obese?&quot;<p>Are they eating fat _or sugar?_ The body will aggressively squirrel away any unused sugar as fat. As one example, a Big Mac contains 7g of _added_ sugar. Fries? Coated in dextrose. Sugar is added to damn-near everything.\n\n          &quot;Starch and glucose efficiently stimulate insulin secretion, and that accelerates the disposition of glucose, activating its conversion to glycogen and fat, as well as its oxidation. Fructose inhibits the stimulation of insulin by glucose, so this means that eating ordinary sugar, sucrose (a disaccharide, consisting of glucose and fructose), in place of starch, will reduce the tendency to store fat. Eating “complex carbohydrates,” rather than sugars, is a reasonable way to promote obesity. Eating starch, by increasing insulin and lowering the blood sugar, stimulates the appetite, causing a person to eat more, so the effect on fat production becomes much larger than when equal amounts of sugar and starch are eaten&quot;\nFrom <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raypeat.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;articles&#x2F;glycemia.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raypeat.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;articles&#x2F;glycemia.shtml</a>\n\n          Where I live, there&#x27;s only one beer brand that does not have glucose syrup. Sad.\n\n        People get fat through consuming more calories than they burn for energy during the day. There are extra but around the edges but no matter the ratio of fat to carbs to protein, if someone consumes (food or liquid) 3,000 calories a day but only burns 2,500 calories a day then a decent portion of that 500 cal difference will get stored as body fat. You could eat 0 calories of fat but if that total of carbs and protein is over your energy burn then over time you will add body fat.<p>I believe most people gain excess body fat through eating a little bit more than they need each day and then two or three weeks a year they eat and drink much more (holiday, Xmas, birthday etc), rather than consuming vast amounts of food day in day out of the wrong macro nutrient make up.\n\n          The calorie hypothesis isn&#x27;t the most likely from all the research I&#x27;ve done. The calorie as a unit of measure doesn&#x27;t even make much sense IMO.<p>A calorie is measured by burning food a specific distance away from a specific amount of water and measuring how much the water temperature rises. It&#x27;s based on an assumption that the body uses all energy in the food the same, and that fire is analogous to the complex process from digestion to energy use in the cell. The calorie as a measure effectively equates the body to a coal power plant.\n\n            Which the body basically is.<p>Anyone who tracks their calories daily for a long period of time will see that when they eat more they gain weight, when they eat less they loose weight.<p>Like I said above, there are other aspects that can factor but “calories in calories out” accounts for 80% of weight loss and weight gain (applying the broad brush of the 80:20 rule)\n\n              &gt; “calories in calories out” accounts for 80% of weight loss and weight gain<p>That is simply not true for people that are already obese.\n\n              If a calorie is a calorie, would you agree that I would be just as well of eating 1800 calories of fat rather than a balanced diet? Could I stick to 1800 calories of gasoline?<p>We can&#x27;t simply burn food and deem that an accurate analog to how the body processes and utilizes different food. Ask anyone that live(d) primarily on rabbit meat.<p>And to be clear, the 80:20 rule is am extremely broad and inaccurate rule of thumb that isn&#x27;t useful when applied to something specific. You can&#x27;t claim that calories in equals 80% of calories out because Paredo.\n\n          But it does depend on the type of foods. For example, let&#x27;s take a serving of almonds listed at 160 calories. Your body may only absorb 120 (depends on the person) of those calories to be burned due to the fiber in the almonds.  While foods with sugar and little fiber, you get close to 100% of the listed calories.\n\n            Sure, and that kind of thing falls into the 20% of the 80:20 rule of most things. The vast majority of people loose or gain weight based on their calorie in take &#x2F; expenditure\n\n            This is counter to the point that was made regarding fat. The almonds have a higher ratio of fat to other macros.\n\n        Your body can&#x27;t take fat from plants and animals and directly embed it into fat calls. The metabolism of ingested fat takes much more steps than say sugar, which can be directly absorbed into fat cells and also raises insulin resistance. Sugar and refined carbohydrates are a far bigger reason for obesity than fat consumption or &quot;greasy food&quot;.\n\n      We&#x27;ve probably done more harm with the similar, and also incorrect, assumption that eating more saturated fats go directly to the blood and clog arteries.\n\n        Can you point to some evidence that increased saturated fat consumption does not increase LDL? Or that there is no link between serum LDL levels and plaque build up? Or are you making a different claim?\n\n          Dr Michael Eades is a good gateway toif you&#x27;re interested. He wrote a book a while ago now titled Protein Power [1], I think he is working on an update&#x2F;sequel as well.<p>At the high level, my basic claim is that the idea that dietary saturated fat directly leads to heart attack is incorrect. The history of this claim dates back to President Eisenhower. After having a heart attack while in office he wanted to tell the public how he could avoid the same fate. Researchers cut corners to meet political targets, ignoring data that disproved their hypothesis and claimed that plaque found in cadaver arteries was made of saturated fats <i>and</i> that it got there due to the person&#x27;s diet.<p>The claims weren&#x27;t backed up by the studies used and we were told that this was now a known fact when it wasn&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve spent many decades since avoiding saturated fats in favor of unsaturated fats, which are highly oxidative and have concerning side effects when run through the Krebs Cycle.<p>Dr Eades also has a few interesting talks on the subject when he walks through the Krebs Cycle and the difference of saturated and unsaturated fats in case that&#x27;s helpful. I think [2] is one I watch years ago, though he has other similar talks on YouTube as well.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proteinpower.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proteinpower.com&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7MTNJNAZPiw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7MTNJNAZPiw</a>\n\n      There are exceptions, I have the APOE 4&#x2F;4 variant gene which results in my metabolism not dealing with saturated fat as well, and eating saturated fat does end up raising my bad cholesterol among a bunch of other terrible side effects<p>perhaps not coincidentally, this variant also comes with a higher risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease\n\n    Probably the combination of sugar and salt. The fats our body makes. Probably doing ketogenics and fasting reduces Alzheimer&#x27;s.\n\n    More likely we&#x27;ll need to start paying attention to sugar intake. I&#x27;ve heard researchers call Alzheimer as &quot;type 3 diabetes&quot;. This makes total sense to me since sugar consumption is a big driver of body fat accumalation.\n\n    Probably the opposite. Eating more &quot;good&quot; fat assuming you then have less sugar. Nuts, olive oils, omega-3s, etc.\n\n    Per the Nature paper, this fat is believed to be part of an immune system response and not related to your intake or total body fat. It is also far from clear that eliminating the production or use of this fat during a microbe invasion would lead to more or less dementia down the road (a good reminder that clinical trials are useful and also risky). This work shows a very refreshing and solid hypothesis and lots of people work on it, but it’s not reason to start changing diets.\n\n      Yeah, I almost wish I hadn’t asked given the comments. Really points at an interesting mechanism though. Hopefully this means some kind of preventative or even treatment is possible.\n\n  Can I ask you your thoughts about CYP21A2?<p>Been studying folks with only one working CYP21A2 due to the resulting atypical adrenal function and I noticed that their dna also contains all the genetic variants associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s (some are beneficial in this case). Inquiring about the family tree of the single CYP21A2 I have yet to have someone tell me of an ancestor that died of Alzheimer&#x27;s.  But the family members with two good CYP21A2 (and all of the other typical Alzheimer&#x27;s genetics) are the ones that end up with Alzheimer&#x27;s.  And for good measure, when someone has 3 CYP21A2 nearly always they will get Alzheimer&#x27;s. (they also end up with Hypercortisolism).<p>Subclinical Hypercortisolism has a long association with Alzheimer&#x27;s.  A deficient CYP21A2 and the decreased incidences of Alzheimer&#x27;s is not talked about other than the fact that it isn&#x27;t associated with Subclinical Hypercortisolism, but Subclinical Hypocortisolism instead.<p>All of the known indirect early preventative measures for Alzheimer&#x27;s result in shifting from Subclinical Hypercortisolism towards Subclinical Hypocortisolism.<p>This was not my intended area of study, but the pattern is interesting and curious for your thoughts.\n\n    I&#x27;m really uninformed about this topic, but I&#x27;ll second the request for info about this!<p>I have Alzheimer&#x27;s on three sides of my family (really banking on the fact that I take after the 4th grandmother who was sharp as a tack till 98), and while I haven&#x27;t ever looked into a diagnosis of hypercorticolism, thanks to very early (in utero&#x2F;neonate) trauma, my parasympathetic nervous system never learned how to <i>clear</i> cortisol like it should, which I&#x27;m working to remediate now.<p>I&#x27;ve been operating under the assumption that Alzheimer&#x27;s is a high risk in my future, but I&#x27;d love to know more about what any experts would say I could even <i>try</i> to do by lifestyle change or preventative treatment!\n\n      May I ask how you found out your nervous system has trouble clearing cortisol? Is there a test you can do? How are you remediating it?<p>I also have Alzheimer’s in the family and this hypercortisolism discussion feels familiar to me.\n\n      Assuming your psychological state of mind and your heart health is relatively good, whole body cold water plunges&#x2F;swimming 3 times a week for 2-3 minutes, has been shown (in relatively small studies) to have many positive effects on various endocrine system functions, including cortisol levels.\n\n        I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve seen the documentary &#x27;My Octopus Teacher&#x27;, but the subject spends an entire year diving in frigid water.  His voice and general presence are so peaceful, it&#x27;s almost comical.  I joked at the time I saw it that he must have no cortisol left.\n\n  &gt;  All around the world, there are labs pulling late nights trying to figure out how to drug this.<p>I dont know why, but I&#x27;ve been under the impression for years that it was fat build-up. I remember I saw images of alzheimer brains with clogged arteries.<p>Sure drugging would be nice, but why not figure out what in our modern diet and habits is responsible for this? Why not tell people that the insane amount of oils&#x2F;fats we consume (in comparison to our primate animal relatives) is killing us and&#x2F;or making us sick?\n\n    You are assuming this is a modern disease? Why?<p>Folks have had different sorts of dementia for centuries, though. We simply didn&#x27;t have the knowledge nor the tools to differentiate one from another and tended to call things by different names.<p>Not as many people die young now, either, so more folks are actually getting diseases that present in old age. You can&#x27;t observe many old folks if there aren&#x27;t any, and you won&#x27;t notice as many diseases that hit mostly women if a lot of women die in childbirth.<p>And a note: Food of yesteryear wasn&#x27;t really better&#x2F;healthier than now. It was different, more risky, and for most folks, was just made of whatever they happen to have and not very varied.\n\n      It&#x27;s not a modern disease, it simply has exploded in occurrence. This explosion is modern. This is likely due to our diet. There&#x27;s a book called &quot;the blue zones&quot; that dives into healthy diets and lifestyles that have historically helped people grow old.<p>&gt; Food of yesteryear wasn&#x27;t really better&#x2F;healthier than now.<p>Not all food was. But Okinawans do pretty well for a long, long time.\n\n        I’m not so convinced about “blue zones”. A lot of longevity claims seem to disappear once modern record keeping and birth certificates come into play.\n\n          Not aware of this. Any source you have?\n\n            Not sure where I originally heard this, but I just found this preprint: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;704080v3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;704080v3</a>\n\n  Ironically those late nights might contribute to Alzheimer&#x27;s risk ;)\n\n    Or. Apparently, not.\n\n  Silly question, but could this be aided by simply reducing body fat down to extremely low levels?\n\n    This is not a silly question, might be one of the most important questions for those of us who are going to live long enough.\n\n    Let&#x27;s not jump to interventions just yet because prolonged low body fat comes with it&#x27;s own set of serious health risks.\n\n    No. The brain is about 60% fat. It’s not about having fat in your brain, it’s about having AND amyloid plaques AND fat in specific locations AND probably a whole host of other factors.<p>Does eating healthy food instead of highly saturated fats provide health benefits? Yes. Does having too low levels of body fat lead to health problems? Also yes.\n\n  Perhaps a stupid question but why wasn&#x27;t this found earlier after examination of brain tissue?\n\n    I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;ve been reading lately that the plaque vector has been so well studied because it&#x27;s the only direction that has been able to get funding.  Conspiracy aside, this seems like a more common thing now - someone has a little bit of possible progress, and no one will give any money to any other thing, often at our detriment.\n\n  <i>&quot;Back when Alzheimer&#x27;s disease was first identified by Alois Alzheimer, he noted that in addition to the plaques and tau buildup, there was also a buildup of fat droplets in brain cells. Since that time, little effort has been made to determine whether they might be the cause of the disease.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not medical researcher but I find this statement incredible. It&#x27;s over 120 years since Alzheimer did this work. Why the fuck is it just becoming a big deal now? Surely this info was in the literature back then so why was it ignored and not followed up decades ago?<p>With Alzheimer&#x27;s we&#x27;ve witnessed over many decades seemingly any number research leads that have gotten nowhere and have ended up as dead ends yet it&#x27;s only now that we&#x27;re following up an ancient lead that should have been researched many decades ago.<p>As a lay onlooker, such revelations only further shake my faith in medical research. Every week there are many high profile PR announcements and research papers with the promise of major medical breakthroughs yet the vast percentage come to naught, or what&#x27;s reported is such a miniscule incremental step towards actual medical treatment that an effective treatment might not be realized for decades, if at all.<p>Why is medical research allowed to be hyped like this? Much of the reason why the public&#x27;s faith and trust in science is at an all-time low is the undeliverable hype from medical research. After decades of hyped promises  about cures and treatments which aren&#x27;t delivered or that fall short of the promise people no longer believe or researchers. People are just fed up with promises that aren&#x27;t delivered.<p>It&#x27;s not only research into Alzheimer&#x27;s that the public feels as having fallen short, it&#x27;s almost the full gamut. Take cancer research for instance, it&#x27;s been grossly over hyped for many decades.<p>Let me explain:<p>I recall as a child in the 195Os before starting school, my mother took me to a movie matinee, there was a main feature and newsreels. I clearly remember two of the newsreel stories, one was on rockets and warfare and the other about cancer research. After the matinee I ask my mother about cancer and so as not to worry me she said &quot;it&#x27;s a rare disease you&#x27;ll never have to worry about.&quot;<p>A couple of years later when I was about 7 or 8, we were on holidays at my grandmother&#x27;s place and I saw that her next-door neighbor was quite ill and my grandmother told me she was dying of cancer. That&#x27;s when I found out my mother had lied to me, and even at that age I was shocked and upset that she&#x27;d done so.<p>I&#x27;ve always remembered those incidents so ever since I&#x27;ve taken note of articles and reports about cancer in newspapers, popular science mags such as SciAm, New Scientist, and in professional journals such as Science and Nature, etc., and whilst I&#x27;ve not taken count, there has been many thousands of them over those many decades. Almost every one of these reports has made claims about &#x27;promising research&#x27; or a &#x27;possible cure&#x27; for cancer.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the facts, the vast majority of those reports and research papers has come to naught! As a guesstimate, I&#x27;d reckon that if the research in 0.1% of them had actually been positive and even partially successful and led to actual treatment that was effective then cancer would either be cured by now or at least a very manageable disease. Well, as we all know, that hasn&#x27;t happened by a long measure. Yes, some progress has been made but it&#x27;s a drop in the ocean, as about one third of the population <i>still</i> dies of cancer. No matter how one massages the stats that&#x27;s not success.<p>Fact is, whether it&#x27;s cancer, Alzheimer&#x27;s, drug research or other medical research, there&#x27;s a never ending stream of reports that promise much, much more than they ever deliver.<p>Another form of disingenuous hype in PR releases and medical research papers is that the title and abstract are often over hyped. Words like &#x27;significant&#x27; or &#x27;large improvements&#x27; are used when referring to some procedure or outcome. A full reading of the text shows the actual figure as low as 5% or so. In my opinion that verges on scientific fraud. It won&#x27;t fool any researcher who reads the paper but it will a newspaper editor who only reads the title and abstract (he&#x2F;she likely won&#x27;t understand the body text anyway). Right, the hype goes straight through to and misleads the public.<p>It&#x27;s time the medical industry \ntook away the rose-colored glasses and stopped the hype and bullshit about medical research.  It&#x27;s time medical researchers stopped publishing for the sake of it, or for career advancement, or to obtain increased funding.<p>Publishing substandard research or research that&#x27;s going to end up a dead end, or can&#x27;t result in treatments for decades is not only unethical but it&#x27;s unfair on those who are ill, it gives false hopes that come to nothing.<p>Finally, the quote above backs up what many of us lay people have thought for decades, which is that much medical research is either uncoordinated and or badly misdirected.\n\n    Medicine is hard. Unlike, say, physics, you cannot experiment on people except in very specific circumstances. Rats, mice, chimps etc. aren&#x27;t people, so researchers work on &quot;animal models&quot;, but in many cases you&#x27;re just giving lab rats an Alzheimer-like disease and curing them of an Alzheimer-like disease, which is nothing like curing actual Alzheimer in actual humans. (Yes, animal models often involve inducing a &quot;fake&quot; disease in animals — testing treatments for psoriasis involve giving imiquimod to genetically modified rats, for example. This activates some of the same immune pathways, but it ain&#x27;t psoriasis.) Alzheimer is particularly hard because we can&#x27;t really study what&#x27;s going on in the brain while people are alive, and when they&#x27;re dead and can be dissected, we can only see the remnants of that activity.<p>If science has been hyped up too much, I think we have the media to blame, not scientists. Media turns very early, pre-clinical, merely promising research into headlines like &quot;Could This Promising New Discovery Be a Cure For X?&quot; Meanwhile, tons of progress <i>is</i> being made; you probably just don&#x27;t notice it. Monoclonal antibodies (like Humira) for autoimmune disorders like Crohn&#x27;s, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, psoriasis, etc. have been complete game changers for people with autoimmune illnesses that involve the overexpression of certain cytokines like TNF. Same with JAK inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors. There are tons of things with good treatments now, but you probably don&#x27;t hear about them because it&#x27;s not that sexy and therefore not covered by media. As for cancer, it&#x27;s not a single, monolithic disease, but a whole lot of different ones (melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia etc. all have different causes). Huge leaps have been made with some (like melanoma), and for many cancers a lot more people are surviving than the 1950s when chemotherapy was in its infancy (methotrexate, the first chemo agent, was discovered in the late 40s) and most attempts to treat cancer involved surgery.\n\n  Do you know if water-only fasting is a good way and&#x2F;or necessary way to help stave off or even allow regression to occur?<p>An anti-inflammatory diet, inflammation being known as one of the ~5 root causes of Alzheimer&#x27;s for awhile now, like a ketogenic diet has been known to be beneficial - but water fasting will not only lower inflammation as much as possible, it will also arguably would cause more of the fat reserves to be used up - but whether that includes fat buildup in the brain too?\n\nGLP1 analogs could help. They can cross the blood–brain barrier and stimulate the GLP1 receptor in the brain.[1]<p>There is also research showing improvement in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease symptoms. [2]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;11931352&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;11931352&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S221287782100020X\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S221287782...</a>\n\n  GLP-1s definitely cross the blood-brain barrier - work by affecting the GABAergic CNS and making you not hungry so you stop eating and lose weight. They don&#x27;t independently do anything to make you slimmer. Basically what you&#x27;re suggesting is people lose weight, which, I agree.\n\nIs this correlated with obesity demographics, i.e. Japan&#x2F;US&#x2F;EU statistics? I can’t find reliable numbers per country, most sources conflate the different types into dementia.\n\nChatGPT already knows all this so it must be old news\n\nFatty cell infiltration occurs when the stem cell niches don&#x27;t fully convert into its end cell both Glia and Neuron. This would then indicate that TZDs can be effective in promoting the correct differentiation\n\nAnother theory is that Alzheimer&#x27;s is caused by the brain becoming insulin resistant. Some researchers even argue that Alzheimer&#x27;s should be called type 3 diabetes."

Whether or not it was an accomplishment for them or valve on a grand scale doesn’t matter, you folks don’t have to shit on it because it wasn’t mind blowing. I swear, nothing impresses hacker news commenters, Dropbox included.\n\n      It&#x27;s possible that if you don&#x27;t find it fun, it&#x27;s not for you.<p>I had fun reading about it; would probably have had fun doing it. No worries if that doesn&#x27;t match up!\n\n      people are paid assembling cars all the time\n\n      The writeup explicitly states it was fun:<p>&gt; This seems fun enough — and dumb enough — to try, so we got to work.<p>They then put it in their lobby because they thought it was cool.\n\n  As they write in the article: &quot;we wanted to shoot it practically (with actual cameras) to show off the new screen&quot;<p>Because VFX can show anything, a synthetic video tells you nothing about the actual brightness of the screen. Which was their whole point: &quot;Then, as we began to the see the new screens around the office, we were shocked. We knew we&#x27;d spec&#x27;d bright, OLED screens, but these things were EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT. Startlingly bright.&quot;\n\n  unlikely. They&#x27;d already created the prototype decks. They had the fabrication know-how in house. Sure they have in house VFX experience, but rigging the scene and trying to match lighting to reality and ultimately disappointing customers?  It&#x27;s a no brainer to use the real deal when you can.<p>Many would hire an agency to create an ad for you but that would 10x the cost, not to mention dealing with the opinions of an outsourced creative director...\n\nHonestly looks great. Liked the short videos, the one that shows the orb in After Effects with the cut of what goes into deck screen was also very interesting.<p>Ages ago I saw a work that was (I think) a piece of art that reused many phones for their screens to show things in sync. I don&#x27;t remember if they were early Android phones or if it was done before with screens of feature phones. But the work here reminded me of that.\n\nIf this seems familiar, this seems to be largely republishing a Fediverse thread that was originally posted back in November.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38240861\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38240861</a>\n\nSomewhat off-topic, but I&#x27;ve been feeling really burned by my steam deck purchase lately. When it came out, I gave Valve the benefit of the doubt there was some good reason why they weren&#x27;t providing an OLED option, and bought the highest tier even though money is tight. I figured their commitment to opening the PC platform and quality hardware earned them my trust on that. Now what am I supposed to do? Sell my model and take a bath on the used item depreciation to get a worthwhile screen? Buy a second device with pretty much identical performance otherwise? Pay for the screen I should have been able to choose separately and go through the headache of replacing it myself? This is tripping at the finish line, especially since I waited a massive fraction of the time it took them to release this for the inferior version anyway. I get Valve prides themselves on being different than most other technology companies, but innovating on what delivering the best product you can for the money to your customer means is the wrong place to break the mold, especially for a company of Valve&#x27;s profitability compared to overhead. On so many things, they could do much better at comparatively little dollar cost if they just thought wanting to was important. It&#x27;s really disappointing how much this has correlated with their success.\n\n  The original Steam Deck came out Feburary 2022 and the OLED model came out November 2023, nearly two years later.<p>&gt; This is tripping at the finish line<p>It sounds like the only person tripping here is you.\n\n    The original Steam Deck came out Feburary 2022 and the OLED model came out November 2023, nearly two years later, and I got my original Steam Deck nearly one year after giving Valve my money.\n\n      Is this verbal algebra?\n\n        How old are you?\n\n  &gt; Now what am I supposed to do?<p>I don’t know, maybe just live with your existing screen?<p>It’s not like it’s mandatory to have the latest version of something, and it’s pretty common for companies to iterate new versions with improvements.\n\n    &gt;Now what am I supposed to do? Sell my model and take a bath on the used item depreciation to get a worthwhile screen? Buy a second device with pretty much identical performance otherwise? Pay for the screen I should have been able to choose separately and go through the headache of replacing it myself?\n\n  I agree. When Intel released the i7, I was pretty upset they were holding out all that tech and left me stranded with my Pentium 4.\n\n    This is a mystifyingly bad comparison. Did Valve invent OLED? Did the Steam Deck release before that invention?\n\n  I get the FOMO, But I have the original steam deck too and it&#x27;s still great. Yes two years later something slightly better came out. No its nowhere nearly different enough for me to bother or be bothered. Technology changes but steam decks selling point was never that it would be bleeding edge technology (in fact there are many devices out with far higher specs) . It&#x27;s a well thought out ergonomic device with great ecosystem. And the killer feature for many is the flawless sleep system which is there in our og unit :). Hopefully you don&#x27;t end up too bummed out for too long that something slightly better came out two years later.\n\n  This comment doesn&#x27;t pass my Turing test\n\n    ?\n\n  Yes, indeed, once you, specifically, buy a thing all iteration on the thing should stop.<p>... Eh?\n\n    Allow me to suggest to you that this is the inverse of my actual opinion.\n\n  Your Steam Deck does everything it was meant to do even if a better model is out. This happens all the time, Nintendo also released an improved model with OLED, it doesn’t make my launch Switch worse but it’s great people have the option to upgrade to that.\n\n  Huh, I have TWO of the top end LCD models, bought them specifically because Valve hardware tends to be limited run and I didn&#x27;t want to be left in the dust when they moved on.<p>Now the OLED is out, they&#x27;re discontinuing the LCD models. Good thing I got two then! Feeling pretty vindicated about this.<p>It&#x27;s all a matter of perspective. Be happy you snagged one of the rare, discontinued SKU ;)\n\n  It isn&#x27;t exactly the same as OLED, but if you really want to upgrade your screen so much, you can look into the DeckHD screen.\n\n&gt; [NDI] it&#x27;s commonly used by modern planetariums and megachurches. It was perfect for our needs.<p>out of context but I love it\n\n  Continuing off-topic, my (very much not-mega) church used to use NDI (for overlaying the presentation onto the view of the speaker&#x2F;band) but we recently switched to using an extra HDMI hub + an HDMI capture card and had a notable improvement in performance&#x2F;framerate (on an underpowered laptop.)\n\nGlad that they didn&#x27;t tear it down afterwards. Seems like a fun artifact to have around the office.\n\nYou just wonder what the would would be like without Marketing.<p>Imagine we only had facts&#x2F;specs of equipment in advertising, and all these people maliciously using your own psychology against you, had productive jobs where they contribute more resources&#x2F;services to the world.<p>Steam is one of the good companies, but when I see this much effort go into marketing, it just makes me think of waste. There is poverty, environmental degradation, cancer... but hey: Look cool video to convince me to buy something.\n\n  Not to mention the waste of resources, manufacturing a bunch of computers to be used for a short period of time to create an ad to sell the same computer, before being relegated to the corner of an office to gather dust.\n\n    I quite liked this line from the article:<p>&gt; We figured we would need about 100 Steam Decks to pull this off. And as luck would have it, we had that many old OLED prototypes laying around the office.\n\n  I understand the feeling, but I think it is ultimately not marketings fault.<p>It is much more likely that the type of leadership that splurges on marketing would, if forced to put the money somewhere else, direct it to something else that directly serves their own personal needs. So if C-suit can&#x27;t boost their personal brand by ordering expensive marketing, they&#x27;ll more likely to spend on ostentatious offices or expensive company cars rather that headcount in in-house testing departments or getting technical writers to work on documentation.\n\n  I feel like you&#x27;re being way too cynical. You&#x27;re complaining about advertising for a gaming product, which also isn&#x27;t exactly something that one needs to survive. In your world where everything is only done because it is productive, gaming itself wouldn&#x27;t exist.\n\nI like the reference to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Barry Lyndon.<p>For anyone interested, the story of how he was able to film by candle light[1] is a really interesting bit of engineering in the pursuit of art.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neiloseman.com&#x2F;barry-lyndon-the-full-story-of-the-famous-f0-7-lenses&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neiloseman.com&#x2F;barry-lyndon-the-full-story-of-the-fa...</a>\n\nDid Valve re-render the &quot;Meet the Spy&quot; video for that gag in the article? Could you... pretty please do an official HD remastering of it? :)\n\n  this whole post is the most valve thing, valve has done in a while.<p>We built orb. Video shows building orb... there is no great reveal at the end no  crescendo.<p>We built orb and that&#x27;s it.<p>Love it.\n\n  Looks composited to me, look at the odd wobble of the picture overlapping the Gonarch, that&#x27;s not present in the original video.\n\n  I&#x27;ll always be peeved that Valve showcased Meet the Spy in SFM when they were advertising its release[1], yet never released the project files for it unlike their earlier shorts.<p>If they released the full project files to the public we could render our own HD remasters as we please.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Zri1c_If6Ic?t=73\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Zri1c_If6Ic?t=73</a>"

      "conversation_text": "Way out of my depth here, but I&#x27;m guessing the main hurdles to turning this into a drug are encapsulation in a way that survives injection (or better yet, ingestion) as well as either targeting of infected cells or at least ensuring that even if it touches every cell, it only affects HIV DNA?<p>Basically, what&#x27;s needed to commercialize this?\n\n  crispr also makes mistakes.  The kind that lead to cancer, disability and death.  It’s not a magic wand.  Being able to do something in cell culture is interesting but very far away from a therapy.\n\n    How do Casgevy and Lyfgenia[1] avoid these dangerous mistakes? Is it something that can be generalized to other therapies, or does it need to be recreated for each &quot;edit&quot; that we want to turn into a therapy?<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-approves-first-gene-therapies-treat-patients-sickle-cell-disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-appr...</a>\n\n      According to your link, both of those are applied to extracted stem cells which are then reintroduced. The ability to perform clonal expansion and DNA sequencing makes it possible that screening for off-target edits could be performed. Though I have no idea if it&#x27;s actually done.\n\n    Your point is broadly correct (not sure about disability though), but I think it overstates the danger of what will happen in practice. Yes, if you picked a random target and blasted away, you probably wouldn&#x27;t have a good time. But anything that even approaches clinical trials is going to get substantial engineering put into it to minimize (and characterize) all of the off-target loci. If there&#x27;s meaningful editing near an oncogene then that&#x27;s going to be a deal breaker for a particular guide. When the FDA was discussing the Casgevy application, they went into remarkable detail of how Vertex had measured the off-targets - the regulators really, really don&#x27;t want to approve anything risky.<p>Frankly just getting it to work at all is the real hurdle in this case.\n\n      &gt; If there&#x27;s meaningful editing near an oncogene then that&#x27;s going to be a deal breaker for a particular guide.<p>At this point do we know every gene that had the potential to cause cancer?\n\n        We roughly know the space of possible mutations in the human genomes because we have so many sequenced genomes now: if we don&#x27;t spot a mutation it&#x27;s probably not good when it happens, survivorship bias.<p>The problem with CRISPR is that we cannot control <i>where</i> the off-target effects happen, we can currently only optimise the guiding RNA and the Cas enzyme to have as little off-target effects as possible (but not 0, yet). It would be cool to engineer guiding RNAs that bind in those high mutation-rate areas when they have off-target effects, stuff can mutate there and nothing will happen (probably).\n\n      &gt; Frankly just getting it to work at all is the real hurdle in this case<p>This being the point.  Many diseases have been cured dozens of times over in a tissue sample in a lab that never make it to actual therapies because the hurdle is elsewhere.  The risks with crispr are as stated, especially flooding your entire body with it to target a virus.\n\n      &gt; Your point is broadly correct (not sure about disability though), but I think it overstates the danger of what will happen in practice<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrc1122\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrc1122</a>\n\n      One thing I was confused by: why did Vertex choose to reactivate HbF instead of attempting to correct the mutation that causes sickle cell disease in the first place?\n\n        CRISPR, in the form used by Vertex, is not capable of directly repairing an existing gene. In the case of sickle cell this means directly changing the mutated nucleotide in the HbA gene. CRISPR is very capable of <i>cutting</i> the genome at precise locations. These cuts lead to lossy repair pathways that introduce mutations or deletions that disable the gene at the spot that CRISPR cut. So, the best you can hope for is that the CRISPR cut leads to a loss of function. It&#x27;s possible to use CRISPR to introduce new sequences into the DNA, by introducing a new DNA sequence alongside the CRISPR proteins, then hoping that DNA repair &quot;accidentally&quot; uses the genetic sequence you put in to repair the break in the DNA. This is even less efficient than just cutting the DNA, and it would not fix the mutated HbA, so it&#x27;s not really therapeutically relevant for sickle cell.<p>There are more recent techniques, notably prime editing, that use a modified version of the CRISPR system that can introduce changes to single bases (nucleotides) in the genome. These have some promise of directly fixing diseases caused by single mutations, but there are hurdles in terms of efficiently delivering the prime editor to the right tissues as well as efficiency of the actual repair.\n\n          So how is Vertex activating HbF?  Did they find some bases to remove that cause the gene to be expressed more than usual?\n\n            They’re snipping another gene (BCL11A) that silences, or turns off, HbF. Turning off BCL11A then allows HbF to be expressed\n\n  Generally speaking:<p>- Delivery: getting the mRNA and guide RNA into the target cells<p>- Expression: ensuring the target cell expresses the mRNA, thus making the protein<p>- On Target Editing Efficiency: ensuring the intended edit happens at a high rate<p>- Off Target Editing: ensuring other edits in other locations do not occur\n\n  Does this means that in order to productionize this into a drug, one would need to basically engineer a biological virus?\n\n    <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Viral_vector\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Viral_vector</a>\n\n      or mRNA\n\n        CRISPR is pretty complicated - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not clear whether mRNA of such length could stably produce enough enzyme in enough places. It&#x27;s great when you need an antigen to be presented, but not so much when you need an entire restriction enzyme system.\n\n  There&#x27;s a sickle cell therapy that uses CRISPR. I don&#x27;t know the specifics but if one has been successful then a second can be too.  I&#x27;m looking forward to getting more information in the future. Cell culture vs cure is a long road but at least there&#x27;s hope. The big drawback is that these therapies are super expensive but time and experience in the past have proven that the costs can be lowered.<p>&quot;Sickle Cell Disease Approvals Include First CRISPR Gene Editing Therapy&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;2813761#:~:text=Casgevy%E2%80%94the%20CRISPR%2DCas9%20gene,preventing%20painful%20vaso%2Docclusive%20crises\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;28137...</a>.\n\n    Yup Casgevy &amp; Lyfgenia! These sickle cell (and now also approved for beta thalassemia) CRISPR therapies basically work in the following way:<p>- Blood stem cells are removed from the patient and the CRISPR Cas9 protein outside of the body is injected to cut the gene responsible for suppressing fetal hemoglobin production (even people with sickle cell have healthy fetal hemoglobin, their adult hemoglobin gene is what causes the deformed red blood cells)<p>- Chemotherapy is used to kill all living bone marrow and remove all previous unedited stem cells.<p>- New edited stem cells are inserted, and patient recovers with new blood production being of healthy red blood cells.<p>I&#x27;d say a huge step forward was FDA and EMA approval, but figuring out a way to remove previous unedited stem cells with chemotherapy would be a step change in the patient experience.\n\n      It&#x27;s both extremely sci-fi and incredibly terrifying that one of the steps for a cure is to quote unquote kill all living bone marrow. Modern medicine is fascinating in how advanced it can be.\n\n        Yeah it&#x27;s a spectacular transplant procedure, though it&#x27;s really not that modern medicine, it has been developed since the 50s! The step where you irradiate or apply chemo to kill off the existing bone marrow had to be done at first because the patients had leukemia so you had to do this anyway. An interesting thing is that if there are still cells left in you, they will be wiped clean by the new transplanted immune system in a so called graft-vs-host response that also sounds like a horror-movie concept :)\n\n        And yet, measles are back.\n\n        not sure if you need to kill absolutely all living bone marrow. Unlike cancer having 5% sickle cell red blood cells is probably fine. That makes the chemo probably way less bad than what you would need for cancer.\n\n      &quot;- Chemotherapy is used to kill all living bone marrow and remove all previous unedited stem cells.<p>- New edited stem cells are inserted, and patient recovers with new blood production being of healthy red blood cells.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s very likely HIV could be cured similarly. I believe all the people who have been cured so far are bone marrow transplant recipients in which the marrow had a specific gene or genes.\n\n    It&#x27;s very different, you only have to fix some of the bone marrow to help someone with sickle-cell, but you have to eliminate all reservoirs of HIV to cure AIDS.\n\n      I was under the understanding that HIV attacks only immune cells, white blood cell, only. All the issues that eventually kill are due to the body not being able to defend itself. So it seems like a cure would be very much similar to a sickle cell cure. Is that not the case?\n\n    A good video explanation of that too via Sci Show. It&#x27;s quite complex; chemo, lab work and takes a long time and not always successful but the majority of the time it is successful.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uHWD8RSw4As\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uHWD8RSw4As</a>\n\nRelevant xkcd <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1217\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1217</a>\n\n  Actually, a handgun is unlikely to kill bacteria.\n\n    It&#x27;s a joke, also the xkcd talks about cancer cells, not bacteria\n\nIs it the greatest day or the worst day (or both at the same time) of humanity when CRISPR is invented ?\n\n  probably great for humanity 2.0<p>amazing and scary stuff\n\n  Like nuclear\n\n  Probably not &quot;the greatest day&quot;, but definitely a very very good day.<p>I think it&#x27;s too easy to imagine Orwellian scenarios, but I think the real worries are much more subtle than people usually think, and they usually have more to do with how the world already works than with how it could change.\n\n  We had the ability to do what crispr did already, it just simplified the lab work. See TALEN and zinc finger nucleases.\n\nYou&#x27;d hope so.. the treatment is already in phase 1&#x2F;2 combined human trials!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crisprmedicinenews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;clinical-trial-update-positive-clinical-data-for-first-ever-crispr-therapy-for-hiv&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crisprmedicinenews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;clinical-trial-update-po...</a>\n\nThe big problem is that the CRISPR would need to be delivered to 100% of infected cells. And as far as I know (I&#x27;m a biologist) nobody has a method that can achieve a delivery rate of 100% in vivo.\n\n  That would be for a cure, but not for a recurrent therapy\n\n    Do we even need a cure or therapy if we can essentially use this as a vaccine?<p>Doesn&#x27;t help people now, but may eliminate it as a threat for future generations.\n\n      Well you can’t use it as a vaccine since there would be no hiv to preemptively excise.\n\n        What we need is a reliable CRISPR vaccine that confers the CCR5 SNP and essentially give it to everyone.\n\n          Yeah, we don’t even need to get every cell at that point, just a sizable number of the CD4 cells that are relatively easily accessible. The HIV would destroy every CD4 that isn’t CCR5 by itself. The antibodies would clean up the rest of the virons. Theoretically that would work as a cure too if you could excise the hiv and insert the CCR5 widely enough.\n\n    Could that risk evolutionary pressure on whatever is left behind so that mutations emerge that are more aggressive?\n\n      If we assume that the treatment needs to reach the HIV cell to effect it, and that the danger is not 100% of the cells are reached, would it produce evolutionary pressure?  The survivors aren&#x27;t interacting with whatever got its buddies, right?\n\n        That itself is an evokutionary pressure.  Whatever allowed them to get missed would get amplified by reproduction.  Only if it&#x27;s entirely utterly and only random chance and not something like the method doesn&#x27;t target certain cells would it not be applying pressure\n\n          If you bomb a cow pasture with napalm, you aren&#x27;t going to be left with napalm resistant cows. Just lucky ones. And luck isn&#x27;t genetic.\n\n            You&#x27;re viewing the cows in isolation here. Replace the cows with cancer cells with different mutations and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.<p>There&#x27;s research going with certain types of cancer where the doses of cancer-killing drugs isn&#x27;t intended to eradicate all cancer cells, but to keep it at a level that&#x27;s manageable with future treatments.<p>The theory being that if you go too far, cells that are left with a &quot;lucky&quot; mutation can grow without competition, leaving the patient in an even-less treatable state down the line.\n\n              ... Cancer cells? This is about HIV. What are you talking about?\n\n                you&#x27;re talking about cows in a HIV discussion, so I could have said &quot;cows and napalm? we&#x27;re talking about HIV!&quot;, but I&#x27;m charitably engaging with your analogy to show that evolutionary pressure is an active research area in disease treatment.\n\n            But there&#x27;s a chance that any survivors learn to hide from planes and you&#x27;ve now given an evolutionary pressure to cows to hide when hearing airplanes or helicopters.  Along with that a pressure that makes the ones that blend in less likely to be spotted to be bombed.  So yes, you&#x27;re right you probably won&#x27;t get cows that can survive napalm itself but now you&#x27;ve got cows with camouflage and an instinct to hide.\n\n      The selection pressure would have to be some form of resisting the crispr tools from entering the cell or functioning in the cell.<p>The HIV genome is small and I would be surprised if it were so easy for such a thing to come about.\n\n        I&#x27;m thinking more of a mutation already present that has less treatable traits but can&#x27;t spread because neighbouring cells are already infected. But then when the treatment is delivered, it isn&#x27;t cleared because of the difficulty of the delivery mechanism, but the treatment <i>does</i> clear up the surrounding cells, providing fresh ground for the mutated strain to reinfect.<p>(This is an active research area I&#x27;ve read about in cancer treatment, where it&#x27;s been suggested that being too aggressive with clearing certain cancers encourages reservoirs  of already mutated aggressive variants to be unleashed after treatment whereas before the avenues they had to spread were already infected with the less aggressive variant).\n\n          ... and so?<p>Evolutionary pressure is present in any situation and is unavoidable. It still has an effect even in cases where treatments are effective with a success rate of 100%: the selection of diseases for which there is no cure.<p>Entertaining such a perspective can lead to an extreme and undesirable conclusion, that the only logical outcome is to do nothing and dismantle the entire modern medical practice.<p>It&#x27;s not very constructive.\n\n            Other posters have explained why my concerns aren&#x27;t warranted for this situation, I&#x27;m asking the questions to learn a little.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s not very constructive.\n&gt;Entertaining such a perspective can lead to an extreme and undesirable conclusion, that the only logical outcome is to do nothing and dismantle the entire modern medical practice.<p>Disagree, if you read my parent comment in this thread, I talk about the research going on in cancer to account for evolutionary pressure, and the conclusion they arrived at is nowhere near &quot;do nothing&quot;.<p>It is instead a change in treatment protocols to aim for less aggressive treatment, the clinic in questions motto is for the patients to die from something other than their cancer by having them on a protocol that has them live permanently with their cancer under the thesis that aggressrive attempts at eradication risk a stronger variant resurging.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s not applicabale for all types of cancer which is why it&#x27;s research, and why I&#x27;m not telling anyone that evolutionary pressure is a concern here, but am simply asking the question to learn if there are similar concerns between cancer and hiv disease treatments.\n\n          This doesn&#x27;t make sense.  HIV virus is generally not &quot;substrate limited&quot;&#x2F;competing with other virii in its propagation in patients in (temporary) remission -- that&#x27;s basically all of them that don&#x27;t have AIDS.  HIV retro integrates into host DNA and sporadically resurges on a stochastic basis, the drug cocktails in use  inhibits this process.<p>Generally the viral load of a patient with HIV is miniscule but must always be kept in check.<p>Note that the point of a crispr treatment is that it would delete dormant HIV sequences that are hiding in the host DNA and not currently producing virii but threatening to pop up at some time in the future.<p>Obviously this too is subject to evolutionary pressures but almost certainly not the ones you are thinking of.\n\n            That&#x27;s good to know thanks, I&#x27;m very much a layperson in my readings and was curious as to how it differed.\n\n  Does it need to be 100%? We have dormant viruses that are domant and would only activate when conditions are good, like colds, and we have ways to deal with it.  It’s an analogy, for aids we would deal with it with meds and press it back there by turning it into a sort of nuisance like colds.  The issue is cost and stigma of passing it. I for one still wouldn’t want aids to be as prevalent as the cold even if it’s super easy to deal with.\n\n  There are specific latent reservoirs the HIV hides in. It wouldn’t need to get every cell in the body, just have a favorable probability distribution to hit the reservoirs.\n\n  I thought the biggest problem was off-target editing (I&#x27;m <i>not</i> a biologist)\n\n  If you can get a reasonably high percentage then this might not be a problem. Include something in the crisper treatment that acts as a marker that protects the cells to which the treatment is successfully delivered. Then kill everything without the marker. I don&#x27;t know what fraction of of your CD4 cells you need to maintain a healthy immune system, but I imagine even a double digit percentage reduction is probably tolerable, especially if the reduction is only temporary.\n\n  In-vivo is hard but there are many talented teams working on this. In animals, a company called Verve has discovered how to make in vivo CRISPR work via nanoparticles to the liver which achieves &gt;80% delivery at certain concentrations of nanos. Pretty fascinating\n\nScience by press release. The results aren&#x27;t even preprinted yet. Only some methods in a 2022 preprint. Looks hyped up, I&#x27;d ignore.<p>&gt; This press release is based on abstracts P0004 P0006, P0013, P0026 and P0004 at the \nEuropean Congress of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases (ECCMID). The material \nhas been peer reviewed by the congress selection committee. Only material from P0004 has \nbeen published in a preprint article.

      "conversation_text": "I don&#x27;t know Indonesian import law but I would guess that this guy making batteries for his local business might have better quality than what I assume is the alternative, imported Chinese batteries. I wonder why so much concern over safety. I would be much more concerned about Chinese imported batteries since you don&#x27;t always have a brand name and QC.\n\n  &gt; since you don&#x27;t always have a brand name and QC<p>Some guy DIY-ing batteries in his shop is pretty much the epitome of &quot;no brand name and QC&quot; though.

Those botched together mains wires alone look like a fire risk.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you haven&#x27;t been to Indonesia. This style of wiring is common in businesses and homes in Indonesia, Thailand and lot of poorer asian countries. The regulations are weak or unenforced. Often unlicensed people build houses, run power, water etc.<p>It&#x27;s (probably unintentionally) dishonest to judge this by a first world standard.\n\n      Physics is the standard - it ignites or not - and it doesn&#x27;t care where you are.\n\n  &gt; better quality than what I assume is the alternative, imported Chinese batteries.<p>You do realise that China makes some of the worlds best batteries right?<p>There is a reason why BYD, EVE and CATL are in the news all the time and it&#x27;s not because they suck.<p>Quality wise Chinese&#x2F;Korean&#x2F;Japanese batteries are all pretty much the same on NCA&#x2F;NCM chemistries. China has a big advantage in LFP but LFP is shitty for an e-bike because the reduced density penalty is much more meaningful than in a car.<p>Those companies make cells of course but there is also plenty of high quality BMS available and fully assembled batteries out of China too obviously.\n\n    China also makes some of the worlds worst batteries. (Source: all the products I had to return after 1 or fewer successful charges.)\n\n      They are doing exactly what the advocates of free market dream of. You want to pay as little as possible, you get the crappiest stuff, you are willing to pay more to get top quality, you get good stuff.\n\n        In many product categories there is no top stuff, just keep buying the crap stuff until you find the specimen that works. Maybe &quot;keep repeating&quot; is a proxy for free market goodness, I can honestly not tell anymore. :-D\n\n        That would be fine if there was a way to differentiate crap from not crap. Price is a signal, but an increasingly shitty one in that I can pay a high price and still receive crap.<p>The free market is happy to sell me crap at high prices with no ability to know that until the deal is irreversible.<p>The theoretical free market also has perfect information, and the current markets actively work to obscure that.\n\n    They are having huge issues with e-bike fires in China. Here you have an article with two Chinese researchers weighing in on the issue.[0] According to them low quality batteries are the reason for the number of deadly fires.<p>So yes, Chinese ebike batteries are on a whole of low quality.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sixthtone.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;1013638\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sixthtone.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;1013638</a>\n\n      Given the numbers cited there it looks like Chinese e-bikes have a fire rate of 0.002391% per year. From a quick search it seems like there were about 130 e-bike fires in NYC in 2022 out of a population of about 65000 e-bikes, so NYC based e-bikes have a failure rate of 0.2% per year which seems significantly worse than the cheap ones used throughout China.\n\n        Did you read what the experts said? It doesn&#x27;t matter if the incident rate is higher in NYC, anything about NYC has no bearing on this. The fires in china are due to low quality batteries.\n\n        I don&#x27;t think there has been any sort of reliable survey on the quantity of ebikes in NYC, and 65,000 is likely to be extremely low. There is no registration or point-of-sale reporting requirement.<p>There are also large quantities of unregistered electric and gasoline mopeds and motorcycles, many of which are also labeled as ebikes by either their manufacturers&#x2F;importers or public authorities when involved in an incident.<p>One can purchase custom-made ebike batteries in NYC from shops similar to the one in this article, often with substantially worse finishing&#x2F;packaging quality and unknown BMS quality. And said batteries are often run hard in delivery service in 4-season conditions, including exposure to temperatures well below freezing and salty slush spray, then charged via chargers and cords of unknown quality plugged into what are often pre-WWII electrical systems.<p>The FDNY is appropriately raiding custom battery shops in NYC, since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an appropriate regulatory system yet for custom-manufacturing this sort of energy storage device in a dense urban environment yet:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ny1.com&#x2F;nyc&#x2F;all-boroughs&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;queens-biz-raided--accused-of-illegal-lithium-ion-batteries-manufacturing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ny1.com&#x2F;nyc&#x2F;all-boroughs&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;queens-biz-...</a>\n\n    Do you really think these bicycle batteries are being powered by BYD? Like I said I don&#x27;t know the their market well but if its similar to other markets in the region, they are importing low quality generic branded stuff that may be worse off than those local manufacturer who have a real incentive to try to product higher quality products.\n\n      Do you really think there are tons of dodgy Chinese companies producing battery cells? A notoriously technically difficult, capital intensive and above all massively competitive business with tiny margins unless you are running the absolute best process at enormous scale?<p>No. There is just a handful of companies producing cells at reasonable scale and cost. Pretty much every cell you can buy from Alibaba (which is almost certainly where these e-bike pack makers are buying from) come from just 7 companies: CATL, BYD, EVE, CALB, Gotion, Sunwoda and Farasis.<p>All of these companies make high quality cells and these are definitely the only ones with a good enough price&#x2F;performance to shove in a hand-made e-bike pack and make a profit.<p>This notion that Chinese batteries are somehow bad is ludicrous and the lengths people go to state as fact something they clearly have no experience with is intellectual dishonesty at best.\n\n        I can see you are very passionate on this topic. I did not realize in the article that these shops were actually making individual cells but the rather the complete pack. My notion was that the complete pack may be safer than complete packs coming from china under generic fake names. Thanks for clearing it up. You clearly have a lot of experience in this area with incredible honesty but low capability at following thoughts.\n\n        The fact is that there are demonstrably under-specced batteries being sold. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qMZuHMlRw_0&amp;t=579s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qMZuHMlRw_0&amp;t=579s</a>)<p>Is this just a case of people buying reputable batteries and selling them under their own brand name with higher specs? If so, why do these 7 manufacturers make bad batteries?<p>Clearly there are plenty of badly made cells out there, so I think I&#x27;m misunderstanding something.\n\n        &gt; Do you really think there are tons of dodgy Chinese companies producing battery cells?<p>Are you serious? Yes, obviously. Spend 5 minutes on Alibaba looking at the panoply of companies selling cheap cells, and reading forum posts from people who build their own batteries unfortunate enough to buy those cells.\n\n      The quality of individual cells does not necessarily have any bearing on the safety of the finished battery&#x2F;BMS&#x2F;charger.\n\n        Never suggested otherwise.\n\nPacks, battery packs.<p>This is very common for DIY ebikes.\n\n  It <i>used</i> to be that one assembled batteries of cells. But language changes I suppose.\n\n    In this case, each cell is also a standalone battery (an 1850 I presume). Assemblage of these is either called a module or a pack.\n\n      An 18650 is a single cell. (Or a <i>battery</i> in modern parlance.) Now, get off my lawn! :-D  Just kidding! The terminology shifted. But a cell used to be the single unit of chemistry and catode and anode that gives the native voltage. So an 18650 would be a cell. A 1.5V alkaline would be a cell. A 9V alkaline would be a battery of six cells! And so on.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> nowadays to say an 18650 is a battery.\n\n  Not even disagreeing with you, but it&#x27;s a funny evolution of language when you consider the origin of the term battery.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artillery_battery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artillery_battery</a><p>We owe the term to Benjamin Franklin, who used it to describe what you&#x27;re referring to as a pack (although Leyden jars are considered capacitors rather than batteries in modern terms).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electric_battery#Invention\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electric_battery#Invention</a>\n\nThere&#x27;s a small youtube channel[1] I follow where a guy I think is from Indonesia builds his own handheld coil guns and railguns including his own charging circuit designs. Pretty crazy&#x2F;fun stuff. There seems to be quite a bit of an electronics hacking scene going on there.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@DNAP460&#x2F;videos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@DNAP460&#x2F;videos</a>\n\nFrom the pictures I get the sense this guy knows what he&#x27;s doing. Sure his shop&#x27;s a little dusty, and that fume extractor is maybe a little ghetto (better than my aquarium filter duct taped to a fan though).<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell what those grey cells are being used in the pack, which is probably most important factor, but the construction of it appears solid. It&#x27;s also evident from photo that he is disassembling a damaged pack. See the missing row of cells at the top, and corrosion on the bottom in this photo: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;149346090.v2.pressablecdn.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;NYIMASLAULA_ROW_Bali_Ebike_8587-600x900.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;149346090.v2.pressablecdn.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;202...</a>\n\n  They look like standard 1865 cells but obviously not high enough res to spot the manufacturer. I would imagine EVE though. CATL is too hard to get a hold of but EVE Grade A is still pretty easily available from Alibaba.\n\n    EVE would be my guess too, possibly INR18650-35V, which seems totally cromulent for an ebike.<p>EVE cells are also used in newer Ryobi power tools, it&#x27;s worth pointing out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ryobi&#x2F;comments&#x2F;oxn53g&#x2F;psa_ryobi_is_using_chinese_18650_cells_in_most_of&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ryobi&#x2F;comments&#x2F;oxn53g&#x2F;psa_ryobi_is_...</a>\n\n      Simpsons did it.\n\n    I think you mean 18650?  Unless 1865 is a new battery standard that has 10x the capacity, in which case EDC light with 1000 hours runtime here we go!\n\n      They are indeed called 1865 cells too. The 0 at the end, according to some sources, indicates the cylinder form factor; I couldn&#x27;t find a definitive reference for this though.<p>But you will find articles and sources online referring to them as 1865 cells, like Wikipedia.<p>&quot;An 18650 battery[1] or 1865 cell[2] is a cylindrical lithium-ion battery common in electronic devices&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;18650_battery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;18650_battery</a><p>I imagine Tesla calling their new battery a 4680 (opposed to a 46800) also leads to this usage.\n\n        Yeah it&#x27;s abbreviated sometimes and I&#x27;m lazy. I should have added the 0 for clarity.\n\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacquesmattheij.com&#x2F;long-range-ebike&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacquesmattheij.com&#x2F;long-range-ebike&#x2F;</a><p>Not the only ones!\n\n  I was super envious of this when he first posted it here...<p>However - I bought a ~7,000 e-bike and I love&#x2F;hate it:<p>I have an Orbea Rise H30 - and its ~36 lbs. The problem is that the magnets in the motor are always engaged - meaning that even when the bike is &#x27;off&#x27; I am fighting against the magnets - and it governs me and when off, no matter how hard I pedal - I cant get about 11 miles an hour.<p>It is a type 2 - so it is not supposed to boost you passed 20 miles an hour - but instead it effectively governs you to 20 mph. Its very hard to get it much faster - the fastest I have gotten to is 24.5 mph. Downhill.<p>However - when the battery is powered - its great, except you have to only keep it on BOOST which is the highest of three settings (eco, trail, boost)<p>I&#x27;d not buy this bike again. It range is really around ~30 miles - and they have a range booster battery pack for $600 - and I should have bought that when I had the money to throw at it... but yeah the bike sucks when the battery dies.\n\n    On my bike, I found that disconnecting the battery made the magnets spin freely.\n\n    I have a Shimano middrive bike that weighs 50lbs that I purchased on closeout for $1500. It rides like a nice, albeit heavy, bike with the motor turned off.\n\n  You can do better then that.<p>CYC motor kits can take up to 72v, and they don&#x27;t care about talking to the BMS of the battery, so you can pretty much run any battery.<p>The final reduction is external, so they sell different chainring sizes. With higher voltage, you get more motor speed, so you can do a bigger reduction for the same power, which means lower motor required torque for the same wheel torque, which gives you efficiency.<p>I have the 52v setup from them on a full suspension mountain bike, with the 416wh battery, and I have done 30 miles on it with pedal assist and knobby mountain bike tires and basically got the battery down about halfway (im fairly fit and have a higher FTP so I don&#x27;t require much assist).<p>If I was to build a setup like in your post, with a big 72v battery taking up the entire front triangle of the bike, and use faster rolling tires, I could either have an ebike that can probably keep up with cars on a highway under throttle, or in the pedal assist mode, do over 100 miles.\n\nAre those LiPo or LiIon? The articles mention both, and the image looks like LiIon\n\n  Photos are showing Li-ion 18650 cells afaict<p>Those are the most common for e-bike batteries\n\nVarious YouTubers do similar to build effectively Tesla powerwalls<p>It seems quite risky even for those that are careful. I recall one of the bigger channels ending up eating humble pie when they had a fire.<p>Not something I’d ever want to do unless I could house in in an outdoor shed quite far away from everything else\n\nI keep thinking Ripperdocs in Cyberpunk world. Looks dodgy alright, but it&#x27;s in their best interest to not screw up because I know in Indonesia &quot;homemade&quot; usually literally means made at home, and houses in Indonesia typically share walls between adjoining houses, so if you burn your house your neighbors will not be happy.\n\nQuestion I have: is it just a bunch of cells wired up, or is there a BMS (battery management system) in there doing the things you need to do to make a battery safe and make it last: cell balancing is essential to make sure the pack will survive more then a few charges and rides before it will kill itself. Also I would not like a battery pack that does not switch itself off when voltages or currents get too high, which is a great way to start a thermal runaway. Not a safety issue, but important to make sure the battery is not abused is to prevent deep discharge voltage or charging the battery at too low temperature.\n\n  Hi -- editor of the piece here. There is a BMS, that&#x27;s the main other component aside from the cells. We had that detail initially but it got cut for space.\n\n    A shame, because seeing how you can get and apply a BMS to a build is probably where much of the readership interest lies.<p>How &#x27;programmable&#x27; is the BMS typically? is it arduino programming hard? Can you e.g. shape the charge profile. set the stop point, route around damaged cells? is the BMS field upgradable?<p>I&#x27;m guessing its a commodotized un-upgradable closed solution and you set the params on purchase (alibaba) and its how it works forever.\n\n      Take a look at the TI BQ79616-Q1, which has been used in some Tesla packs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;BQ79616-Q1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;BQ79616-Q1</a><p>Yes, it&#x27;s programmable. Even has eight GPIO pins. It would be &quot;field programmable&quot; in the sense that if you scraped the conformal coating off the pogo pin pads you could reflash it... which you probably don&#x27;t want to do.<p>Despite what the article says, a BMS doesn&#x27;t actually do many of the things you mention. It balances cells, monitors temps, and sets fault flags if something&#x27;s wrong. A BMS chip does not charge the battery, it doesn&#x27;t determine max voltage, (the charger does that) and it can&#x27;t isolate a bad cell. (Because they&#x27;re all welded together! Pack current doesn&#x27;t actually pass through the BMS-- it only has thin balancing wires to each cell which can&#x27;t handle much current.)\n\n        I take your point it doesn&#x27;t <i>do</i> these things but the potential was there in hypothesis to <i>control</i> these things.\n\n          Sure, but the battery+BMS can&#x27;t control those things. If you wanted to set charge parameters the easiest thing to do would be to buy a third party lithium ion battery charger, like the Tenergy TB-6AB, and set a capacity limit.\n\n        Usually the BMS in such packs does have control over the flow in and out of the battery: it can isolate the connections if there&#x27;s an overcurrent or over&#x2F;undervoltage (or overtemp). That&#x27;s usually the main contribution to safety. And it&#x27;s also pretty typical that the BMS is what defines the charging profile: the charger basically just follows instructions from the BMS (and if it doesn&#x27;t, said isolation comes into play as protection). This doesn&#x27;t necessarily all happen on one chip: in the larger packs this is likely distributed between a few different components, including a chunky contactor for the isolation.\n\n  Cheap active bms systems. Could be hazardous as well. But needed for charging from a 48v charger block.\n\nWow this is scary. LiPo are very dangerous and even NMC which are stabler are very error prone when assembled in an ebike pack: the cells need to be high quality (LG, Panasonic), the assembly need to be very careful (so many ways for the interconnects to become a liability and cause a fire) the BMS needs to be quality (or it&#x27;ll overheat and cause a fire). It&#x27;s hard to make it right when careful, and even decently sized companies mess it up.<p>Slapping together some LiPo? It&#x27;s just a matter of when, not if.<p>Recently published very relevant talk by Grin: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;j92Gt4VviSQ?si=0TV_HqZBEBuVDqdx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;j92Gt4VviSQ?si=0TV_HqZBEBuVDqdx</a><p>Otherwise I think these things are super cool, but in the case of lithium ebike batteries, they look so innocent and easy to build, and are so dangerous. I&#x27;m speaking from being humbled myself after building two NMC packs with cell-fuses, a spot welder, being careful... I&#x27;m dead scared of my packs.\n\n  <i>Wow this is scary.</i><p>Not really.<p><i>LiPo are very dangerous and even NMC which are stabler</i><p>LiPo refers to lithium polymer, which doesn&#x27;t mean a different chemistry. It means &quot;polymer electrolyte instead of a liquid electrolyte&quot;.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lithium_polymer_battery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lithium_polymer_battery</a><p><i>are very error prone when assembled in an ebike pack</i><p>There are billions of 18650 battery packs out there now in general.<p><i>the cells need to be high quality (LG, Panasonic)</i><p>No, the cells need have their specs correct and the packs need to be built according to cells&#x27; specs.<p><i>the BMS needs to be quality (or it&#x27;ll overheat and cause a fire).</i><p>The BMS is there to limit things like discharge voltage, charge voltage, discharge amps, etc. It makes things safer.\n\n    You may think so, and I encourage you to watch the video I shared. I held many of the same conclusions&#x2F;approximations until learning of Grin&#x27;s experience.\n\n      The video you linked is problems that can happen and things that can go wrong. It seems more like something the battery makers should watch instead of proof that batteries are inherently unsafe.\n\n        The article is about battery makers.\n\n          Who do you think I was talking about when I said &quot;It seems more like something the battery makers should watch&quot; ?\n\n            My understanding of our conversation:<p>* You: That video is not relevant because it&#x27;s about battery makers<p>* Me: The conversation is about battery makers<p>It seems I&#x27;m missing something.\n\n              The person who linked it was saying it is evidence of batteries being unsafe because it goes over things that can go wrong.<p>I was saying it&#x27;s educational for battery makers and the video isn&#x27;t about batteries being unsafe, the guy in the video makes his own batteries and is talking about what to avoid.\n\n  They aren&#x27;t slapping LiPos together. They aren&#x27;t even using LiPos. LiPo are usually single small cells pouches in phones and gizmos. These are Li-Ion 18650 cells like Samsung 50e&#x27;s being nickle spot welded into ~60V arrangements, with every 4.2V &quot;p-pack&quot; getting a wire to the Battery Management System circuit board. All charge and discharge does thru the approval of the BMS and gets cut off if any cell shows anything abnormal (short, too much resistance (voltage dipping), undervolted, overvolted). The photos look just as professionally made as another other factory. Unwrap literally any random e-bike&#x27;s battery and you&#x27;ll find identical construction. A few rare brands also pot the battery in thermal epoxy to make them even more safe. Yes fire and liability are scary for battery pack builders but this guys shop doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing anything bad.\n\n  Why not use LiFePO4? Those should be much more stable.\n\n    Power density is much lower.  On a vehicle you have to pedal one the power is out, weight savings matters.\n\n      Having to pedal without power from battery is extremely rare on e-bikes. They have range of 100km+ and few people bike that much between charges.<p>LFP:s are less popular for DYI because you need a much smarter BMS to deal with the flat voltage curve when charging. A cheap, easily available open source LFP BMS should solve that.\n\n        You don’t need a “much smarter” BMS for LFP, Daly BMS for LiPo and LFP are roughly the same price.\n\n          For SoC many ebike BMS just use voltage curve to give a rough approximation. But with LFP you need a shunt and a coulomb counter, because the voltage curve is essentially flat until the very last Wh.\n\n        I ended up pedaling without power on a 3 hour trip in the mountains on a 750Wh battery&#x2F;85Nm motor. Can be easily done ;-)\n\n  I am building similar battery packs for long range uavs. We have many different configurations. Like 12s24p. 48v with total of 252 4.2v cells. We put them in 3d printed holders and spotweld them. Takes about 30 minutes to make one battery. \nBms systems are available widely. Its rare to have dangerous issues. Even with chinese clones. \nMost of the accidents happening when nickel strips are cut and accidentally falling on open battery packs.\n\n    I agree that it&#x27;s fun and can often be safe if built correctly for the right application. But I think UAVs don&#x27;t experience the same beating and vibrations that ebike batteries do, which I think is what the bigger problem is with ebike batteries in particular. Unless carefully built, things like balance wires can shafe and cause a short, the spot-welded tabs can break off or the connection resistance increase, leading to hot spot. The BMS can have hot spots (FET based ones in particular) that lead to failure or electrical fires over time. Humidity mixed with various electrical potentials on nearby PCB traces causes corrosion and eventually failure of the BMS, etc. And it&#x27;s not all the BMSes that are built the same, they may all have the same set of features on the happy path, but they&#x27;re not all created equal when their PCB starts failing and fail-safes are required.<p>Basically in a &quot;tough&quot; environment like ebikes, I think the aging of the pack is much accelerated, which leads to lower mean-time between incidents. Combine that with the profile of the average buyer (wants the cheapest, longest range battery they can get) and it&#x27;s an even higher probability.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I absolutely love custom DIY packs. It&#x27;s just way more dangerous than meets the eye, especially in dirty and high vibration environments.\n\nNote that while the article says &quot;soldering&quot; the pictures show &quot;welding&quot;, which is the typical way you create battery packs.  The reasons are that the welding provides a higher temperature connection but for a shorter period of time, over all dumping less heat into the battery and potentially causing damage to the cell or triggering ignition.  Also makes a higher temp connection, solder can melt when the joints get hot during use.<p>I got a battery welder a few years ago to repair an ebike pack and also to repair a EGO power tool battery pack, but thus far haven&#x27;t used it.  The ebike pack was a bunch of &quot;packets&quot; rather than 18650 cells, and the EGO was slightly smaller than 18650, so I need to wait for another pack to fail so I can scavenge cells from one to repair the other.<p>Be careful if it smells like birthday cake when you&#x27;re working with lion cells, that can preclude them bursting into flames.  Have a metal container nearby to drop them into for transport outdoors.\n\n  preclude: I think you mean that can be a prelude to. Though could also be presage.\n\n    I think I was going for &quot;precedes&quot;.\n\n      Ah. That makes sense.\n\n  <i>&gt;Have a metal container nearby to drop them into for transport outdoors.</i><p>Before doing that, try watching some experiments with fireproof containers specifically designed for these fires, to have an idea how quick and violent this can be, and how bad most of these containers are at preventing it from going from 0 to inferno or to a toxic cloud suffocating you in seconds. This might or might not help you plan for the worst case, or better yet forget about doing DIY battery pack repairs at all.\n\n    &gt; forget about doing DIY battery pack repairs at all.<p>Yah, some things it&#x27;s best to not learn the hard way.<p>But if you&#x27;re intent on doing it, to it outside on a concrete slab.\n\n      P.S. I do anything that involves fumes or dust outside, such as painting, solvents, etc.\n\n    What do people do in factories?<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of the idea that some repairs are meant to be performed only by &quot;experts&quot; and that nobody should ever try to learn how to make them. It fuels an industry of people charging hundreds or thousands of dollars per repair to install cheap parts, and it&#x27;s part of the reason our society throws so much stuff away.<p>Sure lithium ion packs are dangerous, but there is a manufacturing process that: welds cells together to make banks, and that sometimes produces a runaway reaction inside the cells. Given that that&#x27;s the case, it should be entirely possible to do that safely in a controlled environment inside of a garage.<p>This is the same attitude that informs our decision not to repair garage door springs. Or more relevantly the same attitude that tells us to just use whatever async library du jour exists but never to learn about the internals of that library. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about what&#x27;s under the hood, that&#x27;s dangerous stuff&quot; says the dealer&#x27;s mechanic.\n\n      Do you perform your own dentistry?\n\n        Touche.\n\n        It&#x27;s not the same thing because I don&#x27;t have training to be a dentist, but I do have training and skills and knowledge for a variety of non-dentist mechanical, electrical, and electronic things. So this is a specious argument. Where does it end? Do I not do any work myself ever? Or are there things we can all agree some people are capable of doing?<p>I think the gatekeeping around all of this stuff from people is frankly kind of ridiculous. It&#x27;s not like the battery repairmen are doing asbestos abatement naked in their living rooms while their families are watching TV. But people are treating it like the same thing.\n\n          Capability is fine but also goes hand in hand with risk. Working on lipo&#x2F;li-ion cells is risky which is usually why such work is not zoned for residential areas. How would your skills and training translate into something a neighbor or inspector can understand? Would you resent them for questioning your non-dentist abilities? Is someone with no formal training but years of practical knowledge working on devices enough?<p>It seems like the questions from my end bend back toward proving yourself when a situation breaks, not when it works, which is what sometimes happens when you do work yourself. Have you heard the parable of the nuclear boy scout, David Hahn?\n\n          &gt; I do have training and skills and knowledge for a variety of non-dentist mechanical, electrical, and electronic things.<p>A fundamental of expertise is knowing the terrain, what you can and can&#x27;t do safely and reliably. A fundamental of knowledge is becoming aware of far more that you don&#x27;t know; only in ignorance do we imagine there is little outside our personal boundaries.<p>Highly experienced professionals will tell me, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know how to do that, you should talk to ...&#x27;, and will refuse to even venture advice. My doctor tells me to talk to a specialist. Naive, immature amatuers assure me they can do anything, and can diagnose and treat my medical condition via social media.\n\n        Don’t you? When there’s something wrong in your mouth, do you look in the mirror, use your tongue on it, use a toothbrush or floss or toothpick on the problem before going to see the dentist? Or do you feel pain in your mouth and magically you’re at the dentist without doing any of the above?\n\n          I don&#x27;t bust out the drill or try to apply putty for a temporary tooth.<p>That is to say, yes, I can confidently exchange batteries (clean my teeth).  I&#x27;m not confident in modifying those batteries with a welder&#x2F;soldering iron.<p>If I clean my teeth and they still hurt you bet I&#x27;m going to the dentist.\n\n            For people who do this, it&#x27;s more like changing batteries, than modifying them. You only put the batteries into the slots and attach metal wires to the ends - isn&#x27;t that a lot like changing batteries already? The device which attaches the wires is simple to use: you press it against the connection, press the foot switch and it makes a little spark and now the wire is attached. If you know what you are doing, building a battery pack out of pre-fabricated cells is not scary.\n\n              Then what are they welding in the OP?\n\n                I don&#x27;t see any pictures of welding happening in the OP. I do see a battery pack constructed with the usual spot-welded metal strips. The spot welder is the machine that you press against the connection, press the switch and it goes zap and you have a connection. It isn&#x27;t especially dangerous, as far as I know. It uses a low-voltage high-current pulse to melt and fuse the metal only at the contact points.\n\n                  Errors that may lead to a thermal runaway: Accidentally shorting a cell. Putting the cell in backwards. Putting a highly charged cell with discarded cells (or vica versa). Using a damaged cell. Any of these can happen rather easily, with potentially disastrous consequences to life and property.\n\n                    Many things are dangerous. Use caution and have a backup plan (keep the area non-flammable and keep a bucket of sand nearby) and you&#x27;ll be fine.\n\n                      &gt; Many things are dangerous.<p>That&#x27;s not a rational response. Everything is dangerous. The issue is how dangerous they are.\n\n        Yes, sometimes, when it’s not convenient to utilize infrastructure where I am.<p>So far I have become adept at removing and replacing my own crown, including heavily modifying when needed, filling if they aren’t too deep (or temporary fillings if they are deep) and one extraction when I was at sea and had no better choice.<p>I don’t recommend it if it’s not necessary, but for those who may find themselves in that situation there is a book called “where there is no dentist” that outlines most common procedures and tool use. It’s worth learning if you’re likely to be away from “civilization “. Also “where there is no doctor “ can be a lifesaver.\n\n          You extracted your own tooth!? Woah. Speaking as someone who has seen people evacuated from Antarctica for dental issues, I&#x27;d like to read a blog post or something about that.\n\n            Of course, in such a case , you’ve likely waited (as I had) until the tooth is really bad. Despite antibiotics.<p>I think because of the infection it was quite loose, and prying a little with the elevator was all it took to get it to where it could pull it out with my fingers.  If I had not had dental tools, it might have been much harder.<p>The pain is already really bad, yanking it out really wasn’t much worse than the steady state and once the nerves were severed it was instant reduction in discomfort.<p>Half a bottle of gin made it easier. The hard part was having to wait until the sea conditions were good enough that I felt like I could safely be numb-faced drunk.\n\n        Do trained dentists perform their own dentistry?\n\n      <i>&gt; What do people do in factories?</i><p>Ventilation. Compartmentalization. Controlled processes with early warnings. Proper tools. Quality control. Active fire suppression. Not doing that at home with your wife, kids, and your dog.<p>Sure, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, can deal with thermal runaway, and can trust your work afterwards, nobody stops you from doing it. I&#x27;ve done it myself (never tried anything larger than a e-bike battery though). Just keep in mind that you&#x27;re working with a firebomb that deceptively looks like an electronic device.\n\n        To add on to this, for most things the failure condition is that the thing doesn&#x27;t work. Here the failure condition is a very high energy reaction and should be given the proper respect vis a vis safety.\n\n      Not an ideal analogy. A better analogy is &quot;would you hire an electrician to do task XYZ?&quot; Nothing stopping you from learning enough to do amateur electrician work -- but at a certain point, the risk to reward ratio becomes poor for most people and not a good investment. At a certain point, you&#x27;re doing it to sate your curiosity -- not an invalid motivation by any means, but it&#x27;s not necessarily driven by practicality.\n\n        You say that, but it sure was nice, last year when my dryer kept popping the breaker, for me to be able to easily track down that the electrician that replaced my panel ~8 years ago had (a) used the wrong breaker for the dryer, (b) used a physically damaged breaker, and (c) improperly torqued one of the legs leading to the dryer.<p>Learning DYI home maintenance is not for everyone, but I sure have enjoyed it.  Being comfortable with so many aspects of my house is something I really like.\n\n          Breakers were design to be installed by the average Joe, as are drier legs. The failure mechanism of an improperly installed breaker is that it doesn&#x27;t work properly, or it gracefully melts in a metal box which is required by law&#x2F;code to handle that exact case of graceful melting and small plastic fires.<p>The tools and technique required for dealing with stack of little fire bombs, that explode if poked, bent, or overheated, sometimes at a much later date, while sitting in your garage&#x2F;living room, has a much more serious failure mechanism. And, more than that, most DIY battery packs I&#x27;ve seen involve lack of funds and Aliexpress cells. In the RC hobby community, everyone knows that you store DIY battery packs, especially those made with cheap Aliexpress cells, somewhere where they&#x27;re free to spontaneously combust without consequence.<p>Battery packs are scary. People who understand that have better outcomes [1] than people who don&#x27;t [2] (tbf, these are Lipo)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;fpv&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fb1u4d&#x2F;thanks_reddit_you_all_saved_my_house_from_burning&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;fpv&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fb1u4d&#x2F;thanks_reddit_y...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;fpv&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l1hegi&#x2F;psa_dont_leave_your_charging_lipos_unattended_my&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;fpv&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l1hegi&#x2F;psa_dont_leave_...</a>\n\n        Why yes, I do all my own electrical. Has saved me thousands and I am more careful about many parts of the process.\n\n      When there’s actually dangerous stuff under the hood, maybe we should worry about it though.  If piercing a cell with a screwdriver is going to cause a fire, and a runaway chain reaction could burn down your garage, maybe we should have a way to give mandatory training on how to handle things safely before you’re allowed to play under the hood.\n\n        Why is the cost greater than the benefit?\n\n          Because humans are bad at statistics, and don’t want to waste money on hypotheticals. “It’ll never happen to me.” So you can skimp on the cost of safety training.\n\n        &#x27;under the hood&#x27; is relative...<p>Most vehicles are Skateboard platform anyway; I feel like you&#x27;d already have to be in at least a semi-specialized shop to even get to where you can safely FAFO with the pack...<p>And frankly if a normal person manages to just &#x27;get one&#x27; and put it in their garage well I don&#x27;t know what to say aside from &#x27;sometimes natural selection has factors&#x27;...\n\n          I’d rather we be able to teach people so they’re safe when they experience the FO part of thermal runaway. Hey, I really needed that bucket of sand.<p>But I don’t control what other people are doing, so, like you said, natural selection. The problem comes when that garage is adjacent to the neighbors garage, and it catches from there, that we do need to control what other people are doing.\n\n      Also, what do people do in RVs in the desert?\n\n        What people should do is not have flammable batteries in a vehicle unless the whole system, the entire RV or EV, has been designed by experts. I built custom designed safe solar starlink campers as whole systems and make physics simulations and do extensive tests. That is how you prevent most battery fire in a car or off-grid tiny house in a desert.\n\n          Ok how about a gas powered RV, a highschool chemistry teacher, and one of his former students, Jesse. I think that&#x27;s enough expertise.\n\n      &gt; I&#x27;m skeptical of the idea that some repairs are meant to be performed only by &quot;experts&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re skeptical of this very banal notion than you are likely not qualified to be doing whatever work you&#x27;re doing. Yes, tons of technology is needlessly complicated and the salesmen and their compatriots in the &quot;no user serviceable parts inside&quot; sticker division have spent a lot of time and effort to convince people that the inside of electronic devices is sacrosanct; however that has led to an IMHO dangerous notion that <i>every</i> instance of someone saying &quot;hey, you really shouldn&#x27;t take this apart on your home bench&quot; is regarded with suspicion, or some notion of &quot;they just want you to buy a new one!&quot; and not that, sometimes things break and if they&#x27;re designed well, they may well have a failure mode that prevents a <i>much worse failure mode.</i><p>And it might be expertise that&#x27;s the dividing line, but it could just as easily be a matter of the material itself: that sometimes, what&#x27;s in there <i>is pretty fucking dangerous actually</i> and shouldn&#x27;t be messed with by just any old guy, even a technical guy, who has a YouTube tutorial. It might be that the parts inside failed <i>for a reason</i> and replacing them, while it makes whatever thing work again, might not actually be a great idea depending on <i>why the original ones failed</i> and that if you don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, blindly putting them back might be setting you up for something disastrous.<p>I&#x27;m 100% a believer in the right to repair, but I do not mean for that always to be <i>myself.</i> On the rare occasion I take something apart with lithium cells inside (which I avoid at all costs!), I handle them like live grenades and either re-connect them to whatever managing circuitry or, if whatever it is is beyond fixing, disposing of them safely. I don&#x27;t do this because I don&#x27;t understand them: I know intimately how they work. I do this <i>because</i> I understand them and respect the danger they pose, not unlike firearms or the parts of my car that I know I don&#x27;t know enough and am not qualified to fix.<p>Being intelligent is, IMO, oftentimes more about knowing what you <i>don&#x27;t know</i> and respecting that than knowing what you know.<p>And, as an aside just because it&#x27;s related to this point I&#x27;ve articulated: do not take apart lithium batteries in an apartment. I don&#x27;t give a shit what your qualifications are or how good your risk assessment might be, you do not have the right to take into your hands the safety of yourself and at the same time, <i>every other person currently occupying the structure you inhabit.</i> That is just not your risk to accept, full stop. You are not an island and all the high minded libertarian nonsense you can muster cannot get around the fact that if you make a mistake, no matter how benign in the moment, you could damn well set other people&#x27;s homes on fire with zero warning for them.\n\n        &gt; if you make a mistake<p>or if the battery is defective, or the power goes out and you&#x27;re stuck in the dark, or ...\n\n        The flip-side of this is that there are so many activities that people do all the time that carry risk. Plenty of them are not really necessary, and create some risk for other people, and yet they are perfectly acceptable.<p>A good  analogy is the use of candles. They are pointless and fundamentally dangerous, but some people like them. People who like them even think they are calming, which is a very bad reaction to an open flame from a risk-assessment point-of view.<p>If i knew my neighbour liked candles, i would hope that they are being safe and accept that they have a right to take socially-acceptable amounts of risk, not berate them on the internet.<p>I don&#x27;t see how repairing battery-containing electronics is any different. Both are unnecessary, and both could turn a small mistake into a fire.<p>So, I&#x27;m quite happy replacing my own phone battery with reasonable precautions, but no, friend, you may not charge your sketchy e-bike in my hallway.<p>The level of risk that is acceptable is socially defined, and far from the black-and-white view that some people seem to have.\n\n          &gt; So, I&#x27;m quite happy replacing my own phone battery with reasonable precautions, but no, friend, you may not charge your sketchy e-bike in my hallway.<p>Having myself witnessed a cell phone&#x27;s battery go up when it was nicked during a removal, I&#x27;ll take the candle a thousand times over one of those. But you know what you know.<p>Personally I just wouldn&#x27;t fuck with re-manufactured batteries at all. Batteries should be new, from licensed factories, and they should be recycled in a way akin to car batteries so we don&#x27;t lose all the lithium inside that&#x27;s still perfectly good for another go-round in a new battery.\n\n            Yeah, i know the risk, that was my point. Given the difference in frequency (say, ~every day vs. ~once a year) and level of attention, the risk to others is at least comparable.<p>Given how popular DIY phone battery replacement is, you&#x27;d expect there to be at least a few incidents reported if it was a major risk, but I just don&#x27;t see them. On the other hand london fire brigade reports 200 candle fires a year...\n\n        &gt; Being intelligent is, IMO, oftentimes more about knowing what you don&#x27;t know and respecting that than knowing what you know.<p>Someone once said &#x27;INT is knowing how to make an Atomic bomb. WIS is knowing the implications of actual use&#x27;\n\n      &gt; I&#x27;m skeptical of the idea that some repairs are meant to be performed only by &quot;experts&quot; and that nobody should ever try to learn how to make them.<p>That is a very dangerous point of view. Many things really are too dangerous and require too much expertise for you to do. That&#x27;s how and why expertise exists - it&#x27;s required to accomplish certain tasks. Not everything - not nearly everything - can be done by amatuers.<p>It&#x27;s dangerous to you and also to people around you. The flaming lithium ion cell can kill lots of other people, or leave them in horrible pain and permanently disfigured with burns, or destroy lifetimes of memory and property.<p>What will you tell them? &#x27;I thought I could do it&#x27;? Why did you try when everyone told you it was too dangerous? &#x27;...&#x27;<p>&gt; there is a manufacturing process that: welds cells together to make banks, and that sometimes produces a runaway reaction inside the cells. Given that that&#x27;s the case, it should be entirely possible to do that safely in a controlled environment inside of a garage.<p>Not unless you have millions of dollars invested in design (by experts trained and experienced in designing such facilities), equipment, and construction for your garage. And it&#x27;s not near any neighbors - they don&#x27;t put those factories in residential neighborhoods.\n\n        There are a few points to make here:<p>1) You need to understand how things work culturally in a country&#x2F;region. SE Asia in particular does not have the same concept of mandated safety like in the US or the EU. Which makes things easy.<p>2) People need to stop using &quot;domain expertise&quot; to gate-keep other people from doing something. Yeah, batteries can be dangerous, but that does not mean you need a highly qualified and expensive person to do something trivial, like welding batteries together. If we would have gone down this path, not Intel&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Google would have been born because Fairchild semiconductor had the expertise, IBM was making personal computers and everyone used Yahoo or AltaVista for search, so what would people without experience achieve, right?<p>When there are no alternatives or they are more expensive than DYI, DYI will always win in places like this. Do you think in Indonesia people have thousands of dollars to buy batteries like they do in other regions?\n\n          Computer boards might burn but it&#x27;s usually just a nuisance. Not so much for high energy batteries...\n\n            This is not as big of problem there as it might be in other places. Here, a video of how fuel is transported in other parts of the world (popped randomly on my feed): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vm.tiktok.com&#x2F;ZGePEvYU5&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vm.tiktok.com&#x2F;ZGePEvYU5&#x2F;</a>. It gets the job done, everything else matters very little to not at all.\n\n              Dead people, or living people with serious burns and lifelong disfigurement, or property loss - that &quot;matters very little to not at all&quot;?<p>If those things don&#x27;t matter, what does? Batteries?\n\n                In a lot of cultures people would rather die trying to save their house. And in many places, for example, people would rather die trying to get their luggage from an airplane in flames thn just running for their lives.<p>My point being that you should not see everything through “western” eyes where life is valued more over psysical possesions.<p>And to answer your question: yes, cheaper batteries matter more in Indonesia than “safe” batteries. And I am pretty sure the same holds for pretty much all of SE Asia.\n\n                  The talking point for every evil is to try paint any moral value as arbitrary and&#x2F;or &#x27;western&#x27;. It&#x27;s transparently ridiculous on a rational level, and furthers real evil, real harm to real people.<p>If you find yourself on that side of the debate, on that path, you&#x27;ve lost your way; you&#x27;ve followed the wrong people.\n\n        If you actually think commercially available battery packs are being produced in super high tech, super safe, quality-controlled factories by experts, you should try disassembling one.<p>You do not need millions of dollars of equipment to solder battery cells together. You probably need “expert” training, meaning, like, watching a YouTube video. This stuff is not complicated.\n\n          &gt; You do not need millions of dollars of equipment to solder battery cells together.<p>I have disassembled several. They&#x27;re all welded, not soldered.<p>Soldering will damage the cell. Improper welding will poke holes in the cell.<p>It&#x27;s not rocket science but as your own comment proves, basic research is required as well as some practice welding it a safe location.\n\n            I didn’t know soldering vs welding could damage cells, thanks for that! The battery packs I’ve built are all made from cells that have threaded terminal posts, because I don’t have a laser welder (which as I understand it is the tool that gets used for this most often).<p>I stand by my point though, because a laser welder is not particularly expensive or exotic equipment, you can safely operate one in a garage, and you can learn to use one effectively with a little bit of practice.<p>Attitudes like “IT’S DANGEROUS DON’T EVEN TRY IT” are silly, and lead to people having unwarranted fear about really basic, easy-to-understand technology.\n\n    I design big custom battery packs in car trailers or shipping containers for storing them outside of infrastructure. If the battery catches fire you can drag the trailer or shipping containers further away to let it burn out. Of course it gets harder to drag them away after a few minutes of fire when the axles and wheels start to melt.<p>The point is to never put Lithium-ion batteries inside buildings, especially not put them inside heavy (metal) boxes bolted to the building.\n\n      &gt; The point is to never put Lithium-ion batteries inside buildings<p>Missing word?<p>Because I have dozens of &#x27;em inside this building right now...\n\n      &gt; never put Lithium-ion batteries inside buildings<p>No EVs in garages or multi-storey car parks?\n\n        You will have to do some research to find out what the new laws in the making and fire department procedures say about garages and multi-story car parks in 2024.<p>A quick review by me just now suggests the government regulations still have not yet caught up with the new reality in the US and EU:<p>EV&#x27;s and large batteries inside buildings are not yet forbidden but probably will be soon.<p>Fire departments choose to evacuate a building with EV fires (and other industrial fires) and just let it burn out [2].<p>Fire departments only quench a fire by sudden rapid cooling if possible, for example by drowning [1] the entire Li-ion fire in a basin. Taking the oxygen away is not the goal.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ctif.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2023-03&#x2F;Putting%20out%20battery%20fires%20with%20water.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ctif.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2023-03&#x2F;Putting%20o...</a><p>I design neighbourhood batteries as two shipping containers underground.

That is, are you selling or even giving them to people?<p>I hope only you are at risk from these devices (and I hope you are safe too, but that&#x27;s your choice). Untested technology can&#x27;t be depended on. As a rule I don&#x27;t believe anything works unless I see it with my own eyes - if I swap in a new patch cable, I ping something. Safety equipment for mortal risks is on a different level.\n\n                Sounds like a sound design to me. If he gets sued at least he can argue he did everything reasonable to prevent and quench a battery fire. That&#x27;s how gen 4 nuclear power stations are designed to cool the core in the event of a loss of coolant incident. The other way is to use LiFePo chemistry which doesn&#x27;t ignite like LiIon but has half the capacity.\n\n                  &gt; Sounds like a sound design to me.

That would more than inconvenience millions of people who already have such things.  Seems most unlikely to me.  Here in Norway we have about half a million EVs many of which are parked in private garages overnight and in multistorey car parks during the day.  I can&#x27;t recall a single incident where the battery either caused or exacerbated a problem.\n\n          EVblog 1422 - CAUSE of the Tesla Victoria Big Battery Fire <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oknr1OaqnUE&amp;t=1178s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oknr1OaqnUE&amp;t=1178s</a><p>Report: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cityfire.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;VBB_StatementOfFindings_FINAL_28Sep2021.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cityfire.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;VBB_Statemen...</a>\n\n            The conclusion is very encouraging!<p>&gt; The affected Megapacks failed safely despite total loss.\n\n    &gt;Before doing that, try watching some experiments with fireproof containers specifically designed for these fires<p>I watched a bunch of those videos on YouTube when I was in the market for one and ended up not buying any.  The ones that were fully sealed just exploded and the ones that were vented shot 3 foot tall flames and showers of sparks out of the vents igniting everything on the ground around the container.  Better to just charge the bike outside on pavement or concrete away from anything flammable.\n\n  &gt; Note that while the article says &quot;soldering&quot; the pictures show &quot;welding&quot;,<p>In some languages, these are the same word (this is the case at least for my native Portuguese), so this could just be a translation issue.\n\n    Wait what? Is there a distinction for Brazing? There isn&#x27;t a distinction for the same metals vs different ones?\n\n      How about glueing? After all, two parts are held together by application of a different substance.\n\n    They&#x27;re also more or less synonymous in Chinese, resulting in a lot of weird phrases like &quot;infrared welding&quot; or &quot;SMT welding practice kit&quot;.\n\n    Interesting: How do you express the difference between soldering and welding?\n\n      Welding melts the metal to be joined, and joins it with a fillet of the same material.<p>Soldering does not melt the parts to be joined, it just melts the solder, at a much lower temperature.<p>Brazing is the midpoint of these: joining with dissimilar metal, without melting the parts to be joined, but at a relatively high temperature.\n\n        The GGP said the words for welding and soldering are the same in Portugese. I was asking how people express the difference in Portugese.\n\n    They&#x27;re distinct in Indonesian, the former is &quot;solder&quot; while the latter is &quot;las&quot;. Most likely a technical assumption made by the author during his visit to the workshop\n\n  &gt; Be careful if it smells like birthday cake when you&#x27;re working with lion cells<p>This is hilariously specific. I wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe that sweet smell of li-ion packs immolating. Birthday cake seems to fit it perfectly.\n\n    Ah, Mom&#x27;s good old lithium birthday cakes ...\n\n  The birthday cake smell thing is right on, happened to me. I was transporting a hobby fighting robot and noticed the smell. When I took it out of the metal box I found a wire had broken and the 18650 battery was shorted.\n\n  In addition to the heat issue, a lot of battery contacts don&#x27;t form a good joint with typical electrical solder.<p>Source: Tried to solder batteries.\n\n  Interesting.  My father (retired engineer into these things) was talking about making a battery pack welder recently.<p>Something about it using a directed microwave pulse to make the weld spot, so it doesn&#x27;t dump a bunch of heat into the batteries and potentially cause a fire.<p>The theory of it sounded ok to my layman ears.  Hopefully he gets it up and working in the near future. :)\n\nI cant wait for outfits like this to pop up in the states. I have a couple of battery packs that are dead and I do not have the time or patience to rebuild. They are gonna go to CL free, but I looked for local services that can rebuild them.<p>As more battery packs begin to fail this will become the norm.\n\n  They do exist.<p>Off the top of my head Tenergy is one that operates in the states, but there&#x27;s tons of them out there.\n\n    I can imagine indonesia&#x27;s low wages supporting manual labor to rebuild these battery packs, but in the US or Europe surely the cost of such labor precludes such labor, or otherwise requires more automated methods?\n\nI have no idea what the fascination with this is, and what makes these batteries &quot;homemade&quot;.. also, it&#x27;s spotwelding and not soldering.<p>Buying battery cells and spot welding them together is a thing that many companies do, even in the &quot;western world&quot;, i know of at least three in my small eu country.<p>Before lithium, they did the same with NiMh and NiCd batteries.<p>You can also make them yourself at home, although it can get relatively dangerous if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing... same as with replacing an outlet at home, but more of a fire damage instead of a shock risk, so definitely not for everyone, but with some basic precautions, can be done safely.<p>The bigger problem in the current times is, that device manufacturers fight hard against any kind of repair or DIY stuff, so sometimes just disconnecting the cells from the BMS (battery management system) makes it &quot;reset&quot; and fail the &quot;authenticatioN&quot; between the device and the BMS (which exists only to prevent repair). Companies know how to avoid that (via using a power supply to keep the board powered up), but attempting to DIY fix it (without knowing about the issue) makes you destroy the BMS.\n\n  Is this really a common practice outside of FutureMotion&#x2F;OneWheel?\n\n    Bosch is known to pair their hardware such that you can’t replace a bad element, e.g. replace a bad Bosch battery with a 3rd party unit. The entire Bosch ebike hardware ecosystem is locked down and only approved dealers can repair.\n\n    It’s pretty common. They’re far from the first ones to have started that practice, which began in the 2000s. The concept of the battery management system (BMS) killing the pack for safety reasons came with modern BMS chips that can do state of health (SoH) measuring, along with state of charge (SoC) measuring.\n\n    Some laptop manufacturers do that... once you disconnect the voltage from the BMS, the BMS is efectively dead. If you know it, you can use a power supply to keep it energized, if not, tough luck. You can still buy a 3rd party battery to use with that laptop, but the original laptop cannot be &quot;renewed&quot; with new cells anymore.\n\n  They are even matching the internal resistance of the cells, I can&#x27;t think of much more a professional manufacturer would be doing. As long as they are getting their cells from reputable sources (big if) I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with a boutique battery industry for niche applications.\n\n    A professional manufacturer would not put any cell in series but instead would have a charger&#x2F;discharger with voltage per cell, with current and temperature sensors as feedback loops.\nThe danger of cells in series differs with the cell chemistries.<p>Using a BMS is another indication they are not professional or even had an engineer design them.<p>Sadly I know of only a very few small professional battery pack manufacturers, certainly none of the EV or bike makers.\n\n      &gt; Using a BMS is another indication they are not professional or even had an engineer design them.<p>What is the proper alternative?  Do any ebike packs conform to the standard you expect?\n\n      By &quot;series&quot; do you mean &quot;parallel&quot;?<p>Note that Tesla famously used a 6-series&#x2F;74-parallel configuration in the Model S&#x27;s battery pack: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circuitdigest.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;tesla-model-s-battery-system-an-engineers-perspective\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circuitdigest.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;tesla-model-s-battery-syst...</a><p>Each pack only had a single BMS connection for every clump of 74 cells! Presumably they only got away with doing this by doing extensive binning&#x2F;characterization of the cells before building them into packs.\n\n      &gt; A professional manufacturer would not put any cell in series but instead would have a charger&#x2F;discharger with voltage per cell<p>My Bosch e-bike has 4 cells in parallel and put 10 of those in series. This so called 10S4P is a very typical setup for e-bikes. Each individual cell does definitely not have their own current&#x2F;temp sensor. The BMS will check voltage for each of the 4 cell blocks.\n\n    &gt; I can&#x27;t think of much more a professional manufacturer would be doing<p>Safety equipment, in a safe environment, not exposing others to fire risk?\n\n  I would define &quot;homemade&quot; as assembling the batteries without any sort of regulation or safety standards.<p>I&#x27;d be a bit frightened if I knew someone in my apartment building was assembling their own batteries -- poor quality ones can burn down the building.<p>It&#x27;s an increasing problem here in San Francisco. I know at least one friend who had to move due to smoke damage caused by a neighbor collecting these batteries.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfstandard.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;san-francisco-e-scooter-bike-battery-fires-legislation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfstandard.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;san-francisco-e-scooter-bi...</a>\n\n    Yeah this is incredibly dangerous. It&#x27;s not at all like installing a power outlet. You can do that relatively easily and safely. These batteries will catch fire in the middle of the night, burning down apartments and they will kill many people.\n\n      So can store bought: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JCaDz_2YcGQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JCaDz_2YcGQ</a><p>So can galaxy notes, hoverboards, vapes, etc. So can poor electical installations, bridged fuses, cooking oil fires, etc.<p>These packs (18650 based) are a lot safer than &quot;baggied&quot; packs found in many fpv drones and RC cars, and those packs are factory assembled.<p>Firewise, i&#x27;m more afraid of an alcoholic with a cigarette, than of batteries.\n\n    What I find concerning is most people here would have seen expanded seams on a phone or laptop and known about the &quot;puffy&quot; battery within.<p>The rate of proliferation of gadgets with such batteries is crazy. So much of society <i>already has</i> so many of these little flashpoints in phones, tablets, toothbrushes, kids toys (electric scooter anyone?) - statistically your concerns are already valid without anyone being an electronics hobbyist.\n\n    So, compare the number of battery fires to eg. gas explosions, cigarette fires, oil fires due to cooking, etc.<p>Doing anything with mains power, water pipes and gas pipes is still done by many people themselves, and the risk is minimal.<p>Also most of the battery fires happened with factory installed batteries, be it in vapes, galaxy notes, or other devices.<p>Also: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JCaDz_2YcGQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JCaDz_2YcGQ</a>\n\n  &gt; same as with replacing an outlet at home, but more of a fire damage instead of a shock risk<p>Not a good comparison at all. The battery can burn down the entire building and kill everyone in it - or just burn them alive and leave them breathing. Don&#x27;t forget all their property.<p>Your wall outlet will just knock you on your butt, afaik.\n\n  There&#x27;s a fair bit of design, validation, and certification that goes into making sure a pack is safe.  The spot welding and wrapping is just the final result.<p>Thermal design to make sure the pack doesnt overheat under normal conditions.  There&#x27;s the mechanical side to make sure that the pack can survive shock and vibe.<p>Getting packs certified to UN38.3 or IEC62133 are no small feats.  Unsurprisingly, the certification process is not cheap.  For 62133, we had to provide a ton of samples.\n\n  &gt; You can also make them yourself at home, although it can get relatively dangerous if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing... same as with replacing an outlet at home, but more of a fire damage instead of a shock risk, so definitely not for everyone, but with some basic precautions, can be done safely.<p>Did that for my semi-diy bike. Got an older Sparta with stupid DRM in it, removed all the sparta parts, made a custom PCB for the motor&#x2F;hall sensors and had the NiMH battery replaced it with a custom 7s9p pack (in frame so was limited in options) resulting in a nice 650Wh battery instead of the 200Wh it used to have. Using recycled cells from a crashed scooter resulted in a (relatively) cheap, reused ebike.\n\nLove to see something of a standard e-bike battery. Perhaps there is one in Southeast Asian markets....<p>Something roughly a liter, liter and a half in size. A standard, perhaps twist connector on the bottom. Various bike configs could incorporate a handful of these in locations that make sense for their bikes — the number of packs reflecting the range or torque requirements.<p>With a standard you could swap packs, get the cost benefits of scale...\n\n  You see this in Taiwan a lot already - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;gogoro-batteries-power-90-of-taiwans-electric-scooters&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;gogoro-batteries-power-...</a><p>Standardized packs for low-end ebikes would be wonderful.\n\n    Those are for scooters though, not ebikes.\n\n      What&#x27;s the difference and what is your point? They are 48v nominal lithium batteries.\n\n      Asia has standardise electric shooters while here, in the financial centre of Europe, we have dusty, noisy petrol guzzling bikes used for delivery. Have we fallen behind but we still think we are ahead? It&#x27;s going to take another 10 years for any kind of standardisation to happen here\n\n    I wonder if we can get those in the U.S. It doesn&#x27;t look like that&#x27;s the point though. They seem to sell the infrastructure, the batteries are part of it.\n\nThe article goes to great pains to emphasize how concerning this is and how much of a safety risk it is seemingly without finding a single actual incident where the independent battery builders&#x27; batteries caused a problem. Frankly, given the level of quality control I&#x27;ve seen from large brands lately, I&#x27;m skeptical that the guy who&#x27;s made it his business to build batteries for the last 20 years is delivering a worse product than what I&#x27;d get buying retail.\n\nMore of this please!<p>It&#x27;s astonishing how anti-modular various industries are.  Even batteries, which for all their &quot;oh no gonna blow&quot; are really quite simple components.  But why are cars not modular?  How about HVAC?  Housing is pretty modular.\n\n  These home made ebike batteries regularly catch fire and burn down apartments. Quite a lot of apartments in Australia are banning taking ebikes inside now.\n\n    Regularly?  That means that some nontrivial fraction are guaranteed to burn.  I think you mean that it happens at low probability but is eagerly covered by media.<p>In any case, the fault is almost certainly either physical abuse (which has nothing to do with accessibility&#x2F;modularity) or simply bad chargers (which better access would actually mitigate).\n\nRelevant: &quot;Louis&#x27; front door goes BOOM courtesy of UnitPackPower battery&quot;  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JCaDz_2YcGQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JCaDz_2YcGQ</a><p>Lithium Ion (and especially LiPo) are not to be trifled with, small things might matter (such as whether the battery is under mechanical stress, dented or bent). I would never want a large battery from a non-reputable supplier around my home.\n\nThis is just a hit piece from someone in the battery industry.<p>The dead giveaway the author has been in the battery industry for a long time is this: \n&gt; Packers often use 18650 lithium-ion cells — essentially a larger, rechargeable version of a standard flashlight battery.<p>Then calling a group of people &quot;packers&quot; shows the author wants to label and dehumanize then.\n\nComments in this thread are hilarious. Making battery packs by connecting cells together is neither difficult nor especially dangerous. It’s soldering. Sometimes you’re just connecting wires to terminals. Anyone can do this. It’s not a big deal.\n\nthose in the diy space are very well aware about assembling your own batteries as mentioned by others.<p>their approach does not seem too different from the norm, but it is interesting to see it happen at commercial level. from an economic standpoint, the countries producing commodity cells can stand to benefit a lot from cottage industries like this to increase electric mobility.\n\nIn other headlines: “Tech worker builds batteries in his own room after work”<p>This is just assembling cells, not building a battery from scratch.\n\nIt’s not just fire but explosion as well with bad battery packs. Some years ago some friend bought a “comparable” laptop battery off eBay for an older laptop. They were charging it one day and battery exploded. Fortunately they were not sitting in front of it. I was in the office when my friend got the call from his wife and asked me to come look at the computer. We arrived with smoke in the room and little fires burning in different corners of the room with a scorch mark on the desk and the laptop in the middle of the floor with smoke wafting out of it.  I dug some charred plastic out of the battery compartment and hooked it up to external power and it booted ok. \nBe safe out there kids."

      "conversation_text": "Well, this sure seems like an ad. Anyone actually use it? Probably not going to sway me away from KiCAD even for a moment.\n\n  Their offering is a CAD tool plugin, not a freestanding CAD tool.\n\n    Thank you for this comment! Would you pretty please help me debug my website - what makes JITX seem like a CAD plugin?<p>(it is a freestanding tool)\n\n      The pricing page lists a bunch of CAD “integrations”, which aren’t mentioned on the home page, so maybe that’s confusingly implying that you need at least one CAD integration?\n\n        Right - &quot;none of the other tools try to integrate nicely, so if we support it well it must be necessary&quot; is the thought to address.\n\n      Because all of your screenshots look like the standard Altium SCH and PCB symbol formats and color themes.<p>The integrations that the other reply mentioned also threw me. I was excited by the “Kicad integration” checkmark. I don’t like the term “power user” but I have done a lot more with Kicad than most folks I know, and I don’t really want to go thru another EECAD learning curve.\n\n      Even after seeing this comment, I thought it was a CAD plugin as well.<p>I think the main thing is that there is no screenshot of the entire UI or window of the program on your website. It looks like there&#x27;s some VSCode and as others mention, other CAD software styles, leading to the impression that this is a plugin that you use alongside other things.<p>The nature of the tool itself is another reason. It claims compatibility on the pricing page with various tools and says something along the lines of you can use your existing tools to finalize placement and routing, leading the user to think it&#x27;s a plugin that automates some of it.<p>I would suggest putting a more prominent link to your FAQ (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jitx.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;faq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jitx.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;faq</a>) along with updating it with more information in it.<p>Separately to this, I think it would be nice to have a more complex (more parts, some power and mixed signal elements) design on the website that users can easily browse and evaluate (view layout, schematic, animation&#x2F;timelapse of design process), so that users can more easily visualize how it might work for an actual project. It seems like many of the examples are fairly simple currently but the power supply TPS chip is fine.\n\n        Thanks for the feedback -- very helpful.\n\n      Even the FAQ page that other comments linked repeats multiple times &quot;quickly iterate on designs, and then use existing CAD tools to finalize placement, routing&quot;.<p>If this was a fully featured freestanding CAD tool, you wouldn&#x27;t need to do any finalizing of placement or routing in real CAD software, the final step would be directly exporting gerbers for manufacturing. Exporting to other CAD software would be only necessary for migrating design away from JITX.<p>With how prominently the description mentions exporting to other CAD software, makes it sound like JITX lacks some essential parts of ECAD software, meaning that most users will want to export and do parts of work in &quot;real&quot; ECAD software.<p>Can you fully complete most projects at professional level without using other ECAD software? Using other software for some specific tasks like simulation or testing is fine. I am talking only about parts which you expect to be included in most PCB design software.\n\n        Welp - seems there are out of date parts of the website. We launched router last Tuesday so have to update that we are end to end now. Thanks for the pointer!\n\nThere are so many different tools to help design and route PCBs now. You have DeepPCB, Flux, and Quilter doing auto-routing, and SKiDL, CuFlow, and JITX doing programmatic schematics (and also sometimes auto-routing?).<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t really understand how these tools are differentiated from one another. I personally know the Quilter guys, so if I had to pick I&#x27;d use their product, but I don&#x27;t think the market crowding here is great for anybody.\n\n  &gt; I don&#x27;t think the market crowding here is great for anybody.<p>In the end, the users will win from this crowding, I suppose.\n\n    &gt;In the end, the users will win from this crowding, I suppose.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about that. A while ago I was really excited about Altium introducing CircuitStudio (the first iteration, I think they have a new product with the same name that&#x27;s completely different). CircuitStudio was pitched as Altium-lite. I paid, I believe, $3000 for it (with some kind of maintenance license?) and absolutely loved it. A year or so later they reached out to me to let me know that they were changing their licensing costs to $900&#x2F;year or something like that and that they wanted to reward me as an early adopter by giving me a lifetime license.<p>But... the product didn&#x27;t, as far as I can tell, ever get enough traction to actually become a long-term-viable product. Eagle, at the time, was I think $1000 for a professional license (way before Autodesk bought Eagle). CircuitStudio was, to me, a dramatically better product than Eagle. But where I&#x27;ve ended up with this... I have a perpetual license for a product that stopped getting updates years ago. No one I work with has software that&#x27;s compatible with it and they can&#x27;t just buy a license. It&#x27;s a total albatross that I keep around essentially so that I can open my old designs.<p>New designs? They&#x27;re in KiCAD now. While I really don&#x27;t love KiCAD, no one&#x27;s going to pull the rug out from under me. I can share designs with clients &amp; colleagues and they can open them and work with them. 10 years from now I&#x27;ll be able to, worst case scenario, run Ubuntu 20.04 in a VM with KiCAD 7 and open the designs (that&#x27;s assuming KiCAD 37 in 2034 doesn&#x27;t still have backwards compatibility support :)).<p>Cloud-based ECAD scares me even more. A year or two ago I needed to debug an issue with a super old design for a client. The schematic and board layouts were done in Protel 99SE (Altium Designer before it became Altium). I installed it, opened the design no problem, and extracted the info I needed. Will JITX still be around in 25 years? If they go out of business... what happens to all of my designs? Exporting to PDF and Gerbers is an OK step but doesn&#x27;t help me at all if I need to actually interact with the design.<p>A crowded market is great for downward pressure on price, but it&#x27;s really not great for companies to survive long-term in a relatively small niche market.\n\n      As the PCB manufacturing industry becomes more accessible to hobbyists and junior engineers through services like JLCPCB and PCBWay, KiCad, despite its limitations compared to professional tools, is gaining popularity. While experienced PCB designers may not prefer KiCad over their professional-grade software, the growing adoption of KiCad by hobbyists and entry-level engineers could lead to its increased presence in the professional sphere as these users progress in their careers and bring their tool preferences with them.\n\n      FYI, KiCAD explicitly guarantees that old designs will always be readable by all future versions.\n\n      &gt; New designs? They&#x27;re in KiCAD now. While I really don&#x27;t love KiCAD, no one&#x27;s going to pull the rug out from under me.<p>I took a different path, but we have arrived in the same place.<p>I have a coupe kicad gripes, but there is no doubt it is getting better all the time…. And for free.\n\n  Flux founder here<p>Our mission is to take the “hard” out of hardware<p>We have 240k users on the platform…hobbyists, students, small&#x2F;mid sized teams to Fortune50 companies. We host millions of projects!<p>It’s a huge ecosystem not just of users but also semiconductor manufacturers, fab houses, etc.<p>Think GitHub on steroids!<p>And it’s the only AI first end-to-end design tool in the market…you can go from idea to research to architecture to BOM to schematic to PCB layout and then to manufacturing. Workflows that usually take months in other tools can be done in a few hours to minutes in flux.<p>It’s still early days though but we are moving insanely fast! So if we don’t met your teams bar today I suggest checking back in next month.<p>I think it’s good for more players to enter the market…EDA tooling is stuck somewhere in the 80s and we need to fix that.<p>It’s too expensive and risky to make hardware…and we deserve better!\n\nPerhaps related to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39263854\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39263854</a> ?<p>Or to save a click: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;atopile&#x2F;atopile\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;atopile&#x2F;atopile</a><p>I&#x27;m a hobbyist PCB designer, and a hobbyist (and generally happy) openSCAD user, with the BOSL2 library, and a hobbyist ESPHome user and I would really love some code alternative to KiCad.<p>It also sounds like maybe I have too many hobbies.\n\n  That&#x27;s not nearly enough hobbies. Try making&#x2F;flying RC planes&#x2F;drones, it&#x27;s super fun and neatly combines with your other hobbies.\n\nThis looks interesting, as a hobbyist with a EEE background and a programming career I like the idea of designing circuits using code.<p>But maybe I&#x27;m not the target audience here... pricing seems high for anyone who is not using this commercially (and at scale).  $1000 per month (or $60 a day, which I don&#x27;t really understand the utility of).\n\n  Their yearly option is only 18% off too, at $9,804.\n\n    Sigh, remembers when Visual Age for Java was $10k a seat in 2000 $$$.\n\n  We are certainly focused on the professional market for monetization -- turns out this software is hard to build and we need to pay smart people to work on it.<p>Not to say we won&#x27;t have an open free&#x2F;freemium offering soon. Hobbyists needed the new layout tool we just shipped last Tuesday, so it&#x27;s much closer now.\n\n    The pricing page does list a free educational (“and open source”) offering. The application form only talks about educational, though. Can you say more about what that is?\n\n      Good catch - we can add some clarification to that form.<p>Today JITX is for professional EEs mainly, and we don&#x27;t have a lot of resources to help people learn electronics from scratch. (Still want to help the students though - this company was inspired by my grad school robotics struggles).<p>However a code-based approach boosts reusability enough make open-source hardware a whole lot more meaningful. So we selectively grant access to people able to use the tool effectively today who are also going to contribute to open source.<p>Overall, we&#x27;re opening up more and more as the tech moves from special purpose to general purpose.\n\n    I’m not in your target market at this point, but in the 3D CAD space, I’ve noticed that several companies have gone with free licensing for non-commercial use, and those tools end up getting practically all of the of exposure in the maker niches on YouTube.<p>It seems like a smart — if long term — strategy, since today’s young hobbyists are likely going to be a significant number of tomorrow’s founders, choosing the software their companies use.<p>It is admittedly a little different. Hobbyists getting into 3D printing are surely more common than hobbyists designing and ordering PCBs. But the latter is more accessible to low volume customers than it’s ever been.\n\n      &gt; It seems like a smart — if long term — strategy, since today’s young hobbyists are likely going to be a significant number of tomorrow’s founders, choosing the software their companies use.<p>The same argument is made for student licenses.<p>My life experience is different: people who love to learn about topics where such expensive software is commonly used very commonly don&#x27;t get a job in the respective industry, or at least don&#x27;t get a position where they can choose the software that the company uses. To put it somewhat polemically: people who love to learn all the time are often nerds; these people typically don&#x27;t end in management positions where they can buy software for the company.<p>Also, highly smart people often learn about very different things (e.g. software for 3D graphics and PCB design), but there is hardly any industry&#x2F;departmentment where software from very different areas is used.<p>In other words: the whole argument &quot;today’s hobbyists&#x2F;students will in the future choosing the software their companies use&quot; does in my opinion not hold. Better respect that hobbyists&#x2F;students form a very passionate user base that is typically rather disjoint with the (less passionate) commercial customers.\n\n        I would split hobbyists and students.<p>Students become professionals and DO make choices. I&#x27;ve seen more than one CAD company succeed primarily by courting universities. Indeed, Apple for a long time dominated graphic design mostly due to its education programs.<p>Within hobbyists &#x2F; nerds, there are also two general categories:<p>- Ones who do this on the side<p>- Ones who do this as part of a job, but in a different industry<p>For example, a biologist might tinker in writing medical software or designing some kind of lab instrumentation. Those often do turn into commercial products. The PCB is often almost incidental, but if it&#x27;s in a particular tool, it&#x27;s very unlikely to ever be ported out.<p>Of course, that leads to O(1) license, whereas an EE shop will have O(n) licenses with the number of people they employ. But it does lead to sales.<p>Joel had a nice article on pricing:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;12&#x2F;15&#x2F;camels-and-rubber-duckies&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;12&#x2F;15&#x2F;camels-and-rubber-...</a><p>The basic upside is giving your stuff away to students and hobbyists costs O(nothing), if you can differentiate in a way which doesn&#x27;t let paid users not pay.\n\n          &gt; \nStudents become professionals and DO make choices.<p>Counterexample: me. :-)<p>As a student, I had access to some specialized mathematical software. I would <i>like</i> to use them at work, but I now work in a very different industry.\n\n        The management types, if they are even mildly competent, will look at what software the skilled employees they want are using, and then go with that.\n\n          It depends. Often very skilled software developers have a somewhat unusual &quot;taste&quot; regarding the software that they prefer to use ...\n\n    My advice would be to have two versions:<p>- Paid, which supports private designs.<p>- Free, where every design is open-licensed and discoverable.<p>There are approximately zero companies which will want their IP open. On the other hand, this makes this available to approximately 100% of the university and hobbyist market.<p>Don&#x27;t cripple the free version in any way beyond that.<p>The one lesson I learned watching CAD and other professional markets for decades: You want your tool used in university classes. Heck, if there weren&#x27;t conflicts-of-interest, it&#x27;d be worth paying universities to adopt your tool.<p>Hobbyists are less important (although there have been many examples of hobbyist projects turning into major companies).\n\n      That&#x27;s a fantastic suggestion, blagie! I really like how requiring open licenses  increases the marketing reach of the tool.\n\n      Does this create a problem if schools prevent students from posting their projects publicly (because it would allow other students to &quot;cheat&quot; and look at previous students&#x27; solutions), and such projects are no longer considered open-licensed here?\n\n        I&#x27;m pretty sure the product is already &quot;paid&quot; if you have a .edu email.\n\n      This is the classic SaaS CAD tool approach. But JITX runs locally - all design data stays local and we&#x27;re not holding it hostage in our cloud.<p>Definitely agree with a free version though - we want to help those just starting out as well! But they needed the support from the router we just shipped so earlier offerings would have fallen a bit flat. In the cards now though...\n\n        <i>shurg</i> Make a free version which keeps all data locally AND uploads a copy to your cloud (at least for internet-connected machines). Upsides:<p>- Marketing &#x2F; visibility: You&#x27;re a repository of free designs<p>- Network effects: If people want to reuse designs, they will standardize on your tool<p>- Training data. Want to know a pin on a given chip is SCK or 3.3V? Or which pins, by default, to connect between a USB chip to program a microcontroller? That&#x27;s in your library.<p>- Component library. If I make a footprint, Spice model, and 3d model for some part, you can get it for free for use by paying customers.<p>- ...<p>Yes, it can be circumvented. But the truth is 75% of businesses won&#x27;t break your license anyway. Some will (and there&#x27;s an obsession with dongles and what not), but those are mostly tiny fly-by-night operations which aren&#x27;t likely to buy a $12k license anyway.<p>It is a lot of work, and I&#x27;m not advocating for where this should fit on your priority list, or how much is needed in an MVP. Just that you should consider this as perhaps the right long-term model.\n\n    &gt;<i>turns out this software is hard to build and we need to pay smart people to work on it.</i><p>Well, I&#x27;m reasonably smart (math PhD, FAANG experience, etc), and I  interviewed with you a couple of years ago.<p>Went through all technical rounds, didn&#x27;t get the job.<p>I&#x27;ve spent some time with Meta since then, and made enough money that pay isn&#x27;t a priority for me now. Especially for a project like this that I both believe in, and see as a great fit for my background.<p>I&#x27;m looking for the next move now, and I still would love to be with JITX.<p>Pay me less. Let me help you being your vision to reality.\n\n    &gt; turns out this software is hard to build and we need to pay smart people to work on it.<p>This makes no sense, plenty of very hard things target B2C &#x2F; freemium. It&#x27;s perfectly fine if that isn&#x27;t your business model, but explaining it like this is not useful. Look at OpenAI for example, are they only paying cheap salaries since their plans are either free or $20?\n\n    Concentrating on the professional market is a perfectly valid business model.  I would assume you either need a completely compelling and unique product that is a no-brainer for those companies, or a good marketing team to break you into businesses with existing and entrenched tooling.\n\n  So <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BerkeleyHCI&#x2F;PolymorphicBlocks?tab=readme-ov-file\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BerkeleyHCI&#x2F;PolymorphicBlocks?tab=readme-...</a> may be of interest to you.<p>It&#x27;s ok, I did play with it a bit but the tooling was a bit of a pain to get set up. Not going to be as polished but it&#x27;s not $1000&#x2F;mo either.<p>(It looks like JITX is handling layout and PB is dealing with the netlist side, but it&#x27;s in the same space)\n\n  Paying $60 a day could a good way to give a contractor &#x2F; expert &#x2F; collaborator temporary access to your design to help solve a specific issue.\n\n    Or, I can keep using KiCAD and have my contractors work on it for no extra cost.\n\nCommercial license is $1000&#x2F;month. How does that compare to other EDA software?\n\n  Altium is about $10k to start and then $2.5k ~ 3.5k per year depending on plan.\n\n    My favorite is the hobbyist youtube videos sponsored by Altium.  Just pay 10k plus 2&#x2F;3k per year afterwards and you too can design boards like I can!  (&#x2F;s)<p>But the reality is I unsubscribed from those creators, because I never want to see someone design a board in Altium, I want to see how they build a board using kicad.<p>From the software side, I really like the license model of the all products pack from JetBrains.  And it goes with me wherever I go.\n\n      Yeah, I love the fact that Jetbrains &#x27;everything&#x27; is actually affordable by a solo software engineer and you can just &#x27;bring your own tools&#x27; to a job.\n\n    Altium is sufficiently good [1] though that for a personal license, you don&#x27;t really need the yearly updates (which are mainly focused on their core business of large companies anyway). Source: bought permanent license, haven&#x27;t update it.<p>[1] for example it has a built-in field solver for diff-pair impedance, not the approximations that vary from online tool to online tool\n\n  KiCad is free and has a great community, which means lots of projects to download.\n\n    And lots of people who can provide support. And lots of youtube tutorials.\n\n  It&#x27;s probably changed, Cadence software used to have a on-site person colocated out at my dad&#x27;s office just to support it day to day.\n\n    Cadence is a whole different beast entirely. My job buys something like 20 seats of SPECTRE a year, among other tools, and EDA licenses are our #1 spending item, above workforce.\n\n  &gt; Dedicated to solving difficult problems with huge impact, our first step is to automate circuit board design.<p>I would say it doesn&#x27;t compare.\n\nI have to give JITX credit - every time I see their latest product offering, it gets closer to something I’d actually use. (Working EE who primarily does board and system design.)<p>These layout automations they show in the landing page are the first thing they’ve showcased that I’m intrigued enough to want to try for myself.<p>The thing I wonder about with all of these EDA companies is whether any of them understand that they’re not attacking the biggest problem of circuit design.<p>Capturing the SCH&#x2F;PCB is a relatively small part of the process of getting a working design ready to sell. Less than ten percent of the time, I’d guess. The bulk goes in to design documentation, testing, certification, compliance, and DFM&#x2F;DFA.<p>A part of me sort of hates to see these companies do their thing, because it’s making the fun part of the job shorter and faster.\n\n  Thanks! We&#x27;re working hard -- I just added that animation this morning and I have a few more to do.<p>I like your perspective on tackling the biggest problem. We can show a lot more of how users have been doing automation for firmware, docs, testing, etc ...<p>An underrated part of an autorouter is that you can enforce rules for DFM (and SI) automatically, so some of that tougher stuff is addressable with the right approach. Including a lot of compliance.<p>Certainly not trying to shrink the fun part - tried to make layout more of an optimization tool than a drafting tool. Although &quot;I should not be doing this&quot; is a mentality a lot of EEs bring to layout.\n\n    <i>I like your perspective on tackling the biggest problem</i><p>I’d be happy to generate some additional perspectives on your tool if there’s a way I can try it without spending $10k or going back to college for an .edu email address XD<p><i>An underrated part of an autorouter is that you can enforce rules for DFM (and SI) automatically, so some of that tougher stuff is addressable with the right approach. Including a lot of compliance.</i><p>You must be referring to an autorouter tool I’ve never tried. (Maybe your own?) All the ones I’ve ever seen produce trace fanouts that look like regurgitated spaghetti.<p><i>&quot;I should not be doing this&quot; is a mentality a lot of EEs bring to layout.</i><p>Probably explains why so many EEs struggle to get their designs to pass radiated emissions compliance tests. Layout is still circuit design: you just don’t know any of the component values you’re dealing with. Gotta learn to make good choices once you understand how board parasitics work.<p>Unrelated - I’m pretty sure I spoke with you or one of your cofounders about your product in comments when you first launched. I asked you about emissions compliance and I think DDR trace matching and routing in a comment thread. Glad to see you got at least one of those problems licked.\n\n      I like phrasing layout as circuit design\n\n        Technically it is, all the components on a PCB are connected together with bundles of resistors, inductors, capacitors, and antennas that we simplify into something called a &quot;trace&quot;.\n\n    I’ve never understood layout as being secondary. The artwork matters a great deal ensuring the design works and works well.\n\n    Also - as a side note - everyone in this comment thread kvetching about your tool’s price clearly doesn’t understand:<p>1) the value a good EE design brings to an organization, or<p>2) the amount of money selling electronics is worth to a company<p>You have to feed yourselves and your employees, and all the companies who really need this tool are ones that have no problem spending 10k per year to make their engineers more effective. (Thinking of Lockheed Martin here as they’re one of your flagship customers.)<p>The average Kicad hobbiest wants this, but doesn’t <i>need</i> it. At least, not in the same way someone with a boss, a program manager, a deadline, and four projects to support does.\n\n      &gt; The average Kicad hobbiest wants this, but doesn’t need it. At least, not in the same way someone with a boss, a program manager, a deadline, and four projects to support does.<p>Yeah, but they&#x27;re also never going to pay for it (or not anything close to this price) in a personal capacity.<p>So give it away free like for current students (would I get away with an alumni^ address I wondered) and generate hype, Youtube content, a pipeline of prospective employees who encourage their employer to adopt it; raving at work about how good it is for their hobby projects and would solve all the problems their having, etc.<p>^that&#x27;s the genitive singular, lest you think it erroneously plural ;)\n\n        I think it is completely lost on this fresh companies that make commercial production software that the reason their &quot;competitors&quot; can charge $10k&#x2F;mo is because they are entrenched and established.<p>If you are new on the scene, give it to .edu for free and charge everyone else $100 for an annual license. If your product is legitimately good, in ten years you will be the entrenched and established one.\n\n      Thank you. Talking to EEs that do this every day I hear &quot;Well this would have to save me 1 day per month to be ROI positive&quot;.<p>Turns out saving that day is incredibly hard, because the professional workflows are intense.<p>Value of the product ends up being non-linear: either you&#x27;re valuable enough to be in an EE&#x27;s regular workflow saving time, or you&#x27;re not. Worth a whole lot once you are, worth next to nothing if you are not.\n\n      &gt; The average Kicad hobbiest wants this, but doesn’t need it.<p>Tbh, that&#x27;s true for lots of things.<p>Personally, I spend about 2% of a projects time on kicad related stuff, and the rest on software development for the board.<p>Anything complex enough to require real knowledge and experience I&#x27;d rather hire a board and circuit  designer.\n\n  &gt; A part of me sort of hates to see these companies do their thing, because it’s making the fun part of the job shorter and faster.<p>For sure! PCB layout is one of the best and most enjoyable parts of the job.<p>My major concern with these products is always the quality of the schematics they produce. It&#x27;s not enough for a schematic to have all the nets connected correctly - a schematic is a piece of documentation that, when drawn well, should convey a lot more information than simply what pin is connected to which others.\n\n    I&#x27;m not an EE, so please understand this as a sincere question: wouldn&#x27;t the code and its comments become documentation that would otherwise be in the well-drawn schematic?<p>As an outsider, my assumption is that the schematic would become less of a design document and more of a simple visualization.<p>What am I missing?\n\n      &gt;wouldn&#x27;t the code and its comments become documentation that would otherwise be in the well-drawn schematic?<p>Technically, yes, but 99% of EEs would not approve of code in some weird new DSL as documentation for a circuit.\nWhile it may contain the same information as a drawn schematic, it is much more inscrutable and introduces mental overhead when you actually need to read it.<p>There&#x27;s also a huge difference between a poorly laid out schematic and an excellent one; the latter makes it easier to follow the flow of signals and power through relevant parts of the circuit and allows you to easily pick out the different parts&#x2F;modules and how they play their part in the circuit as a whole, all with a quick glance at a drawing.<p>I guess a (poor) software analogy would be that you could surely implement a function as a bunch of GOTOs and&#x2F;or BRANCH commands, but just making a nested for loop would make the logic much clearer.\n\n        Yes absolutely this.<p>The major issue is that there are a lot more stake-holders in a schematic design than just the person who draws it.<p>Often the person who draws the schematic is not the person who lays out the PCB, so the schematic needs to encode information about how to lay the PCB out. For example, you may have several components in parallel in a filter circuit; the order that they are placed on the schematic can be used to communicate which order they should be placed on the board (but does not affect the electrical correctness of the schematic at all), and this in turn helps to betray the function of these components.<p>Even if the whole PCB design is being done by one engineer, other engineers need to be able to review it. If a schematic is electrically correct but otherwise a mess, it makes reviewing it a lot more difficult.<p>Then there will be third-parties who need to read the schematic and understand the design - for hobbyist products this could be the end-users, and in consumer products it might be service engineers. A well drawn schematic makes a PCB easier to understand and therefore easier to debug, repair, and modify.<p>In the analogy of software vs schematics, schematics are both code and documentation at the same time.\n\n      Schematics ended up being a hard requirement, so we put in the work to generate good ones automatically <i>and</i> the tools for EEs to adjust the aesthetics without ruining the correctness of the design.<p>You are right that the schematic becomes visualization&#x2F;documentation here - it&#x27;s not necessary to generate, because the only information it technically provides is a netlist which we already have from code.<p>But it&#x27;s needed documentation. In practice it&#x27;s helpful to use as you debug your design code.\n\n      There are some electronics products where schematics hardly convey anything. Heavily digital stuff is often just a whole bunch of squares with dense rows of lines connecting them. Maybe a few caps and resistors here and there.<p>For analog stuff though, a schematic is absolutely fundamental to understanding how the circuit works and how to troubleshoot&#x2F;fix it. Handing an engineer a code description of an analog circuit will basically have them just trying to mentally build the schematic in their head while reading it.<p>Imagine a model sharing 3D printing website that got rid of all the 3D model representations and just put the model code in their place. It would be borderline useless (despite your 3D printer having no issue still printing the stuff). Similar situation.\n\n(Apologies for my plebeian question to all EEs here.)<p>Is there software that would tell me what I need to buy to make this [Arduino QT Py] work with [this specific set of 200 IC LEDs]? Alternatively, how can I check if a specific combination of components would work together? I spent a few hours with Flux and EasyEDA, but didn&#x27;t get far.\n\n  I suggest a thorough discussion with GPT-4, based on datasheet information of the given parts, to talk through options for interfacing and then attempting to flesh them out and find concrete parts.\n\n  I&#x27;d rather ask at a specific forum, e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electronics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electronics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;</a>\n\n  You are in luck<p>Flux.ai does that…have a look at this tutorial <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y56AqPOjp0k&amp;t=366s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y56AqPOjp0k&amp;t=366s</a><p>Flux Copilot will happily assist you going from an idea to selecting the right components all the way to manufactured board!\n\n    Thanks! I replied to your colleague&#x27;s comment here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39783812\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39783812</a>\n\n  Hey! I can&#x27;t see your links to the LEDs or the QT Py, but I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re probably neopixels as you mentioned &quot;IC&quot; LEDs. Drag your parts into flux and just ask copilot how to connect them together properly. Just to speculate on your project, you probably want some sort of gate buffer for the neopixel signal. And just ensure whatever power source you are using (be it a 5V source or a battery or buck boost converter) can handle the total current draw of those LEDs. I believe they have a wide operating voltage, but also just double check that if you are using a constant voltage source (which you probably are), it isn&#x27;t over the maximum forward voltage of the LEDs. You can ask in detail with copilot by the way!<p>Just wanted to echo some more resources to get you oriented. The second video shows actual examples of how to leverage copilot in your exact scenario.  \nFlux End to End tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Nz-XvvlozK4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Nz-XvvlozK4</a>\nAI Architecture Exploration: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;iGJOzVf0o7o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;iGJOzVf0o7o</a>\n\n    Thanks for your reply, Mark!<p>The challenge for me is that the parts I&#x27;d like to use are not in the Flux library (or I can&#x27;t find them). If I understand correctly, I would need to add them manually. To make sure I can use your simulator to check if all parts would work together, I would have to write some code, which is, sadly, way above my skill level. (I am fine with writing code, I just don&#x27;t know enough about this domain.) I do like the Copilot feature, but, based on your video, it seems that I would need to add some properties that I don&#x27;t much about. Just to be clear, Flux looks great, but it is perhaps for more advanced folks than me.<p>Regarding my specific project, I would like to use:<p>1.

The idea was proven out!<p>Keep up the excellent work, seeing the autorouter come to fruition and demoed on the homepage is a massive accomplishment and mind blowing.\n\n  Thanks Mike! We&#x27;re still in VSCode -- thank you for kicking off that very first extension.\n\nGreat work! I really hope that you guys end up having a ton of industry interest. Really see JITX being a positive addition to the whole EDA toolchain. I remember several efforts from within the industry where even during copy&amp;paste from reference designs, the mistakes were made and the PCB batch was ending in a trash.<p>Once the library of snippets gets beefy, and people can build boards with their Raspberry Pis and Zeros on them, it&#x27;ll be a critical mass.<p>Good luck!\n\nIt&#x27;s interesting that OpenAI is listed, presumably as a customer. Wonder what chips they&#x27;re making? Probably not GPUs&#x2F;TPUs, but maybe a data collection unit or consumer board?\n\nThis looks amazing.\n\nAIUI JITX has potential to serve non-mainstream markets, including hobbyists, in ways that people aren&#x27;t really imagining at this point.<p>Unfortunately for them, though, the mainstream market, along with all of the incumbents, is where the $$ is that would fund non-mainstream support.  If the prime rate was still ~0% you might see a strategy out of JITX wherein they&#x27;d first take some spectacular swings for the fences in smaller markets.  Those kind of successes would make quite the splash here.<p>But now they&#x27;ve got to go fight it out for the enterprise seats, and, for a half-dozen reasons, post-haste.  If they can manage that successfully, I expect they&#x27;ll soon also be able to do great things for hobbyists, on hobbyist budgets.\n\n  Hobbiest friendly with a $1k per month license the second you want to sell something?<p>Ok, disagree though.\n\n  Hey - you got this very correct. Good insights as to what we&#x27;re up to. Grueling to build product for the pros, but once done it can support a lot of people.<p>Good automation can dissolve false dichotomies.\n\nI nearly passed out when I saw the intensely squiggly traces\n\nI&#x27;ve been out of this industry for a while now so my thoughts may be a bit dated but it seems to me that the current trend is components suppliers and board manufactures are offering design solutions has it value added resource to there customers. E.g. Element 14 or seeds studio. And down\n\n  Sorry for the typos, I&#x27;m a quadriplegic using Voice dictation on an Apple iPad and sometimes it gets words wrong [especially homonyms]\n\n  Seems right - Renesas just acquired Altium after all. Varies a lot by customer.\n\nGood idea and concept. I fully support the idea.<p>Being able to specify a generic part requirement instead of hunting for a specific part is nice sometimes, but any company that makes more than a couple boards already has this covered with a bom management system.<p>Adding parts via text is nice and fast, but also glosses over many aspects of the part. Say I use a Diodes Inc buck regulator. It has a valid input voltage range it will accept. It has multiple ways it can be wired depending on the application. Wire for buck, septic, etc. PFM on&#x2F;auto&#x2F;off, etc. I don&#x27;t see control over details like that.<p>Your About Us page is longer and more extensive than your actual product example page.<p>I see 4-5 very basic designs that I could bang out in Altium in under a day each. Are you selling to people unable to make PCBs? I look for ways to save time because I wear many hats in my job, only 1 of which is doing a board. However, I would not be able to save any time using this tool, because it would produce an inferior result. Additionally, after only 8 months of paying for this product, someone can already afford a full Altium license.<p>I want to save time on stuff like breaking out and pin swapping IO on a large FPGA. Handle DDR3 routing for me. These are things that actually take time, because you need to understand the device and read through tons of PDFs. However, I think that might also be the most difficult part to add to your product.<p>Finally, how does it handle physical constraints like non- square board outlines, mounting hole placement, and 3d STEP integration?\n\n  Good set of questions, and thanks for the feedback. Currently updating the website to add this stuff.<p>Comments&#x2F;answers to questions in order:<p>1. Yes, finding a single resistor is easy. Part solving is more about making parametric circuits possible. (like a buck regulator that can configure itself on SS, output voltage). There you need to calculate values from parameters and then go find a part you can actually buy. Doing that manually is less magical of an experience.<p>2. Yes - some example code here (have not documented yet, apologies) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JITx-Inc&#x2F;jitx-cookbook&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;regulator_example&#x2F;main.stanza\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JITx-Inc&#x2F;jitx-cookbook&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;regulato...</a><p>3. Our customers are professional EEs doing really complex work (e.g. many 30Ghz SERDES), and our website is drastically out of date. Will update design on site soon - this post was some guy submitting our landing page to HN. I&#x27;m trying to keep up!<p>4. Yes, this works already. Was very hard to do on the product side, design code was relatively simple. DDR3 example here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;bw4KxhV-d8g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;bw4KxhV-d8g</a><p>5. Physical constraints are imported or generated - works quite well to automatically sync electromechanicals. Mutliple 3D models including STEP can be added to parts, again I need to update the website.\n\nI&#x27;m curious here...I&#x27;ve only ever gotten deep enough into pcb design to modify an open source motor controller. What does this give you that I couldn&#x27;t get out of KiCad? From what I can tell, there are autorouters and autolayout and design rule checks. Is it just better execution?\n\nI just noticed if you click &quot;start trial&quot; it will automatically add 1 $1000 license to cart. Really? Doing classic hidden subscription dark patterns for a $1000&#x2F;month software. It&#x27;s already shitty thing to do for a $15 streaming services, but for something like this I would expect a more professional attitude.\n\nYour signup and contact forms are broken and tell me 405 not allowed."

This leads many people to believe that btrfs is an Oracle project—it is not.

That implies a high level of control&#x2F;involvement in the project.\n\n                It shows belonging, at the very least. The quote from Jim Salter was &quot;The project belonged to Mason, <i>not to his employer</i>&quot; (emphasis added). The copyright line demonstrably and incontestably refutes this claim. btrfs belongs to Oracle.\n\n      I don&#x27;t think that would work; all of the changes since the fork are also CDDL and they aren&#x27;t owned by any one entity&#x2F;person.

If Oracle decides to attempt to exert control over ZFS and interfere with the use or distribution of ZFS with Linux, they have ample resources to make a lot of very expensive trouble for various users and organizations. Oracle&#x27;s history—most importantly, their history vs Google re Java in Android—means it would not be much of a stretch for them to decide to start behaving like The SCO Group. I do not think this risk is large. But I do think it is a real risk that a cautious Linux distro can reasonably be worried about.<p>If you truly believe that Oracle&#x27;s lack of action thus far against ZFS on Linux and their public statements of their beliefs about the effects of the CDDL and GPL would prevent them from <i>starting shit</i>, then you are simply wrong about how our legal system works, and there are plenty of examples. The things you point to to bolster your arguments about what the law says are things that would make it hard for Oracle to win a lawsuit on its merits, but the eventual judgement is hardly the only thing that matters when assessing a legal risk—<i>especially</i> if your pockets are not as deep as Oracle&#x27;s.\n\n                  &gt; I do not think this risk is large. But I do think it is a real risk that a cautious Linux distro can reasonably be worried about.<p>The 2nd or 3rd most commercially important Linux distro has been using ZFS since 2016.<p>&gt; If you truly believe that Oracle&#x27;s lack of action thus far against ZFS on Linux and their public statements of their beliefs about the effects of the CDDL and GPL would prevent them from starting shit<p>I understand the argument &quot;Oracle might do something&quot;, plus spooky magic fingers and creepy noises, all too well.  Except it&#x27;s not actually an argument.  It might be best described as a boogeyman, sent to frighten little children into not running ZFS.<p>My point was:  I think it&#x27;s time for you to get over sleeping with the light on.<p>In 2000, we called this FUD when Microsoft did this.  In 2024, we should know better, even when you&#x27;re fronting for the FSF or the SFC.\n\n      In addition to what mustache_kimono said, there apparently seem to be issues with kernel functions moving  &#x2F; changing and breaking ZFS which then needs a while to catch up. For the latest reoccurrence of this, see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;15931\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;15931</a> for Linux 6.8 compatibility.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that not everything is OOB compatible with ZFS. For example, newer versions of systemd have been able to use the TPM to unlock drives encrypted with LUKS. AFAIK it doesn&#x27;t work with ZFS.<p>I use ZFS on my daily driver Linux box and mostly love it, but as long as these things happen, I can see why people may want to try to find an in-kernel solution. I personally use Arch so expect for bleeding edge updates to not work perfectly right away. But I recall seeing folks complaining about issues on Fedora, too, which I expect to be a bit more conservative than Arch.\n\n        LUKS and the associated systemd hook shouldn&#x27;t care about the filesystem, right? It&#x27;s just block layer<p>But presumably you meant native ZFS encryption, which unfortunately is considered to be somewhat experimental and neglected, as I understand. Which surprised me, since I thought data at rest encryption would be pretty important for an &quot;enterprise&quot; filesystem<p>Still, apparently lots of people successfully run ZFS on LUKS. It does mean you don&#x27;t get zero-trust zfs send backups, but apparently that&#x27;s where a lot of the bugs have been anyway\n\n          Yes, I was talking about ZFS native encryption.<p>&gt; But presumably you meant native ZFS encryption, which unfortunately is considered to be somewhat experimental and neglected, as I understand. Which surprised me, since I thought data at rest encryption would be pretty important for an &quot;enterprise&quot; filesystem.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;ve happened about someone saying something similar, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything about that from &quot;official&quot; sources. Wouldn&#x27;t mind a link or something if you have one on hand. But there is the fact that this encryption scheme seems limited when compared to LUKS: there&#x27;s no support for multiple passphrases or using anything more convenient, like say, a U2F token.<p>&gt; Still, apparently lots of people successfully run ZFS on LUKS. It does mean you don&#x27;t get zero-trust zfs send backups, but apparently that&#x27;s where a lot of the bugs have been anyway<p>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m one of those people, never had any issue with this in ~ten years of use. And, indeed, the main reason for using this on my laptop is being able to send the snapshots around without having to deal with another tool for managing encryption. Also, on my servers on which I run RAIDZ, having to configure LUKS on top of each drive is a PITA.\n\n    Why would Btrfs have a big(ger) future than Bcachefs when the latter seems to have the same functionality and less &#x27;historical baggage&#x27;†?<p>I remember when Btrfs was initially released (I was doing Solaris sysadmining, and it was billed as &quot;ZFS for Linux&quot;), and yet here we are all these years later and it still seems to be &#x27;meh&#x27;.<p>† E.g., RAID5+ that&#x27;s less likely to eat data:<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btrfs.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;btrfs-man5.html#raid56-status-and-recommended-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btrfs.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;btrfs-man5.html#raid5...</a><p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcachefs.org&#x2F;ErasureCoding&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcachefs.org&#x2F;ErasureCoding&#x2F;</a>  &#x2F; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koverstreet&#x2F;bcachefs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;657\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koverstreet&#x2F;bcachefs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;657</a>\n\n      By the time future-bcachefs has feature parity with present-btrfs, who knows what more will be in future-btrfs?<p>For your specific example, bcachefs&#x27;s erasure coding is very experimental and currently pretty much unusable, while btrfs is actively working towards fixing the raid56 write hole with the recent addition of the raid-stripe-tree. By the time bcachefs has a trustworthy parity profile, btrfs&#x27;s <i>may</i> be just as good.\n\n        Bcachefs has not advertised erasure coding as production ready only to renege on that claim later. So nobody has been unwittingly burned yet.\n\n        &gt; <i>For your specific example</i><p>My specific example says that the bcachefs are &quot;actively working towards fixing the raid56 write hole&quot; as well—or rather, their way of doing things doesn&#x27;t have one in the first place.\n\n          &gt; bcachefs are &quot;actively working towards fixing the raid56 write hole&quot; as well<p>Yep, that&#x27;s my point. Neither btrfs nor bcachefs have a write-hole-less parity raid profile implementation yet, and both are working towards one. We don&#x27;t know if one will be finished and battle tested significantly before the other, or if one will prove to be more performant or reliable. Just have to wait and see.\n\n  When can we expect debian to ship Bcachefs?\n\n    Bcachefs is in the Linux 6.7 kernel, and that is available in Debian <i>unstable</i> and <i>experimental</i>:<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packages.debian.org&#x2F;search?keywords=linux-image-6.7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packages.debian.org&#x2F;search?keywords=linux-image-6.7</a><p>* Search &quot;6.7.1-1~exp1&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metadata.ftp-master.debian.org&#x2F;changelogs&#x2F;&#x2F;main&#x2F;l&#x2F;linux&#x2F;linux_6.7.4-1~exp1_changelog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metadata.ftp-master.debian.org&#x2F;changelogs&#x2F;&#x2F;main&#x2F;l&#x2F;li...</a>\n\n    Bcachefs is not a drop-in replacement for btrfs yet.  It&#x27;s still missing critical things like scrub:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcachefs.org&#x2F;Roadmap&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcachefs.org&#x2F;Roadmap&#x2F;</a>\n\n  As a heavy btrfs user, I do expect bcachefs to fully replace it eventually. But that&#x27;s still many years off.\n\n  I fully expect bcachefs will initially hit similar issues like btrfs.<p>Until now (bcachefs has been merged) it has only been used by people running custom kernels. As more people try it, it will hit more and more drives with buggy firmware and whatnot.\n\n    They&#x27;re in a slightly different position though. Bcache itself has existed for many years and has been used in production. Bcachefs changes it quite a bit, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any basic issues we&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.\n\nJust last week my btrfs filesystem got irrecoverably corrupted. This is like the fourth time it has happened to me in the last 10 years. Do not use it in consumer grade hardware. Compared to this, ext4 is rock solid. It was even able to survive me accidentally passing the currently running host&#x27;s hard disk to a VM guest, which booted from it.\n\n  &gt;  last week my btrfs filesystem got irrecoverably corrupted.<p>This is 2 bugs really.    1, the file system got corrupted.   2, tooling didn&#x27;t exist to automatically scan through the disk data structures and recover as much of your drive as possible from whatever fragments of metadata and data were left.<p>For 2, it should happen by default.    Most users don&#x27;t want a &#x27;disk is corrupt, refusing to mount&#x27; error.   Most users want any errors to auto-correct if possible and get on with their day.  Keep a recovery logfile with all the info needed to reverse any repairs for that small percentage of users who want to use a hex editor to dive into data corruption by hand.\n\n    Where is that log file supposed to be stored? It can&#x27;t be on the same filesystem it was created for or it negates the purpose of its creation.\n\n      If I were designing it, the recovery process would:<p>* scan through the whole disk and, for every sector, decide if it is &quot;definitely free space (part of the free space table, not referenced by any metadata)&quot;, &quot;definitely metadata&#x2F;file data&quot;, &quot;unknown&#x2F;unsure (ie. perhaps referenced by some dangling metadata&#x2F;an old version of some tree nodes)&quot;.<p>* I would then make a new file containing a complete image of the whole filesystem pre-repair, but leaving out the &#x27;definitely free space&#x27; parts.<p>* such a file takes nearly zero space, considering btrfs&#x27;s copy-on-write and sparse-file abilities.<p>* I would then repair the filesystem to make everything consistent.   The pre-repair file would still be available for any tooling wanting to see what the filesystem looked like before it was repaired.  You could even loopmount it or try other repair options on it.<p>* I would probably encourage distros to auto-delete this recovery file if disk space is low&#x2F;after some time, since otherwise the recovery image will end up pinning user data to using up disk space for years and users will be unhappy.<p>The above fails in only one case:   Free space on the drive is very low.   In that case, I would probably just do the repairs in-RAM and mount the filesystem readonly, and have a link to a wiki page on possible manual repair routes.\n\n        &gt;The above fails in only one case: Free space on the drive is very low.<p>No.\nMost of the block will be marked as unsure in first step -- because most of them had been used before thanks to CoW\n\n          A heuristic could be written like &#x27;protect the latest version of each node, plus 2 prior versions, but anything older you find, treat it as free apace&#x27;.\n\n    Yeah the last time I had a btrfs volume die, there were a few troubleshooting&#x2F;recovery steps on the wiki which I dutifully followed. Complete failure, no data recoverable. The last step was &quot;I dunno, go ask someone on IRC.&quot; Great.<p>It&#x27;s understandable that corruption can happen due to bugs or hardware failure or user insanity, but my experience was that the recovery tools are useless, and that&#x27;s a big problem.\n\n    Writing to a corrupted filesystem by default is bad design. The corruption could be caused by a hardware problem that is exacerbated by further writes, leading to additional data loss.\n\n  &gt; It was even able to survive me accidentally passing the currently running host&#x27;s hard disk to a VM guest, which booted from it.<p>I have also done this, and was also happy that the only corruption was to a handful of unimportant log files.    Part of a robust filesystem is that when the user does something stupid, the blast radius is small.<p>Other less-smart filesystems could easily have said &quot;root of btree version mismatch, deleting bad btree node, deleting a bunch of now unused btree nodes, your filesystem is now empty, have a nice day&quot;.\n\n  Best send a bugreport to the btrfs mailing list at linux-btrfs@vger.kernel.org.<p>If possible include the last kernel log entries before it corrupted. Include kernel version, drive model and drive firmware version.\n\n  how do you know it was issue with FS and not actual hardware&#x2F;disk?..\n\n    Yeah, that&#x27;s the fun part of the ext&#x2F;btrfs corruption posts. If you got repeating corruption on btrfs on the same drive but not on ext, how do you know it&#x27;s not just a drive failure that ext is not able to notice? What would happen if you tried ext with dm-integrity?\n\n  I have had same btrfs filesystem in use for 15+ years, with 6 disks of various sizes. And all hardware components changed at least once during the fileystsen lifetime.<p>Worst corruption was when one DIMM started corrupting data. As a result computer kept crashing and eventually refused to mount because of btrfs checksum mismatches.<p>Fix was to buy new HW. Then run btrfs filesystem repairs, which failed at some point but at least got the filesystem running as long as I did not touch the most corrupted locations, luckily it was RAID1 so most checksums had a correct value on another disk.\nUnfortunately the checksum tree had on two locations corruption on both copies.\nI had to open the raw disks with hex editor and change the offending byte to correct value, after which the filesystem has been running again smoothly for 5 years.<p>And to find the location to modify on the disks I built a custom kernel that printed the expected value and absolute disk position when it detected the specific corruption. Plus had to ask a friend to double check my changes since I did not have any backups.\n\n    &gt; running again smoothly for 5 years<p>So did you bite the bullet and get ECC, or are you just waiting for the next corruption caused by memory errors? :)\n\n  &gt; Compared to this, ext4 is rock solid.<p>Ext4 is the most reliable file system I have ever used. Just works and has never failed on me, not even once. No idea why btrfs can&#x27;t match its quality despite over a decade of development.\n\n  Huh. I&#x27;ve been running btrfs on a number of systems for probably 12 years at this point. One array in particular was 12TiB of raw storage used for storing VM images in heavy use. Each disk had ~9 years of spindle-on time before I happened to look closely at the SMART output and realized that they were all ST3000DM001&#x27;s and promptly swapped them all out. The only issue I&#x27;ve ever run into is running out of metadata chunks and needing to rebalance, and that was just once.\n\n  Bad DIMM is a thing, even more so on consumer HW that lack ECC. I recommend you run memtest\n\nI recently tried (for the first time) Btrfs on my low-end laptop (no snapshots), and I was surprised to see that the laptop ran even worse than it usually does! Turns out there was something like a &quot;btrfs-cleaner&quot; (or similar) running in the background, eating up almost all the CPU at all time. After about 2 days I jumped over to ext4 and everything ran just fine.\n\n  Interesting that the &#x27;cleaner&#x27; doesn&#x27;t run as nice?\n\n    I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a kernel thread, not a process, since it&#x27;s part of the filesystem. So it can&#x27;t be renice&#x27;d.\n\n      Oh, that&#x27;s annoying.  I wonder if there&#x27;s a way with kernel configs etc to only run that thread when there&#x27;s nothing better to do?  Sounds like something someone would have thought of in general for background house keeping?\n\n  &gt; I recently tried Btrfs on my low-end laptop (no snapshots)<p>Do snapshots degrade the performance of btrfs?\n\n    No noticeably.\nyou see the difference when enabling CoW though\n\n  What was your workload? Do you have quotas enabled? Compression? Are you running OpenSuse by any chance?\n\n    Workload was literally zero, I just logged into XFCE and could barely do anything for 2 days straight. No quotas and no compression, but it was indeed openSUSE!\n\n      That explains it, because openSUSE uses snapshots and quotas by default. It creates a snapshot before and one after every package manager interaction and cleans up old snapshots once per day.<p>Unfortunately, deleting snapshots with quotas is an expensive operation that needs to rescan some structures to keep the quota information consistent and that is what you&#x27;re seeing.\n\n        I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s correct. When you install openSUSE (this was a clean install) there&#x27;s a checkbox that asks if you want snapshots, which I did not enable. But either way, a fresh openSUSE install with XFCE on Btrfs rendering the  computer unusable for, at least, 2 days is not okay in my book, even if snapshots were enabled.\n\n  Had a similar problem but can&#x27;t remember the Btrfs process. Anyway, after I switched off Btrfs quotas, everything was fine.\n\nOne btrfs bug which is 100% reproducible:<p>* Start with an ext3 filesystem 70% full.<p>* Convert to btrfs using btrfs-convert.<p>* Delete the ext3_saved snapshot of the original filesystem as recommended by the convert utility.<p>* Enable compression (-o compress) and defrag the filesystem as recommended by the man page for how to compress all existing data.<p>It fails with out of disk space, leaving a filesystem which isn&#x27;t repairable - deleting files will not free any space.<p>The fact such a bug seems to have existed for years, with such a basic following of the man pages for a common use case (migration to btrfs to make use of its compression abilities to get more free space), tells me that it isn&#x27;t yet ready for primetime.\n\n  &gt; deleting files will not free any space.<p>Does a rebalance fix it? I have once (and only once, back when it was new) hit a &quot;out of disk space&quot; situation with btrfs, and IIRC rebalancing was enough to fix it.<p>&gt; for a common use case<p>It might have been a common use case back when btrfs was new (though I doubt it, most users of btrfs probably created the filesystem from scratch even back then), but I doubt it&#x27;s a common use case nowadays.\n\n    &gt; It might have been a common use case back when btrfs was new (though I doubt it, most users of btrfs probably created the filesystem from scratch even back then), but I doubt it&#x27;s a common use case nowadays.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps not as common as it once was, but you&#x27;d expect it to be common enough to work, and not some obscure corner case.\n\n    From my perspective, A filesystem is a <i>critical infrastructure</i> in an OS, and failing here and there and not fixing these bugs because they&#x27;re not common is not acceptable.<p>Same for the RAID5&#x2F;6 bugs in BTRFS. What&#x27;s their solution? A simple warning in the docs:<p>&gt; RAID5&#x2F;6 has known problems and should not be used in production. [0]<p>Also the CLI <i>discourages you</i> from creating these things. Brilliant.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t use BTRFS anywhere. An FS shall be bulletproof. Errors must only cause from hardware problems. Not random bugs in a filesystem.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btrfs.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;mkfs.btrfs.html#multiple-devices\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btrfs.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;mkfs.btrfs.html#multi...</a>\n\n      Machines die. Hardware has bugs, or is broken. Things just bork. It&#x27;s a fact of life.<p>Would I build a file storage system around btrfs? No - without proper redundancy at least. But I&#x27;m told at least Synology does.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s plenty of cases where it&#x27;s perfectly usable - the feature set it has today is plenty useful and the worst case scenario is an host reimage.<p>I can live with that. applications will generally break production ten billion times before btrfs does.\n\n        &gt; Machines dies. Hardware has bugs, or is broken. Things just bork. It&#x27;s a fact of life.<p>I know, I&#x27;m a sysadmin. I care for hardware, mend it, heal it, and sometimes donate, cann-bird or bury it. I&#x27;m used to it.<p>&gt; worst case scenario is an host reimage...<p>While hosting PBs of data on it? No, thanks.<p>&gt; Would I build a file storage system around btrfs? No - without proper redundancy at least.<p>Everything is <i>easy</i> for small n. When you store 20TB on 4x5TB drives, everything can be done. When you have a &gt;5PB of storage on racks, you need at least a copy of that system running hot-standby. That&#x27;s not cheap in any sense.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d use ZFS, Lustre, anything, but not BTRFS.<p>&gt; I can live with that - applications will generally break production ten billion times before btrfs does.<p>In our case, no. Our systems doesn&#x27;t stop because a daemon decided to stop because a server among many fried itself.\n\n          I have worked on and around systems with an order of magnitude more data and a single node failing did not matter. We weren&#x27;t using btrfs anyway (for data drives) and it definitely was not cheap. But storage never is.<p>But again, most systems are not like that. Kubernetes cluster nodes? Reimage at will. Compute nodes for vms backed by SAN? Reimage at will. Btrfs can actually make that reimage faster and it&#x27;s pretty reliable on a single flash drive so why not?\n\n            Well, that was my primary point. BTRFS is not ready for these kind of big installations handled by ZFS or Lustre at this point.<p>On the other hand, BTRFS’ single disk performance, esp, for small files is visibly lower than EXT4 and XFS, so why bother?<p>There are many solutions for EXT4 which allows versioning, and if I can reimage a node (or 200) in 5 minute flat, why should I bother with the overhead of BTRFS?<p>It’s not that I haven’t tried BTRFS. Its features are nice, but from my perspective, it’s not ready for prime time, yet. What bothers me is the mental gymnastics pretending that it’s mature at this point.<p>It’ll be good file system. An excellent one in fact, but it still needs to cook.\n\n        My impression of btrfs is that it&#x27;s very useful and stable if you stay away from the sharp edges. Until you run into some random scenario that leads you to an unrecoverable file system.<p>But it has been that way for now 14 years. Sure, there are far fewer sharp edges now than there were back then. For a host you can just reimage it&#x27;s fine, for a well-tested fairly restricted system it&#x27;s fine. I stay far away from it for personal computers and my home-built NAS, because just about any other fs seems to be more stable.\n\n          The thing is, none of the systems I have the luxury to run a filesystem which can randomly explode any time because I pressed a button developers didn&#x27;t account for, yet.<p>I have bitten by ReiserFS&#x27; superblock corruption once, and that time I had plenty of time to rebuild my system leisurely. My current life doesn&#x27;t allow for that. I need to be able to <i>depend</i> on my systems.<p>Again, I believe BTRFS will be an excellent filesystem in the long run. It&#x27;s not ready yet for &quot;format, mount and forget&quot; from my perspective. Only I&#x27;m against is, &quot;it runs on my machine, so yours&#x27; is a skill issue&quot; take, which is harmful on many levels.\n\n        Synology uses btrfs on top of classic mdadm RAID; AFAIK they don&#x27;t use btrfs&#x27;s built-in RAID, or even any of btrfs&#x27;s more advanced features.\n\n      You do you.<p>Personally, btrfs just works and the features are worth it.<p>Btrfs raid always gets brought up in these discussions, but you can just not use it. The reality is that it didn&#x27;t have a commercial backer until now with Western Digital.\n\n        If it works <i>for you</i>, then it&#x27;s great. However, this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it <i>does not work</i> for many others.<p>If I&#x27;m <i>just not</i> gonna use BTRFS&#x27; RAID, I can <i>just use</i> mdadm + any file system I want. In this case, any file system becomes &quot;anything but btrfs&quot; from my point of view.<p>I&#x27;ve burnt by ReiserFS once. I&#x27;m not taking the same gamble with another FS, thanks.\n\n    There’s literally no way I could migrate my NAS other than through an in-place FS conversion since it’s &gt;&gt;50% full.<p>The same probably applies to may consumer devices.\n\n    A rebalance means that every file on the filesystem will be rewritten.<p>This is drastic, and I&#x27;d rather perform such an operation on an image copy.<p>This is one case where ZFS is absolutely superior; if a drive goes offline, and is returned to a set at a later date, the resilver only touches the changed&#x2F;needed blocks. Btrfs forces the entire filesystem to be rewritten in a rebalance, which is much more drastic.<p>I am very willing to allow ZFS mirrors to be degraded; I would never, ever let this happen to btrfs if at all avoidable.\n\n      The desired &quot;compress every file&quot; operation will also cause every file on the filesystem to be rewritten though ...\n\n  As a Linux user since kernel 0.96, I have never once considered doing an in-place migration to a new file system. That seems like a crazy thing to try to do, and I would hope it’s only done as a last resort and with all data fully backed up before trying it.<p>I would agree that if this is presented in the documentation as something it supports, then it should work as expected. If it doesn’t work, then a pull request to remove it from the docs might be the best course of action.\n\n    I don&#x27;t know if you talk only about linux or you meant your comment as a generalization, but have you heard of in place APFS migration from HFS+ ?\n\n      Similarly Microsoft offered FAT32 to NTFS in-place migration, and it did the required checks <i>before starting</i> to ensure it completes successfully. It was more than 20 years ago IIRC.\n\n        The notable thing with APFS is that the migration came automatically with an OS update (to high sierra) by default.\n\n          Yes, I think also mounting ext3 systems as ext4 and migrating it to ext4 as you access it is a good way too. IIRC you had to enable a couple of flags in the ext3 system with tune2fs to enable ext4 features as well, but it didn&#x27;t break, and migrated as you write &amp; delete files.\n\n    The design of the convert utility is pretty good - the convert is effectively atomic - at any point during conversion, if you kill power midway, the disk is either a valid ext4 filesystem, or a valid btrfs filesystem.\n\n      It is atomic, but at least for me it left both types of checks that BTRFS can do with unrecoverable errors for a few blocks.<p>All in all not too terrible and I just accepted the bogus data as good by resetting (?) the checksums for those blocks. But acting as if it’s just a terminal command and Bob’s your uncle.. that’s just wrong.\n\n    &gt;That seems like a crazy thing to try to do<p>It seems like a reasonable thing to want to do. Would you never update an installed application or the kernel to get new features or fixes? I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s much fundamental difference. If what you mean is &quot;it seems likely to fail catastrophically&quot;, well that seems like an indication that either the converter or the target filesystem isn&#x27;t in a good state.\n\n      &gt; It seems like a reasonable thing to want to do<p>This was actually a routine thing to do, under iOS and macOS, with the transition from HFS to APFS.\n\n        Don&#x27;t forget about FAT32 to NTFS long before that.\n\n          both transitions were mandated by a supporting organization thou.\n\n      &gt; Would you never update an installed application or the kernel to get new features or fixes?<p>Honestly, if that was an <i>option</i> without the certainty of getting pwned due to some RCE down the road, then yes, there are cases where I absolutely wouldn&#x27;t want to update some software and just have it chugging away for years in its present functional state.\n\n        And there are no cases where you actually want a new feature?\n\n          &gt; And there are no cases where you actually want a new feature?<p>Sure there are, sometimes! But at the same time, in other situations stability and predictability would take precedence over anything else, e.g. any new features that might get released probably wouldn&#x27;t matter too much for a given use case.<p>For example, I could take a new install of MariaDB that has come out recently and use it for the same project for 5 years with no issues, because the current feature set would be enough for the majority of use cases. Of course, that&#x27;s not entirely realistic, because of the aforementioned security situation.<p>Applies the same to OS and&#x2F;or kernel versions, like how you could take a particular version of RHEL or Ubuntu LTS and use it for the lifespan of some project, although in that case you do at least get security updates and such.\n\n      There&#x27;s a world of difference between a version update and completely switching software. Enabling new features on an existing ext4 file system is something I would expect to be perfectly safe. In-place converting an ext4 file system into btrfs... in an ideal world that would work, of course, but it sounds vastly more tricky even in the best case.\n\n      Live migration of a file system is like replacing the foundation of your house while still living in it. It’s not the same thing as updating apps which would be more like redecorating a room. Sure it’s possible, but it’s very risky and a lot more work than simply doing a full backup and restore.\n\n        What&#x27;s a full backup and restore in your analogy? Building a new house? Moving the house to a safe place, replace the foundation, bring the house back?\n\n          &gt; Moving the house to a safe place, replace the foundation, bring the house back?<p>this seems sensible\n\n  It&#x27;s open source: if things don&#x27;t get fixed, it&#x27;s because no user cares enough to fix it. I&#x27;m certainty not wasting my time on that, nobody uses ext3 anymore!<p>You are as empowered to fix this as anybody else, if it presents a real problem for you.\n\n    You can reliably change ext3 with ext4 in the GP&#x27;s comment. It&#x27;s not an extX problem, it&#x27;s an BTRFS problem.<p>If nobody cares that much, maybe deprecate the tool, then?<p>Also, just because it&#x27;s Open Source (TM) doesn&#x27;t mean developers will accept any patch regardless of its quality. Like everything, FOSS is 85% people, 15% code.<p>&gt; You are as empowered to fix this as anybody else, if it presents a real problem for you.<p>I have reported many bugs in Open Source software. If I had the time to study code and author a fix, I&#x27;d submit the patch itself, which I was able to do, a couple of times.\n\n      &gt; If nobody cares that much, maybe deprecate the tool, then?<p>If you think that&#x27;s the right thing to do, you&#x27;re as free as anybody else to send documentation patches. I doubt anybody would argue with you here, but who knows :)<p>&gt; Also, just because it&#x27;s Open Source (TM) doesn&#x27;t mean developers will accept any patch regardless of its quality.<p>Of course not. If you want to make a difference, you have to put in the work. It&#x27;s worth it IMHO.\n\n        &gt; If you think that&#x27;s the right thing to do, you&#x27;re as free as anybody else to send documentation patches :)<p>That won&#x27;t do anything. Instead I can start a small commotion by sending a small request (to the mailing lists) to deprecate the tool, which I don&#x27;t want to do. Because I&#x27;m busy. :)<p>Also, I don&#x27;t like commotions, and prefer civilized discussions.<p>&gt; Of course not. If you want to make a difference, you have to put in the work. It&#x27;s worth it IMHO.<p>Of course. This is what I do. For example, I have a one liner in Debian Installer. I had a big patch in GDM, but after coordinating with the developers, they decided to not merge the fix + new feature, for example.\n\n          &gt; For example, I have a one liner in Debian Installer. I had a big patch in GDM, but after coordinating with the developers, they decided to not merge the fix + new feature, for example<p>Surely you were given some justification as to why they didn&#x27;t want to merge it? I realize sometimes these things are intractable, but in my experience that&#x27;s rare... usually things can iterate towards a mutually agreeable solution.\n\n            The sad part is they didn’t.<p>GTK has (or had) a sliding infoline widget, which is used to show notifications. GDM used it for password related prompts. It actually relayed PAM messages to that widget.<p>We were doing mass installations backed by an LDAP server which had password policies, including expiration enabled.<p>That widget had a bug, prevented it displaying a new message when it was in the middle of an animation, which effectively ate messages related to LDAP (Your password will expire in X days, etc.).<p>Also we needed a keyboard selector in that window, which was absent.<p>I gave heads up to the GDM team, they sent a “go ahead” as a reply. I have written an elaborate patch, which they rejected and wanted a simpler one. I iterated the way they wanted, they said it passes the muster and will be merged.<p>Further couple of mails never answered. I’m basically ghosted.<p>But the merge never came, and I moved on.\n\n              This sort of thing happens <i>all the time</i> in big orgs which develop a single product internally with a closed source… there isn’t any fix for this part of human nature, apparently.\n\n      for me it&#x27;s a problem of the tool converting in place EXT to BTRFS. Not necessarily a problem of BTRFS.\n\n        I tried to say it’s a problem of BTRFS the project. Not BTRFS the file system.\n\n    &gt; You are as empowered to fix this as anybody else, if it presents a real problem for you.<p>I’m getting sick and tired of this argument. It’s very user unfriendly<p>Do you work in software? If yes, do you own a component? Have you tried using this argument with your colleagues that have no idea about your component?<p>Of course they theoretically are empowered to fix the bug, but that doesn’t make it easier. They may have no idea about how filesystem internal. Or they may be just users and have no programming background at all\n\n      It&#x27;s not unfriendly, it&#x27;s just how it is. The fact you&#x27;re comparing it to industry shows you don&#x27;t get it.<p>Open source doesn&#x27;t work for you. You can&#x27;t demand that it do things you want: you have to push and justify them yourself, and hopefully you find other people along the way who want the same things and can help you.<p>I taught myself to program as a teenager trying to fix bugs in Linux. If I could do it, anybody can. That&#x27;s what makes it empowering.\n\n        Well I think you&#x27;re completely right, in a way. But I also don&#x27;t see the problem with people telling other people to not use the software or to complain about it. They are totally in their right to complain about stuff. Now obviously if the complaining involves requiring people to work for some feature you want, that&#x27;s entitled and wack. Same goes for throwing a fit because maintainers went for systemd instead of your own favorite init system.<p>But  being open source doesn&#x27;t mean people shouldn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t just say &quot;this is bad&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t use x&quot; or even &quot;this X feature doesn&#x27;t work when using Y&quot; (now If what they are saying isn&#x27;t true, sure we should call them out)<p>It&#x27;s normal and in fact I think it should be encouraged, as not everyone can be aware of potential problems they could have with a piece of OSS that is already known in some obscure dev mailing list. The more people are informed and aware of potential issues, the less they will be surprised and complain about it when they start using it.<p>(Fwiw I love btrfs, and I think it&#x27;s very reliable)\n\n        Read the thread again. No one asked anyone to work for free.<p>Please don’t put words in other peoples mouth.\n\n    I think the parent comment&#x27;s fix is to not use btrfs and warn others about how risky they estimate it is.\n\nFor what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m happy with using Btrfs on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and the provided tooling like snapper and restoring Btrfs snapshots from grub, saved me a few times.<p>SSD used: Samsung SSD 970 PRO 1T, same installation since 2020-05-02.\n\nI&#x27;m so sad. I was in the btrfs corner for over a decade, and it saddens me to say that ZFS has won. But it has.<p>And ZFS is actually good. I&#x27;m happy with it. I don&#x27;t think about it. I&#x27;ve moved on.<p>Sorry, btrfs, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to work out between us. Maybe in a different life.\n\n  I’m personally cheering for Bcachefs now.\n\n  What saddens me is the fact they <i>still</i> haven&#x27;t managed to put ZFS into the Linux kernel tree because of licensing nonsense.\n\n    It&#x27;s not Linux&#x27;s fault for not merging ZFS. Blame Oracle.\n\n      I know. I was blaming Oracle, and Sun before them. Why can&#x27;t they just relicense the entire thing as GPL or some other license that&#x27;s actually open source and GPL-compatible such as MIT? They own the copyright, don&#x27;t they? Surely they have the power to do that.<p>ZFS is too important to not be in Linux. Yet it&#x27;s 2024 and it&#x27;s still not in there. Because of licensing copyright nonsense. The blame falls solely on the copyright owners.\n\n  &gt; I&#x27;m so sad. I was in the btrfs corner for over a decade, and it saddens me to say that ZFS has won. But it has.<p>&gt; And ZFS is actually good. I&#x27;m happy with it. I don&#x27;t think about it. I&#x27;ve moved on.<p>&gt; Sorry, btrfs, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to work out between us. Maybe in a different life.<p>ZFS has had a worse bug not even 4 months ago. They are both very good filesystems, bugs happen\n\nThe vast majority of databases currently recommend using XFS.\n\n  I&#x27;m very curious if there are any databases running in production environments on Btrfs or ZFS.\n\n    It wasn&#x27;t a company you&#x27;ve heard of, but I can absolutely tell you that there are:) We <i>really</i> benefited from compressing our postgres databases; not only did it save space, but in some cases it actually improved throughput because data could be read and uncompressed faster than the disks were physically capable of.<p>Edit: Also there was a time when it was normal for databases to be running on Solaris, in which case ZFS is expected; my recollection is that Sun even marketed how great of a combination that was.\n\n      Interesting.  The compression options that postgres offers itself were not enough?\n\n        It went the other way; we were using ZFS to protect against data errors, then found that it did compression as well. But looking now, the only native postgres options I see are TOAST, which seems to only work for certain data types in the database, and WAL compression (that&#x27;s only existed since pg 15), so unless I&#x27;ve missed something I would tend to say yes it&#x27;s far superior to the native options.\n\n          I mostly only looked into the options offered by MariaDB a while ago, and they seemed quite neat.  I had just assumed that postgres was at least on par.<p>Thanks for reporting!\n\n        postgres allows to compress only large text and blob column values.\n\n      Sun marketed the combination of PostgreSQL and ZFS quite heavily. But IIRC most of the success stories they presented involved what was decidedly non-OLTP read heavy workload with somewhat ridiculously large databases. One of the case studies even involved using PostgreSQL on ZFS as an archival layer for Oracle, with the observation that what is a large Oracle database is medium-sized one for PostgreSQL (and probably even more so if it is read mostly and on ZFS).<p>Sunhad some recommendations for tuning PostgreSQL performance on ZFS, but the recommendations seemed weird or even wrong for OLTP on top of CoW filesystem (I assume that these recommendations were meant for the above mentioned DWH&#x2F;archival scenarios).\n\n    Only 12 pages. Oracle database on ZFS best practices.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;technetwork&#x2F;server-storage&#x2F;solaris10&#x2F;config-solaris-zfs-wp-167894.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;technetwork&#x2F;server-storage&#x2F;solaris10&#x2F;...</a>\n\n    afaik meta (who are very large btrfs user) do not use it with mysql but do use it with rocksdb backends.<p>i think you can tweak it to make high random write load less painful but it generally will struggle with that.\n\n    We&#x27;re using BTRFS to host PostgreSQL and MySQL replication slaves. We&#x27;re snapshoting drives holding data for both every 15 minutes, 1h, 8h and 12h and keep few snapshots for each frequency.<p>Those replicas are not used for any workload, besides nightly consistency checks for MySQLs via pt-table-checksum to ensure we don&#x27;t have data drift.<p>Snapshots are crash consistent. Once in a while they give us ability to very quickly inspect how data looked like few minutes or hours ago. This can be life-saver in case of fat-fingering a production data and saved us from lenghty grepping of backups when we needed to recover few records from a specific table.<p>Yes, I know soft deletes, audit logs - all of those could help and we do have them, but sometimes that&#x27;s not enough or not feasible.<p>Due to it&#x27;s COW nature BTRFS is far from perfect for data that changes all the time [ databases busy with writes, images of VMs with plenty of disk write activity ]. There&#x27;s plenty of write amplification, but that can be solved with NVMe drives thrown on the problem.\n\n      How do you avoid heavy fragmentation caused by random writes? Do you disable COW (sounds like &quot;no&quot;, given you snapshot)? Or autodefrag (how&#x27;s performance)?\n\n  All modern databases do large block streaming appending writes, and small random reads, usually of just a handful of files.<p>It ought to be easy to design a filesystem which can have pretty much zero overhead for those two operations.    I&#x27;m kinda disappointed that every filesystem doesn&#x27;t perform identically for the database workload.<p>I totally understand that different file systems would do different tradeoffs affecting directory listing, tiny file creation&#x2F;deletion, traversing deep directory trees, etc.   But random reads of a huge file ought to perform near identically to the underlying storage medium.\n\n    What you’re describing is basically ext4. I do know there are some proprietary databases that use raw block devices. The downside being that you also need to make your own user space utilities for inspecting and managing it.\n\nBtrfs seems to work perfectly well in synology NAS. It must be some other combination of options or functions in use from what is available in synology that garners the bad reputation\n\n  Synology uses BTRFS weirdly, on top of dmraid, which negates the most well-known BTRFS bugs in their RAID5&#x2F;6 implementation*. Best I can tell they also have some custom modifications in their implementation as well, though it&#x27;s hard to find much info on it.<p>* FWIW, I used native BTRFS RAID5 for years and never had an issue but that&#x27;s just anecdata\n\nThis bug is very very rare in practice: all my dev and testing machines run btrfs, and I haven&#x27;t hit it once in 100+ machine-hours of running on 6.8-rc.<p>The actual patch is buried at the end the article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;linux-btrfs&#x2F;1ca6e688950ee82b1526bb3098852af99b75e6ba.1710551459.git.tavianator@tavianator.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;linux-btrfs&#x2F;1ca6e688950ee82b1526bb30...</a>\n\n  Do they run btrfs on top of dm-crypt?  I suspect it&#x27;s impossible to reproduce on a regular block device.\n\n    Yes, most of them do, precisely because I&#x27;m trying to catch more bugs :)\n\n    Did this ever trip any of the debugging ASSERT stuff for you? I&#x27;m  really curious if some more generic debugging instrument might be able to flag this failure mode more explicitly, it&#x27;s far from the first ABA problem with -&gt;bflags.<p>Also, if you don&#x27;t mind sharing your kconfig that would be interesting to see too.\n\n      No, but I may have been missing some debugging CONFIGs.  I was just using the stock Arch kconfig.<p>I did submit a patch to add a WARN_ON() for this case: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;linux-btrfs&#x2F;d4a055317bdb8ecbd7e6d9bdb5ebb074fa93f7f8.1710769876.git.tavianator@tavianator.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;linux-btrfs&#x2F;d4a055317bdb8ecbd7e6d9bd...</a><p>But to catch the general class of bugs you&#x27;d need something like KCSAN.  I did try that but the kernel is not KCSAN-clean so it was hard to know if any reports were relevant.\n\n        The WARN is great.<p>Something as general as KCSAN isn&#x27;t necessary: it&#x27;s a classic ABA problem, double checking the -&gt;bflags value on transitions is sufficient to catch it. Like a lockdep-style thing where *_bit() are optionally replaced by helpers that check the current value and WARN if the transition is unexpected.<p>Using the event numbering from your patch description, such a thing would have flagged seeing UPTODATE at (2). But the space of invalid transitions is is much larger than the space of valid ones, which is why I think it might help catch other future bugs sooner.<p>Dunno if it&#x27;s actually worth it, but I definitely recall bugs of this flavor in the past. It&#x27;ll take some work to unearth them all, alas...\n\n          I like that idea, but it isn&#x27;t really compatible with my fix.  `bflags` still makes the same transitions, I just skip the actual read in the `UPTODATE | READING` case.\n\n            I think after your fix the set of valid states in that spot would just include UPTODATE. But this is all very poorly thought out on my part...\n\n  100 error-free machine hours isn’t exactly evidence of anything when it comes to FS bugs, though.\n\n    Of course it is: it&#x27;s evidence the average person will never hit this bug. Statistics, and all that.<p>Having worked on huge deployments of Linux servers before, I can tell you that modelling race condition bugs as having a uniform random chance of happening per unit time is <i>shockingly</i> predictive. But it&#x27;s not proof, obviously.\n\n      &gt; modelling race condition bugs as having a uniform random chance of happening per unit time is shockingly predictive<p>I don&#x27;t generally disagree with that methodology, but 100 hours is just not a lot of time.<p>If you have a condition that takes, on average, 1000 hours to occur, you have a 9 in 10 chance of missing it based on 100 error-free hours observed, and yet it will still affect nearly 100% of all of your users after a bit more than a month!<p>For file systems, the aim should be (much more than) five nines, not nine fives.\n\n        &gt; If you have a condition that takes, on average, 1000 hours to occur, you have a 9 in 10 chance of missing it based on 100 error-free hours observed<p>Yes. Which means 9&#x2F;10 users who used their machines 100 or fewer hours on the new kernel will never hit the hypothetical bug. Thank you for proving my point!<p>I&#x27;m not a filesystem developer, I&#x27;m a user: as a user, I don&#x27;t care about the long tail, I only care about the average case as it relates to my deployment size. As you correctly point out, my deployment is of negligible size, and the long tail is far far beyond my reach.<p>Aside: your hypothetical event has a 0.1% chance of happening each hour. That means it has a 99.9% chance of not happening each hour. The odds it doesn&#x27;t happen after 100 hours is 0.999^100, or 90.5%. I think you know that, I just don&#x27;t want a casual reader to infer it&#x27;s 90% because 1-(100&#x2F;1000) is 0.9.\n\n          &gt; Which means 9&#x2F;10 users who used their machines 100 or fewer hours on the new kernel will never hit the bug.<p>No, that&#x27;s not how probabilities work at all for a bug that happens with uniform probability (i.e. <i>not</i> bugs that deterministically happen after n hours since boot). If you have millions of users, some of them will hit it within hours or even minutes after boot!<p>&gt; As you correctly point out, my deployment is of negligible size, and the long tail is far far beyond my reach.<p>So you don&#x27;t expect to accrue on the order of 1000 machine-hours in your deployment? That&#x27;s only a month for a single machine, or half a week for 10. That would be way too much for me even for my home server RPi, let alone anything that holds customer data.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not a filesystem developer, I&#x27;m a user: I don&#x27;t care about the long tail, I only care about the average case as it relates to my deployment size.<p>Yes, but unfortunately you seem to either have the math completely wrong or I&#x27;m not understanding your deployment properly.\n\n            &gt; So you don&#x27;t expect to accrue on the order of 1000 machine-hours in your deployment?<p>The 1000 number came from you. I have no idea where you got it from. I suspect the &quot;real number&quot; is several orders of magnitude higher, but I have no idea, and it&#x27;s sort of artificial in the first place.<p>My overarching point is that mine is such a vanishingly small portion of the universe of machines running btrfs that I am virtually guaranteed that bugs will be found and fixed before they affect me, exactly as happened here. Unless you run a rather large business, that&#x27;s probably true for you too.<p>The filesystem with the most users has the least bugs. Nothing with the feature set of btrfs has even 1% the real world deployment footprint it does.<p>&gt; If you have millions of users, some of them will hit it within hours or even minutes after boot!<p>This is weirdly sensationalist: I don&#x27;t get it. Nobody dies when their filesystem gets corrupted. Nobody even loses money, unless they&#x27;ve been negligent. At worst it&#x27;s a nuisance to restore a backup.\n\n              &gt; The 1000 number came from you. I have no idea where you got it from,<p>It&#x27;s an arbitrary example of an error rate you&#x27;d have a 90% chance of missing in your sample size of 100 machine-hours, yet much too high for almost any meaningful application.<p>I have no idea what the actual error rate of that btrfs bug is; my only point is that your original assertion of &quot;I&#x27;ve experienced 100 error-free hours, so this is a non-issue for me and my users&quot; is a non sequitur.<p>&gt; This is weirdly sensationalist: I don&#x27;t get it. Nobody dies when their filesystem gets corrupted. Nobody even loses money, unless they&#x27;ve been negligent.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to say to that other than that I wish I had your optimism on reliable system design practices across various industries.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a parallel universe where people treat every file system as having an error rate of something like &quot;data corruption&#x2F;loss once every four days&quot;, but it&#x27;s not the one I&#x27;m familiar with.<p>For better or worse, the bar for file system reliability is much, much, much, much higher than anything you could reasonably produce empirical data for unless you&#x27;re operating at Google&#x2F;AWS etc. scale.\n\n                &gt; &quot;I&#x27;ve experienced 100 error-free hours, so this is a non-issue for me and my users&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a statement of fact: it has been a non-issue for me. If you&#x27;re like me, it&#x27;s statistically reasonable to assume it will be a non-issue for you too. Also, no users, just me. &quot;Proabably okay&quot; is more than good enough for me, and I&#x27;m sure many people have similar requirements (clearly not you).<p>I have no optimism, just no empathy for the negligent: I learned my lesson with backups a long time ago. Some people blame the filesystem instead of their backup practices when their data is corrupted, but I think that&#x27;s naive. The filesystem did you a favor, fix your shit. Next time it will be your NAS power supply frying your storage.<p>It&#x27;s also a double edged sword: the more reliable a filesystem is, the longer users can get away without backups before being bitten, and the greater their ultimate loss will be.\n\n                  &gt; It&#x27;s a statement of fact: it has been a non-issue for me.<p>Yes...<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re like me, it&#x27;s statistically reasonable to assume it will be a non-issue for you too.<p>No! This simply does not follow from the first statement, statistically or otherwise.<p>You and I might or might not be fine; you having been fine for 100 hours on the same configuration just offers next-to-zero predictive power for that.\n\n                    &gt; No! This simply does not follow from the first statement, statistically or otherwise.<p>&gt; You and I might or might not be fine; you having been fine for 100 hours on the same configuration just offers next-to-zero predictive power for that.<p>You&#x27;re missing the forest for the trees here.<p>It is predictive <i>ON AVERAGE</i>. I don&#x27;t care about the worst case like you do: I only care about the <i>expected case</i>. If I died when my filesystem got corrupted... I would hope it&#x27;s obvious I wouldn&#x27;t approach it this way.<p>Adding to this: my laptop has this btrfs bug right now. I&#x27;m not going to do anything about it, because it&#x27;s not worth 20 minutes of my time to rebuild my kernel for a bug that is unlikely to bite before I get the fix in 6.9-rc1, and would only cost me 30 minutes of time in the worst case if it did.<p>I&#x27;ll update if it bites me. I&#x27;ve bet on much worse poker hands :)\n\n                      Well, from your data (100 error-free hours, sample size 1) alone, we can only conclude this: “The bug probably happens less frequently than every few hours”.<p>Is that reliable enough for you? Great! Is that “very rare”? Absolutely not for almost any type of user&#x2F;scenario I can imagine.<p>If you’re making any statistical arguments beyond that data, or are implying more data than that, please provide either, otherwise this will lead nowhere.\n\n                      &gt; I only care about the expected case.<p>The expected case after surviving a hundred hours is that you&#x27;re likely to survive another hundred.<p>Which is a completely useless promise.<p>That piece of data doesn&#x27;t let you predict anything at reasonable time scales for an OS install.<p>You can&#x27;t squeeze more implications out of such a small sample.\n\n                        I don&#x27;t care about the aggregate: I only care about me and my machine here.<p>&gt; The expected case after surviving a hundred hours is that you&#x27;re likely to survive another hundred.<p>That&#x27;s exactly right. I don&#x27;t expect to accrue another hundred hours before the new release, so I&#x27;ll likely be fine.<p>&gt; Which is a completely useless promise.<p>Statistics is never a promise: that&#x27;s a really naive concept.<p>&gt; at reasonable time scales for an OS<p>The timescale of the OS install is irrelevant: all that matters is the time between when the bug is introduced and when it is fixed. In this case, about nine months.\n\n                          You only use your machines for twenty hours per month?<p>Even so, &quot;likely&quot; here is something like &quot;better than 50:50&quot;.  Your claim was &quot;very very rare&quot; and that&#x27;s not supported by the evidence.<p>&gt; Statistics is never a promise: that&#x27;s a really naive concept.<p>It&#x27;s a promise of odds with error bars, don&#x27;t be so nitpicky.\n\n                            &gt; Even so, &quot;likely&quot; here is something like &quot;better than 50:50&quot;. Your claim was &quot;very very rare&quot; and that&#x27;s not supported by the evidence.<p>You&#x27;re free to disagree, obviously, but I think it&#x27;s accurate to describe a race condition that doesn&#x27;t happen in 100 hours on a multiple machines with clock rates north of 3GHz as &quot;very very rare&quot;. That particular code containing the bug has probably executed tens of millions of times on my little pile of machines alone.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a promise of odds with error bars, don&#x27;t be so nitpicky.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m not being nitpicky, the word &quot;promise&quot; is entirely inapplicable to statistics.\n\n                              If my computer has a filesystem error that happens every week of uptime (168 machine hours), I call that &quot;common&quot;.\n\n              &gt; Nothing with the feature set of btrfs has even 1% the real world deployment footprint it does.<p>So you haven&#x27;t heard of zfs then?\n\n          A single 9 in reliability over 100 hours would be colossally bad for a filesystem. For the average office user, 100 hours is not even a month&#x27;s worth of daily use.<p>Even as an anecdote this is completely useless. A couple thousand hours and dozens of mount&#x2F;unmount cycles would just be a good start.\n\n          &gt; Yes. Which means 9&#x2F;10 users who used their machines 100 or fewer hours on the new kernel will never hit the hypothetical bug. Thank you for proving my point!<p>So....that&#x27;s really bad.\n\n        You edited this in after I replied, or maybe I missed it:<p>&gt; If you have a condition that takes, on average, 1000 hours to occur, you have a 9 in 10 chance of missing it based on 100 error-free hours observed, and yet it will still affect nearly 100% of all of your users after a bit more than a month!<p>I understand the point you&#x27;re trying to make here, but 1000 is just an incredibly unrealistically small number if we&#x27;re modelling bugs like that. The real number might be on the order of millions. The effect you&#x27;re describing in real life might take decades: weeks is unrealistic.\n\n          I agree that a realistic error rate for this particular bug is much lower than 1 in 1000 hours (or it would have long been caught by others).<p>But that makes your evidence of 100 error-free hours <i>even less useful</i> to make any predictions about stability!\n\n            &gt; But that makes your evidence of 100 error-free hours even less useful to make any predictions about stability!<p>You&#x27;re still conflating probabilities an event occurs across a group with the probability an event happens to one specific individual in that group (in this case, me). I&#x27;m talking about the second thing, and it&#x27;s very much not the same.<p>If I could rewind the universe and replay it many many times, some portion of those times I will either be very lucky or very unlucky, and get an initial testing result that badly mispredicts my personal future. <i>But we know that most of the time, I won&#x27;t</i>.<p>I can actually prove that. Because of the simple assumptions we&#x27;re making, we can directly compute the probabilities we are initially that wrong:<p><pre><code>  Odds we test 1000-hour bug for 1000 hours without tripping: 0.999^1000 = 36.7%\n  Odds we test 50-hour bug for 100 hours without tripping: 0.98^100 = 13.3%\n  Odds we test 10-hour bug for 100 hours without tripping: 0.9^100 = 0.002%\n</code></pre>\nUnder our spherical cow assumptions, my 100 hours is a <i>very convincing</i> demonstration the real bug rate is less than one per 10 hours.<p>Of course, in the real world, you might never hit the bug because you have to pat yourself on the head while singing Louie Louie and making three concurrent statx() calls on prime numbered CPUs with buffers off-by-one from 1GB alignment while Mars is in the fifth house to trigger it... it&#x27;s just a model, after all.\n\n      &gt; Of course it is: it&#x27;s evidence the average person will never hit this bug. Statistics, and all that.<p>Anecdotal statistics maybe.\n\n      If I&#x27;m running btrfs on my NAS, that&#x27;s only ~4 days of runtime. If there&#x27;s a bug that trashes the filesystem every month on average, that&#x27;s really bad and yet is very unlikely to get caught in 4 days of running.\n\n      You do understand that 100 hours is not even 5 days, right?\n\n      I&#x27;ve been running a public file server[0] on a 1994 vintage PowerBook 540c running Macintosh System 7.5 using the HFS file system on an SD card (via a SCSI2SD adapter) for like 400 hours straight this month, with zero issues.<p>Not once would I even insinuate that after my 400 hours of experience, HFS is a file system people should rely on.<p>100 hours says nothing. When I read your comment I just assumed that you had typoed 100 machine-years (as in running a server farm) as that would have been far more relevant.<p>[0] Participating in the MARCHintosh GlobalTalk worldwide AppleTalk network full of vintage computers and emulators\n\n    At first I thought jcalvinowens meant they had actively tried to reproduce this bug for 100 machine hours, which would lend credence to &quot;very very rare in practice&quot;.  But in 100 machine hours of a typical workload doesn&#x27;t really show anything about this bug.  Also the bug was introduced in v6.5, so very very many btrfs users have avoided this bug for far longer than 100 machine hours.<p>I do agree it&#x27;s &quot;very very rare in practice&quot;.  You need at least 3 threads racing on the same disk block in a ~15 instruction window, during which time you need the other thread to <i>start and finish reading a block from disk</i>.  Which means you need very fast I&#x2F;O <i>and decryption</i> and enough CPU oversubscription to get preempted in the race window.  And it only happens when you actually hit disk which means once your machine is in a steady state, most metadata blocks you need will already be cached and you&#x27;ll never see the bug.<p>That said, this is not some crazy 1-instruction race window with preemption disabled.  With enough threads calling statx() in parallel and regularly dropping caches, I can reproduce it consistently within a few minutes.  Way less than 100 hours :)\n\n      &gt; But in 100 machine hours of a typical workload doesn&#x27;t really show anything about this bug<p>It does though: it shows it isn&#x27;t a dire usability problem. A machine with this bug is still able to do meaningful work, it just might eat it&#x27;s own tail occasionally.<p>If I ran N servers with this bug and had an automated thing to whack them when they tripped over it, how many would be out of commission at any given time? All signs point to it being a pretty small number. As long as data loss isn&#x27;t a concern, a sysadmin would probably choose to wait a couple weeks for the fix through the proper channels, rather than going to a lot of trouble to do it immediately themselves (which also carries risk).<p>This is also why I was curious about kconfig: my test boxes have all the hardening options turned on right now, I could see how that might make it less likely to trigger.<p>I completely agree the &quot;uniform random bug&quot; model is only so useful, since an artificial reproducer obviously blows it out of the water. But as I said elsewhere, I&#x27;ve seen it be shockingly predictive when applied to large numbers of machines with bugs like this.\n\nAs someone who uses a rolling release, I use btrfs because I don&#x27;t want to deal with keeping ZFS up to date.<p>It&#x27;s been really good for me.  And btrbk is the best backup solution I&#x27;ve had on Linux, btrfs send&#x2F;receive is a lot faster than rsync even when sending non-incremental snapshots.\n\n  Same here: I use a rolling release and btrfs. Personally I really enjoy btrfs&#x27;s snapshot feature. Most of the time when I need backups it&#x27;s not because of a hardware failure but because of a fat finger mistake where I rm&#x27;ed a file I need. Periodic snapshots completely solved that problem for me.<p>(Of course, backing up to another disk is absolutely still needed, but you probably need it less than you think.)\n\n  &gt; I don&#x27;t want to deal with keeping ZFS up to date<p>That&#x27;s what DKMS is for, which most distros use for ZFS.  Install and forget.\n\n    I think the larger issue is that openzfs doesn&#x27;t move in sync with the kernel so you have to check <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;master&#x2F;META\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;master&#x2F;META</a> to make sure you can actually upgrade each time.  On a rolling distro this is a pretty common breakage AFAIK.  It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is annoying.\n\n  Depends on the rolling release; some distros specifically provide a kernel package that is still rolling, but is also always the latest version compatible with ZFS.\n\nreminder that btrfs stands for butter filesystem and not better filesystem\n\nI had my &#x2F;home on a subvolume (great as the sub and super share the same space).<p>When I wanted to reinstall I naively thought I could format the root super volume and keep &#x2F;home subvolume -- but this was impossible: I had to format &#x2F;home as well according to the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed installer.<p>Major problem for me. I now have separate root (btrfs) and home (ext4) partitions.\n\n  You can do it but it&#x27;s not a very happy path. Easiest way is probably to map the old home subvolume into a different path and either re-label the subvolumes once you&#x27;re installed or just copy everything over.<p>Separate BTRFS root and ext4 home partitions is either the default filesystem layout now if you&#x27;re not doing FDE or the second recommended one.\n\n    I do disk encryption of root and home. Not of boot and swap (the attack needed to steal my data in that scenario is too involved: according to my assessment my data is not that valuable)\n\n  That&#x27;s how subvolumes work; not just on btrfs, but on zfs as well.<p>The non-footgun way is to have several subvolumes (@root, @boot, @home for btrfs, rpool&#x2F;ROOT&#x2F;system_instance and rpool&#x2F;USERDATA for zfs), and nothing in else in the volume itself. Then, you wipe the system subvolume and create a new one, with new system. Or just keep the old system subvolume and create a new one.\n\nI really wish you could use custom filesystems such as btrfs with WSL2. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s currently any way to do snapshotting, which means you can never be sure a backup taken within WSL is corrupt.\n\n  Can this be used? I knew ReactOS would use it natively.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maharmstone&#x2F;btrfs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maharmstone&#x2F;btrfs</a>\n\n    Maybe that could be adapted, but I don&#x27;t think it would solve my problem currently. Basically I want to be able to do btrfs snapshots from within my WSL distros, so that I can run restic or similar on the snapshots.\n\n  Hell, even just being able to use XFS would be an improvement, because ext4 has painful degradation scenarios when you hit cases like exhausting the inode count.<p>(Somewhat related, but there has been a WIP 6.1 kernel for WSL2 &quot;in preview&quot; for a while now... I wonder why it hasn&#x27;t become the default considering both it and 5.12 are LTS... For filesystems like btrfs I often want a newer kernel to pick up every bugfix.)\n\n  You can, it&#x27;s just a bit of a pain.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bryanroessler.com&#x2F;2020-12-14-btrfs-on-wsl2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bryanroessler.com&#x2F;2020-12-14-btrfs-on-wsl2&#x2F;</a>\n\n    Nice. Unfortunately for my use case I can&#x27;t use physical storage devices. I need a something similar to a qcow2 that can be created and completely managed by my app.\n\n  Hope that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;veeam&#x2F;blksnap&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;veeam&#x2F;blksnap&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2</a> becomes available soon. It&#x27;s on v7 of posting to linux-block and will make snapshotting available for all block devices.\n\n    This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of blksnap. Looks very interesting. There&#x27;s not much documentation in the repo. Am I understanding correctly that if I were to build a custom WSL kernel with those patches, I would be able to do snapshotting in WSL today?<p>Can you give or link to a brief description of how blksnap works?\n\n      You could do block device snapshotting today if you build your block devices on top of LVM. You can also somewhat do it with fsfreeze and remounting your mount point on top of a dm-snapshot target.<p>Blksnap is better because it does not require setup in advance like LVM, and it does not require interrupting any live users like fsfreeze. It &quot;should&quot; just work with the live block device within the WSL distro.<p>LWN covered the v1 posting, which is a good start: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;914031&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;914031&#x2F;</a><p>This is all somewhat future-looking, and if you only want file-level snapshotting instead of block-level, it&#x27;s probably easier to try and get btrfs&#x2F;bcachefs&#x2F;nilfs2 instead. My WSL2 on Windows 11 shows btrfs present inside &#x2F;proc&#x2F;filesystems.\n\n        To piggyback on this:<p>In the 2024 century the default LVM setup still does not offer to leave some spare space on the volume group. Without that unallocated space it&#x27;s impossible to create snapshots for LVs.<p>Oh, and the change-tracking function is non existent for both LVM and dev mapper!\n\n      I think this doc is pretty concise:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;veeam&#x2F;blksnap&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;doc&#x2F;blksnap.md\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;veeam&#x2F;blksnap&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;doc&#x2F;blksnap.md</a>\n\n    Well, sadly the latest patch submission haven&#x27;t got too much traction (nada, to be precise) or attention from the maintainers:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patchwork.kernel.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;linux-block&#x2F;cover&#x2F;20240209160204.1471421-1-sergei.shtepa@linux.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patchwork.kernel.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;linux-block&#x2F;cover&#x2F;20240...</a>\n\nThe visualisation of the data race in this post is superb. Worth reading just for that.<p>Handrolled concurrency using atomic integers in C. Without the proof system or state machine model to support it. Seems likely that&#x27;s not going to be their only race condition.\n\n  The animations also stood out to me. I took a look at the source to see if they used a library or were written completely by hand and was surprised to see that they were entirely CSS-based, no JavaScript required (although the &quot;metadata&quot; overwrite animation is glitched if you disable JS, for some reason not immediately apparent to me).\n\n    &gt; for some reason not immediately apparent to me<p>The CSS that sets the background of the code elements (so they properly cover up the ones under them) is attached to the hljs class, which is added to those elements by highlight.js.<p>No JS &gt; no classname added &gt; no background style &gt; jank\n\n      Thanks for pointing this out to me!  I&#x27;ll see if I can pre-render the syntax highlighting like I do with KaTeX and stuff.  No reason to do that on the client.\n\n  Anybody know how the visualisation was done?\n\n    I did it by hand with CSS: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tavianator&#x2F;tavianator.com&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;2024&#x2F;btrfs_bug.md?plain=1#L248\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tavianator&#x2F;tavianator.com&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;2...</a>\n\n      Dang, that seems like a lot of effort. It looks great though and it&#x27;s such a big help for understanding something like this. I wonder if there are tools to automate this sort of thing. Like, is there a debugger that could highlight code that it passes through and when?\n\n  That not-invented-here locking mechanism was a big shock to me. I&#x27;d be very interested to know the rationale behind that, are locking primitives somehow not available in file system code?\n\n    Locks are perfectly usable in filesystem code, but test_and_set_bit()&#x2F;wait_on_bit() has lower overhead, so they&#x27;ll get used as an optimization.  This function is called on every metadata read, so the improved performance&#x2F;scalability of raw atomics over locks can probably make a difference on fast storage.<p>Also the code used to use locks, and it wasn&#x27;t any simpler: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;linux-btrfs&#x2F;20230503152441.1141019-21-hch@lst.de&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;linux-btrfs&#x2F;20230503152441.1141019-2...</a>\n\n  This looks like the sort of bug I&#x27;d write back when I used mutexes to write I&#x2F;O routines.  These days, I&#x27;d use a lock-free state machine to encode something like this:<p><pre><code>   NOT_IN_CACHE -&gt; READING -&gt; IN_CACHE\n</code></pre>\n(the real system would need states for cache eviction, and possibly page mutation).<p>Readers that encounter the READING state would insert a completion handler into a queue, and readers transitioning out of the READING state would wake up all the completion handlers in the queue.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on an open source library and simple (manual) proof system that makes it easy to verify that the queue manipulation and the state machine manipulation are atomic with respect to each other:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;atomic-try-update&#x2F;0.0.2&#x2F;atomic_try_update&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;atomic-try-update&#x2F;0.0.2&#x2F;atomic_try_update&#x2F;</a><p>The higher level invariants are fairly obvious once you show that the interlocks are correct, and showing the interlocks are correct is just a matter of a quick skim of the function bodies that implement the interlocks for a given data type.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking for good write ups of these techniques, but haven&#x27;t found any.\n\n    The existing btrfs code does use a lock-free state machine for this, `eb-&gt;bflags`, that sort of mirrors regular page flags (hence `UPTODATE`, `DIRTY`, etc.).<p>But Linux kernel APIs like test_bit(), set_bit(), clear_bit(), test_and_set_bit() etc. only work on one bit at a time.  The advantage is they can avoid a CAS loop on many platforms.  The disadvantage is you only get atomic transitions for one bit at a time.  So the `READING -&gt; UPTODATE` transition is more like<p><pre><code>    READING -&gt; (READING | UPTODATE) -&gt; UPTODATE\n</code></pre>\nAnd the `NOT_IN_CACHE -&gt; READING` transition is not fully atomic at all:<p><pre><code>    if (!(bflags &amp; UPTODATE)) &#x2F;&#x2F; atomic\n                              &#x2F;&#x2F; race could happen here\n        bflags |= READING;    &#x2F;&#x2F; atomic\n</code></pre>\nThe whole state machine could be made atomic with CAS, but that would be (slightly) more expensive.\n\nI&#x27;ve been overall very happy with:\n- Arch on BTRFS RAID1 root, across 3 dissimilar NVME drives (about 7 years, 3 drive replacements for hardware failure, I don&#x27;t think ZFS supports this configuration)\n- numerous low-power systems (like Pi3s) on BTRFS root (also going on 7 years for several of these, lighter on resources than ZFS)\n- Asahi NixOS on BTRFS root (kernel doesn&#x27;t support ZFS)<p>My NAS and several larger datasets are on ZFS based on reputation alone, but honestly I&#x27;ve had more data loss scares with ZFS than BTRFS (drives that have disappeared for no reason then reappeared hours later, soft locked and unable to unmount indefinitely, several unfortunate user-error issues with automounting datasets overlaying necessary top-level directories and preventing successful boots), and I find the BTRFS tooling more intuitive.<p>For my hobbyist-level homelab type needs, I would say I&#x27;m overall pretty happy with BTRFS. The only issue I&#x27;ve never been able to resolve is regarding lockups when issuing quotas -- another reason I stick to ZFS for my spinning rust storage drives.<p>Oh, and the ZFS ability to mount a zvol as a foreign filesystem (words?) lets me `btrfs send` backups to ZFS, which is nice!\n\n  &gt; about 7 years, 3 drive replacements for hardware failure<p>You&#x27;ve had 3 SSD failures in just 7 years? Any more details about those disks?\n\n    Cheap NVME drives.<p>And to be fair, 2 of 3 were only <i>suspicious</i> for having a hardware problem so I replaced with a larger drive (and was super nice to have such a straightforward was to expand the size as compared to ZFS)."

From my memory this was standardised in 1996 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1996).<p>The work originally came from work by Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1950s. It was introduced into Unix fame via the QED editor (which later became ed (and sed), then ex, then vi, then vim; all with differing authors) when Ken Thompson added regex when he ported QED to CTSS (an OS developed at MIT for the IBM 709, which was later used to develop Multics, and hence lead to Unix).<p>Also the &quot;grep&quot; command got its name from &quot;ed&quot;; &quot;g&quot; (the global ed command) &quot;re&quot; (regular expression), and &quot;p&quot; (the print ed command). Try it in vi&#x2F;vim, :g&#x2F;string&#x2F;p it is the same thing as the grep command.\n\n      &gt;<i>you can usually pass sed a -r flag</i><p>for portability, -E is the POSIX flag for the same thing\n\n  &quot;$&quot; could be end of string or end of line in perl, depending on the setting (are you treating data as a multiline text, or each line separately). (&#x2F;m, &#x2F;s,...)\n\n    Yeah I accidentally said string when I absolutely meant to say line there.\n\nThe new-line character is an actual character &quot;at the end&quot; of the string though so it makes sense that $ would include the new-line character in multi-line matching.\n\n  Yes and every implementation gets that right. The point was when multi-line matching is <i>disabled</i> and only Javascript, Go and Rust get that right.<p>I&#x27;m not too surprised by PHP and Python getting it wrong. Java and C# is a slight surprise though.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think it is correct to say some get it right and some get it wrong, it is more of an design decision.\n\n      It&#x27;s possible to get design decisions wrong. Clearly people <i>expect</i> `$` to only match end-of-string so they did make the wrong decision. It may not have been clear it was the wrong decision at the time.\n\n        Things are obviously more complicated than that, lines are a complicated issue for historical reasons. There are two conventions, line termination and line separation. In case of line termination, the newline is part of the line and a string without a newline is not a [complete] line. In case of line separation, the newline is not part of the line but separates two lines. Also the way newlines are encoded is not universal.\n\n          Why is this relevant when multi-line is disabled?\n\n            Because even after disabling multi-line you are still dealing with line-based semantics when you use ^ or $, the newline at the end is still not part of the content. You have to use \\A and \\Z if you want to treat all characters as a string instead of one or multiple lines.\n\n              &gt; Because even after disabling multi-line you are still dealing with line-based semantics when you use ^ or $<p>No, you&#x27;re not, <i>except</i> for this weird corner case where `$` can match before the <i>last</i> `\\n` in a string. It&#x27;s not just any `\\n` that non-multiline `$` can match before. It&#x27;s when it&#x27;s the <i>last</i> `\\n` in the string. See:<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(&#x27;cat$&#x27;, &#x27;cat\\n&#x27;)\n    &lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match=&#x27;cat&#x27;&gt;\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(&#x27;cat$&#x27;, &#x27;cat\\n\\n&#x27;)\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThis is weird behavior. I assume this is why RE2 didn&#x27;t copy this. And it&#x27;s certainly why I followed RE2 with Rust&#x27;s regex crate. Non-multiline `$` should only match at the end of the string. It should not be line-aware. In regex engines like Python where it has the behavior above, it is only &quot;partially&quot; line-aware, and only in the sense that it treats the last `\\n` as special.\n\n                But that is exactly what it means, the end of the line is before the terminating newline or at the end of the string if there is no terminating newline. Both ^ and $ always match at start or end of lines, \\A and \\Z match at the start or end of the string. The difference between multi-line and not is whether or not internal newlines end and start lines, it does not change the semantics from end of line to end of string. And if you are not in multi-line mode but have internal newlines, then you might also want single-line&#x2F;dot-all mode.<p>One could certainly have a debate whether this behavior is too strongly tied to the origins of regular expressions and now does more harm than good, but I am not convinced that this would be an easy and obvious choice to have breaking change.\n\n                  &gt; But that is exactly what it means<p>I think you&#x27;ve kind of missed the point. Sure if `$` in non-multiline mode means &quot;end of line&quot; the behaviour might be reasonable. But the big error is that people DO NOT EXPECT `$` to mean &quot;end of line&quot; in that case. They expect it to mean &quot;end of string&quot;. That&#x27;s clearly the least surprising and most useful behaviour.<p>The bug is not in how they have implemented &quot;end of line&quot; matching in non-multiline mode. It&#x27;s that they did it at all.\n\n                  re.search does not accept a &quot;line.&quot; It accepts a &quot;string.&quot; There is no pretext in which re.search is meant to only accept a single line. And giving it a `string` with multiple new lines doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you want to enable multi-line mode. They are orthogonal things.<p>&gt; Both ^ and $ always match at start or end of lines<p>This is trivially not true, as I showed in my previous example. The haystack `cat\\n\\n` contains two lines and the regex `cat$` says it should match `cat` followed by the &quot;end of a line&quot; according to your definition. Yet it does not match `cat` followed by the end of a line in `cat\\n\\n`. And it does not do so in Python or in any other regex engine.<p>You&#x27;re trying to square a circle here. It can&#x27;t be done.<p>Can you make sense of, <i>historically</i>, why this choice of semantics was made? Sure. I bet you can. But I can still evaluate the choice on its own merits today. And I did when I made the regex crate.<p>&gt; but I am not convinced that this would be an easy and obvious choice to have breaking change.<p>Rust&#x27;s regex crate, Go&#x27;s regexp package and RE2 all reject this whacky behavior. As the regex crate maintainer, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone complain. Not once. This to me suggests that, at minimum, making `$` and `\\z` equivalent in non-multiline mode is a reasonable choice. I would also argue it is the better and more sensible approach.<p>Whether other regex engines should have a breaking change or not to change the meaning of `$` is an entirely different question completely. That is neither here nor there. They absolutely will not be able to make such a change, for many good reasons.\n\n                    <i>re.search does not accept a &quot;line.&quot; It accepts a &quot;string.&quot; There is no pretext in which re.search is meant to only accept a single line.</i><p>Sure, it takes a string which might be a line or multiple or whatever. Does not change the fact that $ matches at the end of a line. If you want the end of the string, use \\Z.<p><i>This is trivially not true, as I showed in my previous example. The haystack `cat\\n\\n` contains two lines and the regex `cat$` says it should match `cat` followed by the &quot;end of a line&quot; according to your definition.</i><p>In multi-line mode it matches, in single-line mode it does not because there is a newline between cat and the end of the line. A newline is only a terminating newline if it is the last character, the newline after cat is not a terminating newline. You need cat\\n$ or cat\\n\\n to match.\n\n                      &gt; In multi-line mode it matches, in single-line mode it does not because there is a newline between cat and the end of the line. A newline is only a terminating newline if it is the last character, the newline after cat is not a terminating newline. You need cat\\n$ or cat\\n\\n to match.<p>This only makes sense if re.search accepted a line to search. It doesn&#x27;t. It accepts an arbitrary string.<p>I don&#x27;t think this conversation is going anywhere. Your description of the semantics seems inconsistent and incomprehensible to me.<p>&gt; A newline is only a terminating newline if it is the last character, the newline after cat is not a terminating newline. You need cat\\n$ or cat\\n\\n to match.<p>The first `\\n` in `cat\\n\\n` <i>is</i> a terminating newline. There just happens to be one after it.<p>Like I said, your description makes sense <i>if</i> the input is meant to be interpreted as a single line. And in some contexts (like line oriented CLI tools), that can make sense. But that&#x27;s <i>not</i> the case here. So your description makes no sense at all to me.\n\n                        <i>This only makes sense if re.search accepted a line to search. It doesn&#x27;t. It accepts an arbitrary string.</i><p>Which is fine because lines are a subset of strings. And whether you want your input treated as a line or a string is decided by your pattern, use ^ and $ and it will be treated as a line, use \\A and \\Z and it will be treated as a string.<p><i>The first `\\n` in `cat\\n\\n` is a terminating newline. There just happens to be one after it.</i><p>Look at where this is coming from. You do line-based stuff, there is either no newline at all or there is exactly one newline at the end. You do file-based stuff, there are many newlines. In both cases the behavior of ^ and $ makes perfect sense.<p>Now you come along with cat\\n\\n which clearly falls into the file-based stuff category as it has more than one newline in it but you also insist that it is not multiple lines. If it is not multiple lines, then only the last character can be a newline, otherwise it would be multiple lines.<p>And I get it, yes, you can throw arbitrary strings at a regular expression, this line-based processing is not everything, but it explains why things behave the way they do. And that is also why people added \\A and \\Z. And I understand that ^ and $ are much nicer and much better known than \\A and \\Z. Maybe the best option would be to have a separate flag that makes them synonymous with \\A and \\Z and this could maybe even be the default.\n\n                          &gt; And whether you want your input treated as a line or a string is decided by your pattern, use ^ and $ and it will be treated as a line, use \\A and \\Z and it will be treated as a string.<p>Where is this semantic explained in the `re` module docs?<p>This is totally and completely made up as far as I can tell.<p>This also seems entirely consistent with my rebuttal:<p>Me: What you&#x27;re saying makes sense <i>if</i> condition foo holds.<p>You: Condition foo holds.<p>This is uninteresting to me because I see no reason to believe that condition foo holds. Where condition foo is &quot;the input to re.search is expected to be a single line.&quot; Or more precisely, apparently, &quot;the input to re.search is expected to be a single line when either ^ or $ appear in the pattern.&quot; That is totally bonkers.<p>&gt; but it explains why things behave the way they do<p>Firstly, I am not debating with you about the historical reasoning for this. Secondly, I am providing a commentary on the semantics themselves (they suck) and also on your explanation of them in <i>today&#x27;s</i> context (it doesn&#x27;t make sense). Thirdly, I am not making a prescriptive argument that established regex engines should change their behavior in any way.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to explain <i>why</i> this semantic is the way it is, then I&#x27;d expect writing from the original implementors of it. Probably in Perl. I wouldn&#x27;t at all be surprised if this was an &quot;oops&quot; or if it was implemented in a strictly-line-oriented context, and then someone else decided to keep it unthinkingly when they moved to a non-line-oriented context. From there, compatibility takes over as a reason for why it&#x27;s with us today.\n\n                            I quoted the section from the Python module here. [1]<p>If you do not specify multi-line, bar$ matches a lines ending in bar, either foobar\\n or foobar if the terminating newline has been removed or does not exist. If you specify multi-line, then it will also match at every bar\\n within the string. So it either treats your input as a single line or as multiple lines. You can of course not specify multi-line and still pass in a string with additional newlines within the string, but then those newlines will be treated more or less as any other character, bar$ will not match bar\\n\\n. The exception is that dot will not match them except you set the single-line&#x2F;dot-all flag, bar\\n$  will match bar\\n\\n but bar.$ will not unless you specify the single-line&#x2F;dot-all flag.<p>I would even agree with you that it seems a bit weird. If you have a proper line without additional newlines in the middle, then multi-line behaves exactly like not multi-line. Not multi-line only behaves differently if you confront it with multiple lines and I have no good idea how you would end up in a situation where you have multiple lines and want to treat them as one unit but still treat the entire thing as if it was a line.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39765086\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39765086</a>\n\n                              The docs do not say what you&#x27;re saying. Your phrasing is completely different, and the part where &quot;if ^&#x2F;$ are in the pattern then the haystack is treated as a single line&quot; is completely made up. As far as I can tell, that&#x27;s your <i>rationalization</i> for how to make sense of this behavior. But it is not a story supported by the actual regex engine docs. The actual docs say, &quot;^ matches only at the beginning of the string, and $ matches only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string.&quot; The docs do not say, &quot;the string is treated as a single line when ^&#x2F;$ are used in the pattern.&quot; That&#x27;s <i>your</i> phrasing, not anyone else&#x27;s. That&#x27;s <i>your</i> story, not theirs.<p>I still have not seen anything from you that makes sense of the behavior that `cat$` does not match `cat\\n\\n`. Like, I realize you&#x27;ve tried to explain it. But your explanation does not make sense. That&#x27;s because the behavior is <i>strange</i>.<p>The only actual way to explain the behavior of $ is what the `re` docs say: it either matches at the end of the string or just before a `\\n` that appears at the end of the string. That&#x27;s it.\n\n                                You are right, it is my wording, I replaced end of string or before newline as the last character with end of line because that is what this means. You could also write that into the documentation but then you would have to also explain what end of line means. And I will grant you that I might be wrong, that the behavior is only accidentally identical to matching the end of a line but that the true reason for it is different.<p>cat$, the $ matches the end of the line, the second \\n, cat is not directly before that. I guess you want the regex engine to first treat the input as a multi-line input, extract cat\\n as the first line, and then have cat$ match successfully in that single line? What about cat$ and dog$ and cat\\ndog\\n.\n\n                                  &gt; I guess you want the regex engine<p>Ignoring compatibility concerns, I would want the regex engine to behave the same way RE2, Go&#x27;s regexp package and Rust&#x27;s regex engine behave. I remember specifically considering Cox&#x27;s decision ~10 years ago when writing the initial implementation of the regex crate. I thought Perl&#x27;s (and Python&#x27;s) behavior on this point was whacky then and I still think it&#x27;s whacky now. So I followed RE2&#x27;s semantics.<p>The OP is right to be surprised by this. And folks will continue to be surprised by it for eternity because it&#x27;s an extremely subtle corner case that doesn&#x27;t have a consistent story explaining its behavior. (I know you have proffered one, but I don&#x27;t find it consistent in the context of a general purpose regex engine that searches arbitrary strings and not just lines.)<p>Of course, compatibility is a trump card here. I&#x27;ve acknowledged that. Changing this behavior now would be too hard. The best you could probably do is some kind of migration, where you provide the more &quot;sensible&quot; behavior behind an opt-in flag. And then maybe Python 4 enables it by default. But it&#x27;s a lot of churn, and while people will continue to be confounded by this so long as the behavior exists, it probably isn&#x27;t a Huge &amp; Common Deal In Practice. So it may not be worth fixing. But if you&#x27;re starting from scratch? Yes, please don&#x27;t implement $ this way. It should match the end of the string when &#x27;m&#x27; is disabled and the end of any line (including end of string and possibly being Unicode aware, depending on how much you care about that) when &#x27;m&#x27; is enabled.\n\n                                  Dunno if you noticed who you are debating with here... :-D\n\n        Given that in unix they sort started as:<p><pre><code>    ed -&gt; sed\n    ed -&gt; grep\n</code></pre>\nThe line oriented mature makes sense.<p>There is some sed multi-line capability if one uses the hold space, but it is much easier to just use awk.\n\n      Not quite, there are standards for this behaviour (formal and de jure).\n\n        And the ones that do not match cat\\n with cat$ arguably have it wrong. Both ^ and $ anchor to the start and end of lines, not to the start and end of strings, whether in multi-line mode or not.\n\n    It&#x27;s not wrong actually. It&#x27;s the difference between BRE and ERE, which are the two different POSIX standards that define regex. In BRE the $ should always match the end of the string (the spec specifically says it should match the string terminator since &quot;newlines aren&#x27;t special characters&quot;), while the ERE spec says it should match until the end of the line.<p>The real issue is that no language nowadays &quot;just&quot; implements BRE or ERE since both specs are lacking in features.<p>Most languages instead implement some variant of Perl&#x27;s regex instead (often called PCRE regex because of the C library that brought Perl&#x27;s regex to C), which as far as I can tell isn&#x27;t standardized, so you get these subtle differences between implementations.\n\n  The article is about when multi-line is <i>disabled</i>.\n\nI&#x27;m confused by this blog-post. In the table: what is the reg-ex pattern tested and against which input?\n\n  The input being matched is &quot;cat\\n&quot; and the regex pattern is one of:<p><pre><code>  &quot;cat$&quot; with multiline enabled\n  &quot;cat$&quot; with multiline disabled\n  &quot;cat\\z&quot;\n  &quot;cat\\Z&quot;</code></pre>\n\nStructural regexes as found in the sam editor are an obscure but well engineered regex engine. I am far from an expert but my main takeaway from them is that most regex engines have an implied structure built around &quot;lines&quot; of text. While you can work around this, it is awkward. Structural regexes allow you to explicitly define the structure of a match, that is, you get to tell the engine what a &quot;line&quot; is.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.cat-v.org&#x2F;plan_9&#x2F;1&#x2F;sam\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.cat-v.org&#x2F;plan_9&#x2F;1&#x2F;sam</a>\n\nRegexp was one of the first things I truly internalized years ago when I was discovering Perl (which still lives in a cozy place in my heart due to a lovely “Camel” book).<p>Today most important bit of information is knowledge that implementations differ and I made a habit of pulling reference sheet for a thing I work with.<p>E.g. Emacs Regexp annoyingly doesn’t have word in form of “\\w” but uses “\\s_-“ (or something no reference sheet on screen) as character class (but Emacs has the best documentation and discoverability - a hill I’m willing to die on)<p>Some utilities require parenthesis escaping and some not. Sometimes this behavior is configurable and sometimes it’s not.<p>I lived through whole confusion, annoyance, denial phase and now I just accept it. Concept is the same everywhere but flavor changes.\n\n  Exactly the same here, re: Perl.<p>My brain thinks in Perl&#x27;s regex language and then I have to translate the inconsistent bits to the language I&#x27;m using. Especially in the shell - I&#x27;m way more likely to just drop a perl into the pipeline instead of trying to remember how sed&#x2F;grep&#x2F;awk (GNU or BSD?) prefer their regex.\n\n    GNU grep supports Perl regexp with -P\n\n      As does git grep!\n\n      Using PCRE2, which doesn&#x27;t behave exactly the same as Perl or PCRE1.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pcre.org&#x2F;current&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;pcre2compat.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pcre.org&#x2F;current&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;pcre2compat.html</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expres...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;70273084&#x2F;regex-differences-between-pcre-and-pcre2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;70273084&#x2F;regex-differenc...</a>\n\n    hah, I&#x27;m the same too, straight to &#x27;perl -lne&#x27;. I believe that was one of Larry Wall&#x27;s goals when creating Perl:<p>&gt; Perl is kind of designed to make awk and sed semi-obsolete.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Perl&#x2F;perl5&#x2F;commit&#x2F;8d063cd8\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Perl&#x2F;perl5&#x2F;commit&#x2F;8d063cd8</a>\n\n  How did you internalize it? Perl looks like cat keyboarding.\n\n    The same way people internalize punching data and instructions into stacks of cards, or internalize advanced mathematical notation. Just because things aren&#x27;t written in plain english words doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be internalized.\n\n      Advanced math is mostly written in plain English, actually!\n\n    For me, Perl hit me at exactly the right time in my development. One or more of the various  O&#x27;Reilly Perl books caught my attention in the bookstore, the foreword and the writing style was unlike anything else I&#x27;d read in programming up to that point, and I read the book and just felt a strong connection to how the language was structured, the design concepts behind it, the power of regex being built in to the language, etc. The syntax favored easy to write programs without unnecessary scaffolding (of course, leading to the jokes of it being write-only - also the jokes I could make about me programming largely in Java today), and the standard functionality plus the library set available felt like magic to me at that point.<p>Learning Perl today would be a very different experience. I don&#x27;t think it would catch me as readily as it did back then. But it doesn&#x27;t matter - it&#x27;s embedded into me at a deep level because I learned it through a strong drive of fascination and infatuation.<p>As for the regex themselves? It&#x27;s powerful and solved a lot of the problems I was trying to solve, was built fundamentally into Perl as a language, so learning it was just an easy iterative process. It didn&#x27;t hurt that the particular period of time when I learned Perl&#x2F;regex the community was really big on &quot;leetcode&quot; style exercises, they just happened to be focused around Perl Golf, being clever in how you wrote solutions to arbitrary problems, and abusive levels of regex to solve problems.  We were all playing and play is a great way to learn.\n\n    Perl has few “sigils” which are basically types: $scalar, @array and %hash. And few syntactically equivalent operators. Also a set of global variables with character shorthands like `$.`. Apart from that it’s a regular language.\n\nDoes anyone consider RegEx to be standardised? Moving to a new context is always a relearning exercise in my experience.\n\n  My understanding is it was standardised for Posix but the variants in popular use have so many variations.<p>I consider sed to be the baseline. If you can do sed you can do anything but it’s seriously limited.\n\n    POSIX specifies two flavours of regular expressions: basic regular expressions (BRE) and extended regular expressions (ERE).  There are subtle differences between the two and ERE supports more features than BRE.  For example, what is written as a\\(bc\\)\\{3\\}d in BRE is written as a(bc){3}d in ERE.  See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799&#x2F;basedefs&#x2F;V1_chap09.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799&#x2F;basedefs&#x2F;V1...</a> for more details.<p>The regular expression engines available in most mainstream languages go well beyond what is specified in POSIX though.  An interesting example is named capturing group in Python, e.g., (?P&lt;token&gt;f[o]+).\n\n      Indeed, and the most common is Perl since it was the source of many of the extensions.\n\n        I would hazard that nowadays it’s Java due to its broad permeation of the application space\n\n          If anything it would be ECMAScript (JavaScript dwarfs Java use) or PCRE (the de-facto contiuation of Perl regular expressions written in C but used in many languages).\n\n            Yes I think you’re right actually. I’m about 10 years off :)\n\n      &gt; what is written as \\(f..\\)\\1 in BRE is written as (f..)\\1 in ERE<p>Oddly, there are no backreferences in POSIX EREs.\n\n        You are right indeed.  Looked at the specification again and indeed there is no back-reference in POSIX ERE.<p>Quoting from &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799.2008edition&#x2F;xrat&#x2F;V4_xbd_chap09.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799.2008edition...</a>&gt;:<p>&gt; It was suggested that, in addition to interval expressions, back-references ( &#x27;\\n&#x27; ) should also be added to EREs. This was rejected by the standard developers as likely to decrease consensus.<p>Updated my comment to present a better example that avoids back-references.  Thanks!\n\n        That’s because POSIX EREs are actual regular expressions thank god.\n\n    No gnu tool can balance brackets, afaics. So you can&#x27;t do everything in sed. And sed is, by design, useless for matching text that spans lines, so good luck picking out paragraphs with it.\n\n      Sorry I meant to write “if you can do it in sed you can do it in anything” thereby implying it is a subset of the more generally available flavours. The issue at hand however is that there isn’t much in the way of standardisation but 95% of sed should work across all of them. Of course you should get more into the specifics of whatever your solution space supports.\n\n      I am pretty sure even pure Awk can do it; or am I mistaken? I thought there was an even more sophisticated example in the Awk book.<p>Edit: oh, you mean via regex engines available in GNU tools; I am dumb.  Hmm... is there no GNU extension with PCRE?\n\n        &quot;Sed&quot; is the name of a specific tool. It is not defined by the GNU tools, but has existed in some form since 1974, well before Perl. GNU sed and POSIX sed both support BRE and EREs, but not PCREs.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s some other implementation of sed that supports PCREs but that would really be an extension of that implementation of sed rather than a property of sed.<p>And maybe there&#x27;s some GNU tool that uses PCREs, but that GNU tool would not be GNU sed, so it would not be a relevant property.<p>Anyway, they probably should have said BREs or EREs rather than &quot;sed&quot;...\n\n        Nope. Gnu regex tools also do not support lookahead or alternation. Lookahead is really useful.<p>It&#x27;s a problem for Linux that it can&#x27;t move on. The cold dead hand of gnu is firmly around the community&#x27;s neck.\n\n          &gt; the cold dead hand …<p><i>Android, Busybox and Muscl</i> have entered the chat\n\n  Languages invented after Perl will generally use some flavor of Perl regex syntax, but there are always some minor differences. The issue of the meaning of `$` and changing it via multi-line mode is usually consistent though.\n\n    I like to think of &quot;whatever browsers do in js&quot; as an updated common baseline. Whatever your regex engine does, describe it as a delta to the js precedent. That thing is just so ubiquitous.<p>I do wonder though what&#x27;s the highest number of different regex syntaxes I&#x27;ve ever encountered (perhaps written?) within a single line: bash, grep and sed are never not in a &quot;hold my beer&quot; mood!\n\n      Reason #2 to use powershell - consistent regex.<p>I&#x27;ve got &quot;hold my beer&quot; commits in .net - I&#x27;ve balanced brackets. I believe that&#x27;s impossible in sed and grep. If I were going to write a json parser in a script, then a) stop me and b) it&#x27;s got to be in powershell.\n\n      That seems like just a web front-end developer’s perspective.\n\n      Isn&#x27;t JavaScripts regex one of the worst modern regex implementations?<p>They seem to improve. Negative lookbehind isn&#x27;t missing anymore [1]. But still lack the handy \\Q and \\E to escape stuff [2].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;3950684\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;3950684</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;6318710\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;6318710</a>\n\n      I’ll go along with that, as long as someone ports pcre to JavaScript and that’s the browser syntax we land on.\n\n      &gt; I do wonder though what&#x27;s the highest number of different regex syntaxes I&#x27;ve ever encountered (perhaps written?) within a single line: bash, grep and sed are never not in a &quot;hold my beer&quot; mood!<p>Your comment is missing a trigger warning, lol. But seriously, this is one of my flags for &quot;this should probably be a script, or an awk or perl one-liner.&quot;\n\n  At some point, I felt like I knew them all. There are probably more regex dialects out there, but I don&#x27;t encounter them and my set of knowledge works most of the time.<p>I feel it&#x27;s like driving a rental car. It behaves slightly different than your own car, some features missing, some other features added, but in general, most of the things are pretty similar.\n\n    What a nice analogy. I’ll borrow it in the future.\n\n  My working assumption has always been to check the docs of your specific regexp parser, and to write some tests (either automated or manually in a REPL) with specific patterns that you are interested in using.\n\n  kind of a trick question; there is POSIX and then there is the app you&#x27;re using and whichever flags are enabled (albeit by default or explicitly defined)\n\n  The three big ones I know of are POSIX, Perl&#x2F;PCRE(aka Perl-Compatible Regular Expression), and Go came along and &lt;strike&gt;added&lt;&#x2F;strike&gt; used re2, which is a bit different from the first too.<p>A lot of systems implemented PCRE, including JavaScript, since Perl extended the POSIX system with many useful extensions.  IIRC, re2 tries to reign in on some of the performance issues and quirks the original systems had, while implementing the whole thing in Go.<p>edit: Did not realize re2 predated go ...\n\n    re2 predates Go and was written in C++.\n\n    Go&#x27;s regex implementation is new in the sense that it&#x27;s not just a binding to the re2 C++ library, but it uses the same non-backtracking algorithm.\n\n    POSIX and PCRE are arguably redundant. They both support backreferences, which puts very significant constraints on their implementations. PCRE is at least functionally a superset of POSIX, whether or not there&#x27;s some quirky thing POSIX supports that PCRE does not.<p>re2 adds a legitimate option to the menu of using NDFAs, which have the disadvantage of not supporting backreferences, but have the advantage of having constrained complexity of scanning a string. This does not come for free; you can conceivably end up with a compiled regexp of very large size with an NDFA approach, but most of the time you won&#x27;t. The result may be generally slower than a PCRE-type approach, but it can also end up safer because you can be confident that there isn&#x27;t a pathological input string for a given regexp that will go exponential.<p>This is one of those cases where ~99% of the time, it doesn&#x27;t really matter which you choose, but at the scale of the Entire Programming World, both options need to be available. I&#x27;ve got some security applications where I legitimately prefer the re2 implementation in Go because it is advantageous to be confident that the REs I write have no pathological cases in the arbitrary input they face. PCRE can be necessary in certain high-performance cases, as long as you can be sure you&#x27;re not going to get that pathological input.<p>RE engines don&#x27;t quite engender the same emotions as programming languages as a whole, but this is not cheerleading, this is a sober engineering assessment. I use both styles in my code. I&#x27;ve even got one unlucky exe I&#x27;ve been working with lately that has both, because it rather irreducibly has the requirements for both. Professionally annoying, but not actually a problem.\n\n      I&#x27;ll add two notes to this:<p>* Finite automata based regex engines don&#x27;t necessarily have to be slower than backtracking engines like PCRE. Go&#x27;s regexp is in practice slower in a lot of cases, but this is more a property of its implementation than its concept. See: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;rebar?tab=readme-ov-file#summary-of-search-time-benchmarks\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;rebar?tab=readme-ov-file#summa...</a> --- Given &quot;sufficient&quot; implementation effort (~several person years of development work), backtrackers and finite automata engines can both perform very well, with one beating the other in some cases but not in others. It depends.<p>* Fun fact is that if you&#x27;re iterating over all matches in a haystack (e.g., Go&#x27;s `FindAll` routines), then you&#x27;re susceptible to O(m * n^2) search time. This applies to all regex engines that implement some kind of leftmost match priority. See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;rebar?tab=readme-ov-file#quadratic\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;rebar?tab=readme-ov-file#quadr...</a> for a more detailed elaboration on this point.\n\n        Excellent, thank you.\n\n      &gt; RE engines don&#x27;t quite engender the same emotions as programming languages as a whole, but this is not cheerleading, this is a sober engineering assessment.<p>Good on you.\n\n        I love when people pat themselves on the back for being pragmatic. Why wait for others to compliment you when you can do it yourself?

Newlines at the end of a string are certainly something that could get lost in transit inside an online service involving multiple runtimes.\n\n  I fail to add carriage return to the test string on that site.

Under POSIX, a newline should always be present at the end of a non-empty text file and is not meaningful; not everyone agrees or is aware.<p>There are plenty of other ways, too; bugs happen.\n\n      Ideally no runtime should alter strings passing through (&quot;in transit&quot;) from one runtime to another - unless it does some processing on them.\n\n  I&#x27;ve now tested C#, directly, and got the same result as the article.

So broken.\n\n  FWIW, and I know this doesn&#x27;t really address your complaint: I use Windows and I&#x27;ve set all my text editors to use LF exclusively years ago and Things Are Great. No more weird Git autocrlf warnings, no quirks when copying files over to&#x2F;from people on Macs or Linuxes, etc. Even Notepad supports LF line endings for quite a long time now - to my practical experience, there&#x27;s little remaining in Windows that makes CRLF &quot;the OS standard line ending&quot;.<p>I bet if someday VS Code&#x27;s Windows build ships with LF default on new installations, people won&#x27;t even notice.<p>I mean, at some point it did matter what the OS did when you pressed the &quot;Enter&quot; button. But this isn&#x27;t really the case much anymore. VS Code catches that keypress, and inserts whatever &quot;files.eol&quot; is set to. Sublime does the same. I didn&#x27;t check, but I assume every other IDE has this setting.<p>Similarly, the HTML spec, which is pretty nuts, makes browsers normalize my enters to LF characters as I type into this textarea here (I can check by reading the `value` property in devtools), but when it&#x27;s submitted, it converts every LF to a CRLF because that&#x27;s how HTML forms were once specced back in the day. Again though, what my OS considers to be &quot;the standard newline&quot; is simply not considered at all. Even CMD.EXE batch files support LF.<p>I don&#x27;t really type newlines all that much outside IDEs and browsers (incl electron apps) and places like MS Word, all of which disregard what the OS does and insert their own thing. Maybe the terminal? I don&#x27;t even know. I doubt it&#x27;s very consequential.<p>EDIT: PSA the same holds for backslashes! Do Not Use Backslashes. Don&#x27;t use &quot;OS specific directory separator constants&quot;. It&#x27;s not 1998, just type &quot;&#x2F;&quot; - it just works.\n\n    I could never get visual studio (not code) to not use \\r\\n when editing a solution file via the gui\n\n    &gt; Even CMD.EXE batch files support LF.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is the case on Windows 11, but I have surely been bitten by CMD batch files using LF line endings. I don&#x27;t remember the exact issue but it may have been the one bug affecting labels.

It doesn&#x27;t even behave properly in most cases. Just use \\n everywhere and bite the lemon for a short while to fix your problems.<p>And if you believe \\r\\n is the way to go, please make sure \\n\\r also works as they should have the same results. (or \\r\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r for that matter)\n\n    There are unices that use LFCR endings... computing is an endless bath in history\n\n    But without \\r how am I supposed to print to my typewriter over serial cable? Only half-joking, that&#x27;s the setup my family had in the early 90&#x27;s.\n\n      Send BELL characters and wait for human intervention\n\n    Why did they even decide to use two characters for the end of line? Seems bizarre.  I could have imagined that `\\r` and `\\n` was a tossup. But why both?\n\n      Likely compatibility bugs going back decades (70s?). Probably with some terminal&#x2F;teletype.<p>\\r - returned teletype head to the start of a line<p>\\n - move paper one line down<p>&gt; The sequence CR+LF was commonly used on many early computer systems that had adopted Teletype machines—typically a Teletype Model 33 ASR—as a console device, because this sequence was required to position those printers at the start of a new line. The separation of newline into two functions concealed the fact that the print head could not return from the far right to the beginning of the next line in time to print the next character. Any character printed after a CR would often print as a smudge in the middle of the page while the print head was still moving the carriage back to the first position. &quot;The solution was to make the newline two characters: CR to move the carriage to column one, and LF to move the paper up.&quot;[2] In fact, it was often necessary to send extra padding characters—extraneous CRs or NULs—which are ignored but give the print head time to move to the left margin. Many early video displays also required multiple character times to scroll the display.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Newline\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Newline</a>\n\n        It’s similar to an old school typewriter.<p>The handle does 2 things: return and feed. You can also just return by not pulling all the way or the other way around depending on the design\n\n          Which also let you do strikethrough and similar effects by typing over a line you already typed\n\n        It is known. Why didn’t Linux decide to do that though.\n\n          Oh well. It’s more important to well-actually your knowledge of typewriter characters than to explain the history of why Windows is apparently <i>the only platform</i> (not Linux, not Mac, probably not the BSDs) that had to take “backwards compatibility” into concern.\n\n      Typewriters is why\n\n        Thank you. I totally didn’t know what “linefeed” and “carriage return” mean.\n\n      Carriage Return (\\r) - move to start of line<p>Line Feed (\\n) - move down 1 line<p>Essentially, when you&#x27;re sending commands to teletypes, that&#x27;s how you&#x27;d have to do it.\n\n        I know what the symbols mean and their original purpose. No one has answered why Windows and apparently only Windows acts like this. It’s not like Windows is the only platform that cares about hysterical raisins.\n\n    \\r\\n is a standard though (in fact, it&#x27;s arguably more of a standard than what Unix and C did), so you really can&#x27;t just do something different and expect everyone to follow.<p>(For example, most text-based internet protocols such as HTTP use \\r\\n as a line separator&#x2F;terminator, so refusing to put the \\r will be incompatible for no reason.)\n\nI can hear thousands of bad hiring manager&#x27;s adding &#x27;How do you match the end of a string in a regex?&#x27; to their list of &#x27;Ha!

Are there any experts here that can assess the quality and correctness of gpt-generated regex?

(For example, the RFC disallows two consecutive dots in the local-part.)\n\n              I take the descriptivist approach to email validation, rather than the prescriptivist.<p>I know an email has to have a domain name after the @ so I know where to send it.<p>I also know it has to have something before the @ so the domain’s email server knows how to handle it.<p>But do I care if the email server is supports sub addresses, characters outside of the commonly supported range (eg quotation marks and spaces), or even characters which aren’t part of the RFC? I do not.<p>If the user gives me that email, I’ll trust them. Worst case they won’t receive the verification email and will need to double check it. But it’s a lot better than those websites who try to tell me my email is invalid because their regex is too picky.\n\n                I generally agree, but the two consecutive dots (or leading&#x2F;trailing dots) are an example that would very likely be a typo and that you wouldn’t particularly want to send. Similar for unbalanced quotes, angle brackets, and other grammar elements.\n\n                  I wonder whether simply (regex) replacing a sequence of .&#x27;s with a single one as part of a post-processing step would be effective.\n\n                    That would be bad form, IMO. The user may have typed <i>john..kennedy@example.com</i> by mistake instead of <i>john.f.kennedy@example.com</i>, and now you’ll be sending their email to <i>john.kennedy@example.com</i>. Similar for leading or trailing dots. You can’t just decide what a user probably meant, when they type in something invalid.\n\n                Yeah, that&#x27;s about as far as I&#x27;ve ever been comfortable going in terms of validating email addresses too: some stuff followed by &quot;@&quot; followed by more stuff.<p>Though I guess adding a check for invalid dot patterns might be worthwhile.\n\n                The HTML email regex validation [1] is probably the best rule to use for validating an email address in most user applications. It prohibits IP address domain literals (which the emailcore people have basically said is of limited utility [2]), and quoted strings in the localpart. Its biggest fault is allowing multiple dots to appear next to each other, which is a lot of faff to put in a regex when you already have to individually spell out every special character in atext.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.spec.whatwg.org&#x2F;multipage&#x2F;input.html#email-state-(type=email)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.spec.whatwg.org&#x2F;multipage&#x2F;input.html#email-stat...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;draft-ietf-emailcore-as&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;draft-ietf-emailcore-as&#x2F;</a>\n\n              What is maybe more important to note, it completely disallows the language of some 4&#x2F;5 of the humanity. And partially disallows some 2&#x2F;3 of the rest.\n\n            Actually pretty good response if the programmer bothers to read all of it<p>I&#x27;d be more emphatic that you shouldn&#x27;t rely on regexes to validate emails and that this should only be used as an &quot;in the form validation&quot; first step to warn of user input error, but the gist is there<p>&gt; This regex is *practical for most applications* (??), striking a balance between complexity and adherence to the standard. It allows for basic validation but does not fully enforce the specifications of RFC 5322, which are much more intricate and challenging to implement in a single regex pattern.<p>^ (&quot;challenging&quot;? Didn&#x27;t I see that emails validation requires at least a grammar and not just a regex?)<p>&gt; For example, it doesn&#x27;t account for quoted strings (which can include spaces) in the local part, nor does it fully validate all possible TLDs. Implementing a regex that fully complies with the RFC specifications is impractical due to their complexity and the flexibility allowed in the specifications.<p>&gt; For applications requiring strict compliance, it&#x27;s often recommended to use a library or built-in function for email validation provided by the programming language or framework you&#x27;re using, as these are more likely to handle the nuances and edge cases correctly. Additionally, the ultimate test of an email address&#x27;s validity is sending a confirmation email to it.\n\n            Not good at all, but a little better than expected. I use + in email addresses prominently and there are so many websites who don&#x27;t even allow that...\n\n            Remember to first punycode the domain part of an email address before trying to validate it, or it will not work with  internationalized domain names.\n\n              Support for IDN email addresses is still patchy at best. Many systems can’t send to them; many email hosts still can’t handle being configured for them.\n\n          Prompt:<p>&#x27;I&#x27;m writing a nodejs javascript application and I need a regex to validate emails in my server.

XY is a problem you don&#x27;t want solved, but instead to be told that you don&#x27;t want to solve it.<p>Maybe some future LLM can also push back. Maybe some future LLM can guide you to the right answer for a problem. But at the current state: nope.<p>Related: regexes are almost never the best answer to any question. They are available and quick, so all considered, maybe &quot;the best&quot; for this case. But overall: nah.\n\n        While I agree with your point that knowing things matters, it is entirely possible with the current batch of LLMs to get to an answer you don&#x27;t know much about.  It&#x27;s actually one of the few things they do reliably well.<p>You start with what you <i>do</i> know, asking leading questions and being clear about what you don&#x27;t, and you build towards deeper and deeper terminology until you get to the point where there are docs to read (because you still can&#x27;t trust them to get the specifics right).<p>I&#x27;ve done this on a number of projects with pretty astonishing results, building stuff that would otherwise be completely out of my wheelhouse.\n\n        Funny for me there have been instances where the LLM did push back. I had a plan of how to solve something and tasked the LLM with a draft implementation. It kept producing another solution which I kept rejecting and specifying more details so it wouldn&#x27;t stray. In the end I had to accept that my solution couldn&#x27;t work, and that the proposed one was acceptable. It&#x27;s going to happen again, because it often comes up with inferior solutions so I&#x27;m not very open to the reverse situation.\n\n          I should have clarified better. Because, indeed, I have the same experience with copilot. Where it suggested code that I disliked but was actually the right one and mine the wrong one.<p>I was talking about X-Y on a higher level though. Architecture, Design Patterns, that kind of stuff. LLMs are (still?) particularly bad at this. Which is rather obvious if you think of them as &quot;just&quot; statistical models: it&#x27;ll just suggest what is done most often in your context, not what is current best for your context.\n\n            Yea I don&#x27;t think the crop of LLM is useful for this. They let themselves be lead by what&#x27;s written, and struggle to understand negation even. So when I suspect there is a better solution, I have a hard time getting such an answer, even if asking explicitly for alternatives. I doubt it&#x27;s just a question of training, they seem to lock themselves on the context. When using Phind, this is somewhat mitigated by mixing in context from the web, which can lead to responses that include alternatives.\n\n      This is something ChatGPT would say.\n\n      Sure, why bother understanding anything if ChatGPT can just produce the answers for you ;). You don&#x27;t have to understand the answers even. Actually you don&#x27;t need to understand the question also. Just forward the question from your manager to ChatGPT and forward the answer back to your manager ;). Why make life difficult for yourself?\n\n&gt; Folks who&#x27;ve worked with regular expressions before might know about ^ meaning &quot;start-of-string&quot; and correspondingly see $ as &quot;end-of-string&quot;.<p>Huh. I always think of them as &quot;start-of-line&quot; and &quot;end-of-line&quot;. I mean, a lot of the time when I&#x27;m working with regexes, I&#x27;m working with text a line at a time so the effect is the same, but that doesn&#x27;t change how I think of those operators.<p>Maybe because a fair amount of the work I do with regexes (and, probably, how I was introduced to them) is via `grep`, so I&#x27;m often thinking of the inputs as &quot;lines&quot; rather than &quot;strings&quot;?\n\n  Same, tho it&#x27;d be interesting to see if this behavior holds if the file ends without a trailing newline and your match is on the final newline-less line.\n\n    Fortunately, it&#x27;s pretty simple to test.<p><pre><code>    $ printf &#x27;Line with EOL\\nLine without EOL&#x27; | grep &#x27;EOL$&#x27;        \n    Line with EOL\n    Line without EOL\n    $ grep --version | head -n1\n    grep (GNU grep) 3.8</code></pre>\n\n      The line does end with the file, so it&#x27;s logically consistent.<p>It&#x27;s not matching the newline character after all.\n\n        Yes exactly, they match the end of a line, not a newline character. Some examples from documentation:<p>man 7 regex: &#x27;$&#x27; (matching the null string at the end of a line)<p>pcre2pattern: The circumflex and dollar metacharacters are zero-width assertions. That is, they test for a particular condition being true without consuming any characters from the subject string. These two metacharacters are concerned with matching the starts and ends of lines.  ... The dollar character is an assertion that is true only if the current matching point is at the end of the subject string, or immediately before a newline at the end of the string (by default), unless PCRE2_NOTEOL is set. Note, however, that it does not actually match the newline. Dollar need not be the last character of the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved, but it should be the last item in any branch in which it appears. Dollar has no special meaning in a character class.\n\n      Thanks! I was AFK and didn&#x27;t have a grep (or a shell) handy on my phone.\n\n  <i>Maybe because a fair amount of the work I do with regexes (and, probably, how I was introduced to them) is via `grep`, so I&#x27;m often thinking of the inputs as &quot;lines&quot; rather than &quot;strings&quot;?</i><p>Vim is what did that for me.\n\n  It&#x27;s kind of driving me nuts that the article says ^ is &quot;start of string&quot; when it&#x27;s actually &quot;start of line&quot;, just like $ is &quot;end of line&quot;.  \\A is apparently &quot;start of string&quot; like \\Z is &quot;end of string&quot;.\n\n    It’s not start of line though, unless the engine is in multiline mode. Here is the documentation for Python’s re for instance:<p>&gt; Matches the start of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline.<p>Or JavaScript:<p>&gt; An input boundary is the start or end of the string; or, if the m flag is set, the start or end of a line.<p>\\A and \\Z are start&#x2F;end of input regardless of mode… when they’re available, that’s not the case of all engines.\n\n      Probably a vulnerability issue. Programmers would leave multiline mode on by mistake, then validate that some string only contain ^[a-Z]*$… only for the string to have an \\n and an SQL injection on the second line.\n\n        &gt; Probably a vulnerability issue.<p>No? It’s a semantics decision.\n\n      It is start and end of line. [1]<p><i>Usually ^ matches only at the beginning of the string, and $ matches only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string. When this flag is specified, ^ matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line within the string, immediately following each newline. Similarly, the $ metacharacter matches either at the end of the string and at the end of each line (immediately preceding each newline).</i><p>In single-line [2] mode, the line starts at the start of the string and ends at the end of the line where the end of the line is either the end of the string if there is no terminating newline or just before the final newline if there is a terminating newline.<p>In multi-line mode a new line starts at the start of the string and after each newline and ends before each newline or at the end of the string if the last line has no terminating newline.<p>The confusion is that people think that they are in string-mode if they are not in multi-line mode but they are not, they are in single-line mode, ^ and $ still use the semantics of lines and a terminating newline, if present, is still not part of the content of the line.<p>With \\n\\n\\n in single-line mode the non-greedy ^(\\n+?)$ will capture only two of the newlines, the third one will be eaten by the $. If you make it greedy ^(\\n+)$ will capture all three newlines. So arguably the implementations that do not match cat\\n with cat$ are the broken ones.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;howto&#x2F;regex.html#more-metacharacters\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;howto&#x2F;regex.html#more-metacharacte...</a><p>[2] I am using single-line to mean not multi-line for convenience even though single-line already has a different meaning.\n\n        &gt; It is start and end of line.<p>You seem to have redefined “line” as “not a line”.<p>&gt; The confusion<p>I’m sure redefining “line” as “nothing like what anyone reasonable would interpret as a line” will help a lot and right clear up the confusion.\n\n          The POSIX definition of a line is a sequence of non-newline characters - possibly zero - followed by a newline. Everything that does not end with a newline is not a [complete] line. So strictly speaking it would even be correct that cat$ does not match cat because there is no terminating newline, it should only match cat\\n. But as lines missing a terminating newline is a thing, it seems reasonable to be less strict.\n\n            &gt; a line is a sequence of non-newline characters<p>Works for me.<p>How do you square that with your assertion that in your invention of &quot;single-line mode&quot; you implicitly define &quot;line&quot; as matching \\n\\n?\n\n              If you are not in multi-line mode, then a single line is expected and consequently there is at most one newline at the end of the string. You can of course pick an input that violates this, run it against a multi-line string with several newlines in it. cat\\n\\n will not match cat$ because there is something between cat and the end of the line, it just happens to be a newline but without any special meaning because it is not the last character and you did not say that the input is multi-line.\n\n            Python violates that definition however, by allowing internal newlines in strings. For example &#x2F;^c[^a]t$&#x2F; matches &quot;c\\nt\\n&quot;, but according to POSIX that&#x27;s not a line.<p>I suspect the real reason for Python&#x27;s behavior starts with the early decision to include the terminating newline in the string returned by IOBase.readline().<p>Python&#x27;s peculiar choice has some minor advantages: you can distinguish between files that do and don&#x27;t end with a terminating newline (the latter are invalid according to POSIX, but common in practice, especially on Windows), and you can reconstruct the original file by simply concatenating the line strings, which is occasionally useful.<p>The downside of this choice is that as a caller you have to deal with strings that may-or-may-not contain a terminating newline character, which is annoying (I often end up calling rstrip() or strip() on every line returned by readline(), just to get rid of the newlines; read().splitlines() is an option too if you don&#x27;t mind reading the entire file into memory upfront).<p>My guess is that Python&#x27;s behavior is just a hack to make re.match() easier to use with readline(), rather than based on any principled belief about what lines are.\n\n              Python&#x27;s behavior is not a hack, it is the common behavior. $ matches at the end of the string or before the last character if that is a newline, which is logically the same as the end of a single line. But as you said, you can have additional newlines inside of the string which is also the common behavior and not specific to python. Personally I think of this as you just assume that the string is a single line and match $ accordingly, either at the end of the string or before a terminating newline, if there are additional newlines, you treat them mostly as normal characters, with the exception of dot not matching newlines unless you set the single-line&#x2F;dot-all flag.\n\n                &gt; Python&#x27;s behavior [..] is the common behavior.<p>The very post we&#x27;re commenting on shows that that&#x27;s not true: PHP, Python, Java and .NET (C#) share one behavior (accept &quot;\\n&quot; as &quot;$&quot;), and ECMAScript (Javascript), Golang, and Rust share another behavior (do not accept &quot;\\n&quot; as $).<p>Let&#x27;s not argue about which is “the most common”; all of these languages are sufficiently common to say that there is no single common behavior.<p>&gt; $ matches at the end of the string or before the last character if that is a newline, which is logically the same as the end of a single line.<p>Yes, that is Python&#x27;s behavior (and PHP&#x27;s, Java&#x27;s, etc.). You&#x27;re just describing it; not motivating why it has to work that way or why it&#x27;s more correct than the obvious alternative of only matching the end of the string.<p>Subjectively, I find it odd that &#x2F;^cat$&#x2F; matches not just the obvious string &quot;cat&quot; but also the string &quot;cat\\n&quot;. And I think historically, it didn&#x27;t. I tried several common tools that predate Python:<p><pre><code>  - awk &#x27;BEGIN { print (&quot;cat\\n&quot; ~ &#x2F;^cat$&#x2F;) }&#x27; prints 0\n  - in GNU ed, &#x2F;^M&#x2F; does not match any lines\n  - in vim, &#x2F;^M&#x2F; does not match any lines\n  - sed -n &#x27;&#x2F;\\n&#x2F;p&#x27; does not print any lines\n  - grep -P &#x27;\\n&#x27; does not match any lines\n  - (I wanted to try `grep -E` too but I don&#x27;t know how to escape a newline)\n  - perl -e &#x27;print (&quot;cat\\n&quot; =~ &#x2F;^cat$&#x2F;)&#x27; prints 1\n</code></pre>\nSo the consensus seems to be that the classic UNIX line-based tools match the regex against the line excluding the newline terminator (which makes sense since it isn&#x27;t part of the content of that line) and therefore $ only needs to match the end of the string.<p>The odd one out is Perl: it seems to have introduced the idea that $ can match a newline at the end of the string, probably for similar reasons as Python. All of this suggests to me that allowing $ to match both &quot;\\n&quot; and &quot;&quot; at the end of the string was a hack designed to make it easier to deal with strings without control characters and string that end with a single newline.\n\n                  &gt; - in vim, &#x2F;^M&#x2F; does not match any lines<p>But &#x2F;\\n&#x2F; does\n\n                    Thanks for the correction! That&#x27;s interesting.\n\n                  <i>So the consensus seems to be that the classic UNIX line-based tools match the regex against the line excluding the newline terminator (which makes sense since it isn&#x27;t part of the content of that line) and therefore $ only needs to match the end of the string.</i><p>If you read a line, you usually remove the newline at the end but you could also keep it as Python does. If you remove the newline, then a line can never contain a newline, the case cat\\n can never occur. If you keep the newline, there will be exactly one newline as the last character and you arguably want cat$ to match cat\\n because that newline is the end of the line but not part of the content. It makes perfect sense that $ matches at the end of the string or before a newline as the last character as it will do the right thing whether or not you strip the newline.<p>If you want cat$ to not match cat\\n, then you are obviously not dealing with lines, you have a string with a newline at the end but you consider this newline part of the content instead of terminating the line. But ^ and $ are made for lines, so they do not work as expected. I also get what people are complaining about, if you are not in multi-line and have a proper line with at most one newline at the end, then it will behave exactly as if you are in multi-line which raises the question why you would have those two modes to begin with. Not multi-line only behaves differently if you have additional newlines or one newline not at the end, that is if you do not have a proper line, so why should $ still behave as if you were dealing with a line?\n\n            I suppose this is why certain config files are strict about ending with a newline, without it, the last line wouldn’t technically be a line?\n\n            I&#x27;m now amused by the idea of a malicious compliance linter telling me &quot;you have an issue at your code, on line NaN&quot;\n\n          The line delimiter is a newline.<p>If you have a file containing `A\\nB\\nC` in a file, the file is three lines long.<p>I guess it could be argued that a file containing `A\\nB\\nC\\n`  has four lines, with the fourth having zero length.<p>That a regex is applying to an in memory string vs a file doesn&#x27;t feel to me like it should have different semantics.<p>Digging into the history a little, it looks like regexes were popularized in text editors and other file oriented tooling. In those contexts I imagine it would be far more common to want to discard or ignore the trailing zero length line than to process it like every other line in a file.\n\n            Technically the “newline” character is actually a line _terminator_. Hence “A\\n” is one line, not two. The “\\n” is always at the end of a line by definition.\n\n              So if you have &quot;A&quot; in a file with no newline, there are no lines in that file?\n\n                Yes, that is a file with zero lines that ends with an &quot;incomplete line&quot;. Processing of such files by standard line-oriented utilities is undefined in the opengroup spec. So, for instance, the effect of &quot;grep&quot;ping such a file is not defined. Heck, even &quot;cat&quot;ting such a file gives non-ideal results, such as colliding with the regular shell prompt. For this reason, a lot of software projects I work on check and correct this condition whenever creating a commit.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799&#x2F;basedefs&#x2F;V1_chap03.html#tag_03_403\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799&#x2F;basedefs&#x2F;V1...</a> (&quot;text file&quot;)\n\n                  &gt; Yes, that is a file with zero lines that ends with an &quot;incomplete line&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a file with zero complete lines. But it has 1 line, that&#x27;s incomplete, right?<p>The file starts empty. Anything in it starts &quot;a line&quot;. So it&#x27;s 1 incomplete line.<p>I hate weird states.\n\n                    No, it is valid for a file to have content but no lines.<p>Semantically many libraries treat that as a line because while \\n&lt;EOF&gt; means &quot;the end of the last line&quot; having just &lt;EOF&gt; adds additional complexity the user has to handle to read the remaining input. But by the book it&#x27;s not &quot;a line&quot;.<p>If I said &quot;ten buckets of water&quot; does that mean ten full buckets? Or does a bucket with a drop in it count as &quot;a bucket of water?&quot; If I asked for ten buckets of water and you brought me nine and one half-full, is that acceptable? What about ten half-full buckets?<p>A line ends in a newline. A file with no newlines in it has no lines.\n\n                      Thats beyond ridiculous.  Most languages when you are reading a line from a file, and it doesn&#x27;t have a \\n terminator, its going to give you that line, not say, oops, this isn&#x27;t a line sorry.\n\n                        That&#x27;s a relatively recent invention compared to tools like `wc` (or your favorite `sh` for that matter). See also: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perldoc.perl.org&#x2F;functions&#x2F;chop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perldoc.perl.org&#x2F;functions&#x2F;chop</a> wherein the norm was &quot;just cut off the last character of the line, it will always be a newline&quot;\n\n                        Most languages but not all. I&#x27;ve even been bit by this recently in cron.<p>Assuming that EOF is identical to \\\\nEOF will end up causing trouble for you one day, because it&#x27;s not actually identical.\n\n                        I don&#x27;t think you can meaningfully generalize to &quot;most languages&quot; here. To give an example, two extremely popular languages are C and Python. Both have a standard library function to read a line from a text stream - fgets() for C, readline() for Python. In both cases, the behavior is to read up to <i>and including</i> the newline character, but also to stop if EOF is encountered before then. Which means that the return value is different for terminated vs unterminated final lines in both languages - in particular, if there&#x27;s no \\n before EOF, the value returned is <i>not a line</i> (as it does not end with a newline), and you have to explicitly write your code to accommodate that.\n\n                      I get this is largely a semantic debate, but find it a little ironic so many programmers seem put off with the idea of a line count that starts at “0”.\n\n                    No, a line is defined as a sequence of characters (bytes?) with a line terminator at the end.<p>Technically as per posix a file as you describe is actually a binary file without any lines. Basically just random binary data that happens to kind of look like a line.\n\n                    It&#x27;s a file with 0 lines and some trailing garbage.\n\n                    Another way to look at it is that concatenating files should sum the line count. Concatenating two empty files produces an empty file, so 0 + 0 = 0. If “incomplete lines” are not counted as lines, then the maths still works out. If they counted as lines, it would end up as 1 + 1 = 1.\n\n                    Pedantically, if it doesn&#x27;t end with a newline, it&#x27;s considered a binary file and not a text file. Binary files don&#x27;t have lines.<p>In practice, most utilities expecting text files will still operate on it.\n\n                      No file has lines.<p>&quot;Lines&quot; are a convention established by (or not) software reading a data stream.\n\n                        Ackshully\n\n                      That&#x27;s a weird way to look at it. Binary files might not have &quot;lines&quot;, but there&#x27;s no reason they couldn&#x27;t include a byte with value 10 (the ASCII value for \\n). Software reading that file wouldn&#x27;t know the difference, right?<p>Also, why couldn&#x27;t you have a text file without any lines?\n\n                        All I&#x27;m addressing is GP&#x27;s comment:<p><pre><code>    It&#x27;s a file with zero complete lines. But it has 1 line, that&#x27;s incomplete, right?\n</code></pre>\nBecause the Unix definition of text file requires the file to end with a newline. &quot;Lines&quot; only exist in the context of text files. If there&#x27;s no terminating newline, it&#x27;s (pedantically) not a text file and so has no lines. Now, in practice, if you open() that file in text mode, it doesn&#x27;t TMK return an error if the terminating newline isn&#x27;t present, but it&#x27;s undefined behaviour.<p>And if you do have a terminating newline, then you have at least one line :).\n\n                    Here&#x27;s another way to think about this:<p>This isn&#x27;t a weird state. It&#x27;s a language problem. An &#x27;incomplete line&#x27; isn&#x27;t a type of line, it&#x27;s an unfortunate name for a thing that is not a line. Just like how the &#x27;wor&#x27; is an incomplete word (the word &#x27;word&#x27;), but &#x27;wor&#x27; is, of course, not a word.<p>Same thing for formalisms like equations in algebra or formulas in propositional logic— we have the phrase &#x27;well-formed formula&#x27;, and we might describe some sequences of terms as &#x27;incomplete formulas&#x27; or perhaps &#x27;ill-formed formulas&#x27;, but those phrases don&#x27;t describe anything that meets the formal system&#x27;s definition of &#x27;formula&#x27; at all— they are not formulas. &#x27;Ill-formed formula&#x27; is not a compositional phrase where &#x27;ill-formed&#x27; describes a feature of a &#x27;formula&#x27;. It&#x27;s a bit of convenient language for what we can intuitively or metaphorically recognize as a formula-ish thing.\n\n                  The opengroup spec says no such thing.\n\n                    3.206 Line<p>A sequence of zero or more non- &lt;newline&gt; characters plus a terminating &lt;newline&gt; character.<p>See also ‘3.403 Text File’ for the definition of a text file. No new line characters, no lines. No lines, not a text file.\n\n                      &gt; No lines, not a text file.<p>That seems like a broken (maybe just bad?) definition&#x2F;specification to me. A blob of JSON in a file isn&#x27;t &quot;text&quot; if there&#x27;s no newline character trailing it?\n\n                        There are other definitions of a text file than the opengroup spec, particularly for specific OS platforms. I’m not sure what convention JSON follows.<p>As a spec it’s fine. It defines a text file in such a way that you can easily write code to process such a file deterministicaly.\n\n                <p><pre><code>    $ echo -n &quot;A&quot; | wc --lines\n    0</code></pre>\n\n                  Yep. since wc(1) apparently strictly adheres to what a newline-terminated text file is. This is why plaintext files should end with a newline. :)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;729692&#x2F;why-should-text-files-end-with-a-newline&#x2F;25322168#25322168\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;729692&#x2F;why-should-text-f...</a>\n\n                Why don&#x27;t you go ask?<p><pre><code>    $ echo -n foo | wc -l\n    0</code></pre>\n\n                  wc just counts newline characters. I&#x27;m not sure why it would be the ultimate authority on anything.\n\n              Suddenly the DOS&#x2F;Windows solution of using \\r\\n instead of just \\n seems to offer some advantages.\n\n                This does precisely nothing to solve the ambiguity issue when a final line lacks a newline. The representation of that newline isn&#x27;t relevant to the problem.\n\n                  It&#x27;s actually slightly worse: Windows defines newline as a delimiter, not a terminator.  So this:<p><pre><code>  foo\\nbar\\n\n</code></pre>\nWould be 2 lines in *nix and 3 lines in windows.\n\n                  The point is that having a sequence of two delimiters to signal the end of the logical line allows you to have single instances of either delimiter included within the text.  This allows visual line breaks to be included within the same line as understood by the regex parser.\n\n                The &quot;Windows way&quot; is the &quot;right way&quot; for a few reasons.<p>This is definitely <i>not</i> one of them.\n\n                  Which are the valid reasons, legacy meanings of those characters aside?\n\n                    I mean, it was what everyone had agreed upon previously. Microsoft was the only party to follow through. For all the guff they get for not following standards, it was the one standard they did.<p>You don&#x27;t have to love a company to acknowledge they did something right.\n\n                Despite the downvotes your comment received, I think you have a good point. There are two uses for a newline, first to signal the end of a line, for example when sending text over a serial connection, and second to separate two lines, for example in a text file.<p>To indicate that a serially received line is complete, the interpretation as a terminator makes perfect sense - abcd\\n is a complete line, abc is a still incomplete line. In a text file the interpretation as a separator might be preferable because that gets rid of the issue of the last line not having a newline - a\\nb\\nc are three lines separated by two newlines, a\\nb\\nc\\n are four lines separated by three newlines and the last line is empty.<p>But then it might also be useful to have a terminator in a text file to be able to detect an incompletely written line. So using two characters, one for each purpose, could solve the problem. \\r means the line is complete, \\n means it follows a next line. abc is an incomplete line, abcd\\r is a complete line and no line follows, abcd\\r\\n is a complete line and a second incomplete line follows which is currently empty. abcd\\r\\n\\r are two complete lines, the second one empty. abcd\\r\\nefg is a complete line followed by an incomplete line. abcd\\r\\nefg\\r are two complete lines. You could even have two incomplete lines abc\\nefg.<p>But I think Windows always uses \\r\\n because this is how you get to a newline on a typewriter or really old printer, you return the carriage and feed the paper one line. I do not think that they had the idea of differentiating between terminator and separator, otherwise you could have only \\r and maybe even only \\n sometimes. But in principle this could work quite nicely, I guess. You could start a line with \\n and end it with \\r, this would give you \\r\\n between lines and \\r after the final line. Or nothing if the final line is incomplete or \\r\\n if the final line is incomplete and currently empty. The odd thing would be a newline as the very first character, maybe one could suppress that. This would also be compatible with Windows and <i>nix, it would just consider all </i>nix lines incomplete. Only abc\\rdef\\r would not really make sense, two complete lines but the second one is not a new line.<p>If I ever get to write a new operating system, I will inflict this on humanity.\n\n              Technically, that is one of two possible interpretations, and you seem to have invented a &quot;by definition&quot; out of thin air.<p>Very very technically a &quot;newline&quot; character indicates the start of a new line, which is why it is not called the &quot;end-of-line&quot; character.\n\n                I mean, the person you are responding to didn&#x27;t invent the definition out of thin air... the POSIX standard did:<p>3.206 Line\nA sequence of zero or more non- &lt;newline&gt; characters plus a terminating &lt;newline&gt; character.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799.2018edition&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799.2018edition...</a>\n\n                  Posix getline() includes EOF as a line terminator:<p><pre><code>    getline() reads an entire line from stream, storing the address\n       of the buffer containing the text into *lineptr.  The buffer is\n       null-terminated and includes the newline character, if one was\n       found.\n    ...\n    ... a delimiter character is not added if one was\n       not present in the input before end of file was reached.\n</code></pre>\nEOF seems same as end-of-string.\n\n                    Your quoted documentation says otherwise. It says that a &#x27;line&#x27; include the delimiter, &#x27;\\n&#x27;, in the line buffer. It also says that is no delimiter is found before the EOF is reached that the line buffer will not include the delimiter. That means the line buffer can clearly indicate an <i>incomplete line</i> by the absence of the delimiter. To be clear, EOF isn&#x27;t a &#x27;line terminator&#x27;, it&#x27;s the end of the data stream.\n\n                      Yes, &quot;EOF seems same as end-of-string.&quot;\n\n                        No, getline() will stop reading at the newline, even if more (non-NUL) characters follow. EOF is end-of-file.\n\n                  I don&#x27;t know why no-one here sees this as a bad design...<p>If a line is missing a newline then we just disregard it?!<p>A way better way to deal with newline is it&#x27;s a separator like comma. And like in modern languages  we allow a final separator, but ignore it so that is easier for tools to generate files.<p>Now all combinations of characters, including newline characters, has an interpretation without dropping anything.\n\n                    I also always preferred the interpretation of a newline as a separator instead of as a terminator for files because I never liked the final newline causing a new empty line in the editor and as you thought that it was bad design that you can have a somewhat invalid file.<p>But if you look beyond files, the interpretation as a terminator also makes perfect sense, when you receive text over a serial connection it signals that the line is complete which does not necessarily imply that another line will follow. The same in a file, if the terminating newline is missing, you can deduce that an incomplete write occurred and some data might be missing. If you decide to have a newline as a separator after the last line but to ignore it, then you can not represent an empty last line.<p>I guess you would need two different characters, one terminator and one separator. You could start a line with \\n and end it with \\r. The \\n separates the line from the one before, then \\r terminates the line and marks it as complete. You would get \\r\\n between lines as on Windows and the last line would only have \\r if complete or would otherwise count as incomplete. Then again you could almost get the same thing with \\n only, you would just have to change the interpretation, instead of \\n giving you a line and no \\n giving you not a line, you would have to say that \\n gives you a complete line and no \\n gives you an incomplete line. With that you could however not have an incomplete empty line.\n\n                      This effort of building in redundancy is pointless. We just need a newline to know where to start the output on a new line. If you want to safeguard the proper content of a file, a whole lot more is needed.\n\n                  How about a null-byte then? That&#x27;s not a newline character, but all POSIX tools will treat it as EOF.\n\n                  So this is what  &quot;3.403 Text File&quot; says:<p>A file that contains characters organized into zero or more lines [so characters with no newlines are OK]<p>No NUL, and lines (delimited by and including newline) not exceeding LINE_MAX bytes.\n\n                It doesn&#x27;t indicate the start of a new line, or files would <i>start</i> with it. Files <i>end</i> with it, which is why it is a line terminator. And it is by definition: by the standard, by the way cat and&#x2F;or your shell and&#x2F;or your terminal work together, and by the way standard utilities like `wc` treat the file.\n\n              “A\\n” is two lines.\n\n                Factually incorrect.\n\n      Matches the EMPTY STRING at the beginning of the line is the correct definition.\n\n    That gives the author space for another article ;)\n\n    What is driving me nuts is that we have Unicode now, so there is no need to use common characters like $ or ^ to denote special regex state transitions.\n\n      the idea of changing a decades old convention to instead use, as I assume you are implying, some character that requires special entry, is beyond silly.\n\n        I don&#x27;t think anyone that writes regex would feel specially challenged by using the Alt+ | Ctrl+Shift+u key combos for unicode entry. Having to escape less things in a pattern would be nice.\n\n          Also, code is read more often than it is written.\n\n            People say this all the time, but is it really always true? I have a ton of code that I wrote, that just works, and I never really look at it again, at least not with the level of inspection that requires parsing the regex in my head.\n\n              Even for code I wrote once and then never have to fix, I end up reading it multiple times while I create it and the lines around it.  I think it really is <i>always</i> true.\n\n          I write regexes all the time, and I don&#x27;t know if I would be CHALLENGED by that, but it would be annoying. Escaping things is trivial, and since you do it all the time it is not anything extra to learn. Having to remember bespoke keystrokes for each character is a lot more to learn.\n\n            ASCII restriction begets ASCII toothpick soup. Either lift that restriction or use balanced delimiters for strings in ASCII like backtick and single quote.<p>(“But backtick is annoying to type” said the Europeans.)\n\n            Regexes are one case where I think it&#x27;s already extremely unbalanced wrt being easy to write but hard to read. Using stuff like special Unicode chars for this would make them harder to write but easier to read, which sounds like a fair deal to me. In general, I&#x27;d say that regexes <i>should</i> take time and effort to write, just because it&#x27;s oh-so-easy to write something that kinda sorta works but has massive footguns.<p>I would also imagine that, if this became the norm, IDEs would quickly standardize around common notation - probably actually based on existing regex symbols and escapes - to quickly input that, similar to TeX-like notation for inputting math. So if you&#x27;re inside a regex literal, you&#x27;d type, say, \\A, and the editor itself would automatically replace it with the Unicode sigil for beginning-of-string.\n\n              Regexes originate from Perl, or they were popularized by Perl if i got this right. In Perl readable code is not ranked as one of it&#x27;s top 100 priorities. Regexes could originate from J and situation could be even worse though!\n\n                Regex&#x27;s predate perl quite substantially. Think grep and friends if nothing else.<p>Certainly making the perlre library available separate to perl encouraged its widespread use, and lots of others copied or were inspired by it.<p>&quot;Popularized&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like quite the right word though, I don&#x27;t disagree with the point, but if I shout &quot;Hey everyone let&#x27;s write regex&#x27;s&quot; at the office people throw stationary at me, which is not true of other popular things!\n\n                  Perl <i>spread</i> regexes.\n\n                    Super spreader event we&#x27;ve got ourselves into.<p>I took a look at Raku, which claims be a better Perl maybe, or closely related but more modern, it certainly looks nice. Although i am a big fan of typed languages, Raku piqued my interest.\n\n                      In Raku, if you want to go typed, you can!  It&#x27;s called &quot;gradually typed&quot;.<p>my Int $a = 42;     # ok<p>my Int $a = &quot;foo&quot;;  # Type check failed in assignment to $a; expected Int but got Str (&quot;foo&quot;)\n\n                        Very nice, good to know. Yes i know gradual typing, Python has a form of that i think. I will check out Raku at some point, the type system will not go unnoticed. I didn&#x27;t even know it had one!\n\n        It’s not that silly. You constantly get into escape conundrums because you need to use a metacharacter which is also a metacharacter three levels deep in some embedding.<p>(But that might not solve that problem? Maybe the problem is mostly about using same-character delimiters for strings.)<p>And I guess that’s why Perl is so flexible with regards to delimiters and such.\n\n          Yes, languages really need some sort of &quot;raw string&quot; feature like Python (or make regex literals their own syntax like Perl does). That&#x27;s the solution here, not using weird characters...\n\n            Fine enough. But I wonder why strings have to use the same delimiter. Imagine if you had a list delimiter `|` and the answer to nested lists was “ohh, use raw list syntax, just make `###||` when you are three levels deep or something”.\n\n              On the third hand strings are of course a special case because you always have special characters and whatnot which makes raw strings useful. :) Not just doing `&quot;` and stuff.\n\n              It is quite nice what `sed` does. A sed search-and-replace is typically shown as `s&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;`, but you can actually use any punctuation character to separate the parts. Whatever follows the &quot;s&quot; will be used for that statement, so you can write `s|foo|bar|` or `s:foo:bar:`, even mixing and matching in the same script to have `s|baz|quux|; s:xyzzy:blorp:` and it will all work.\n\n            The weird characters are part of the syntax here. Of course, you can make it more verbose, or more flexible&#x2F;configurable.\n\n      Why not? Common characters are easier to type and presumbly if you are using regex on a unicode string they might include these special characters anyway so what have you gained?\n\n        In theory yes, in practice no.<p>What you have gained is that the regex is now much easier to read.\n\n          It&#x27;s easy to read now.\n\n          &gt; In theory yes, in practice no.<p>That&#x27;s like &quot;in theory we need 4 bytes to represent Unicode, but in practice 3 bytes is fine&quot; (<i>glances at universally-maligned utf8mb3</i>)\n\n            It&#x27;s not really an issue if the string you&#x27;re matching might have those characters. It&#x27;s an issue if the <i>regex</i> you are matching that string might need to <i>match</i> those characters verbatim. Which is actually pretty common with ()[]$ when you&#x27;re matching phone numbers, prices etc - so you end up having to escape a lot, and regex is less readable especially if it also has to use those same characters as regex operators. On the other hand, it would be very uncommon to want to literally match, say, ⦑⦒ or ⟦⟧.\n\n      If we were willing to ignore the ability to actually type it, you don&#x27;t need Unicode for that; ASCII has a whole block of control characters at the beginning; I think ASCII 25 (&quot;End of medium&quot;) works here.\n\n      The problem with using an eggplant to denote end of\nstring is backwards compatibility.\n\n    What with unicode, it&#x27;d be fun to have Α and Ω available to make our regexps that much more readable...\n\n  I&#x27;m the same, but now that I try in Perl, sure enough, $ seems to default to being a positive lookahead assertion for the end of the string. It does not match and consume an EOL character.<p>Only in multiline mode does it match EOL characters, but it does still not appear to consume them. In fact, I cannot construct a regex that captures the last character of one line, then consumes the newline, and then captures the first character of the next line, while using $. The capture group simply ends at $.\n\n    To get the newline captured as well you need to add the `&#x2F;s` modifier too\n\n  I’ve always thought that as well; mostly due to Vim though.<p>^ - takes you to start of line\n$ - takes you to end of line\n\n    ^ actually takes you to the first non-whitespace character in the line in vim. For start of line you want 0\n\n      I don&#x27;t have (n)vi(m) open right now but I think this only applies to prepending spaces. For prepending tabs, 0 will take you to the first non-tab character as well.\n\n        Vim takes me to the first character in the line (the first tab), but displays the cursor on the last gridsquare the tab&#x27;s width covers.\n\n          If you have &quot;set list&quot; to make non-space whitespace visible, it&#x27;ll go to the leftmost position.  I did it long ago along with &quot;set listchars=trail:.,tab:&gt;-&quot; so I can see not only where tabs are, but also their size&#x2F;alignment without causing the text to shift.\n\n  This must be the &quot;second problem&quot; everyone talks about with regular expressions.\n\n  Same here; when I saw the title I was like &quot;well obviously not, where did you hear that?&quot;<p>In nearly two decades of using regex I think this might be the first time I&#x27;ve heard of $ being end of string. It&#x27;s always been end of line for me.\n\n    You couldn’t write a post like this if you didn’t start with a strawman.\n\n      It’s not a straw man, it’s accurate in many contexts.\n\n    Take a look at, for example, these stackoverflow answers about a regex to validate and e-mail address: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;8829363\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;8829363</a><p>These people are I think not intending to say a newline character is permitted at the end of an e-mail address.<p>(Of course people using &#x27;grep&#x27; would have different expectations for obvious reasons)\n\n      Even disregarding whether or not end-of-string is also an end-of-line or not (see all the other comments below), $ doesn&#x27;t match the newline, similar to zero-width matches like \\b, so the newline wouldn&#x27;t be included in the matched text either way.<p>I think this series of comments might be clearest:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39764385\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39764385</a>\n\n        Problem is, plenty of software doesn&#x27;t actually look at the match but rather just validates that there <i>was</i> a match (and then continues to use the input to that match).\n\n  i feel like this perspective will be split between folks who use regex in code with strings and more sysadmin folks who are used to consuming lines from files in scripts and at the cli.<p>but yeah seems like a real misunderstanding from “start&#x2F;end of string” people\n\n  In `sed` it&#x27;s end of string.<p>String is usually end of line, but not if you use stuff like `N`, to manipulate multi-line strings\n\nFun fact: in Postgres, &#x27;cat\\n&#x27; matches &#x27;cat$&#x27; when the so called &quot;weird&quot; newline matching is enabled :)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;functions-matching.html#POSIX-EMBEDDED-OPTIONS-TABLE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;functions-matching.h...</a>\n\nThere are many differences between implementations of regex. To name a few. Lookbehind, atomic groups, named capturing groups, recursion, timeouts and my favorite interop problem, unicode.\n\n<i>By default, &#x27;$&#x27; only matches at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string.</i><p>The rationale was probably &quot;it should be easier to match input strings&quot; and now it&#x27;s harder for everyone.\n\nSeriously, just write one unit test for your regex.\n\n  Indeed, one should test any regex one puts any trust in, but the problem is that if you take as a fact something that is actually a false assumption (as the author did here), your test may well fail to find errors which may cause faults when the regex is put to use.<p>This, in a nutshell, is the sort of problem which renders fallacious the notion that you can unit-test your way to correct software.\n\nThis seems like the perfect opportunity to introduce those unfamiliar to Robert Elder.

It randomly shuffles the line noise we learned over decades.<p>It seems so obvious that&#x27;s the opposite of what they should have defaulted to, that it clearly should have been ^ and $ for lines, and ^^ and $$ for the string, since like ((1)(2)(3)):<p>^^line1$\\n^line2$\\n^line3$\\n$<p>[1]: That, and it&#x27;s not anywhere, while Perl 5 is everywhere.\n\n  Think I would have picked exactly the reverse (i.e. ^^ being more &quot;starty&quot; than &quot;^&quot;).\n\n    Reminds me of verbosity flags in some cli utilities. Often, -v is &quot;verbose&quot; and -vv is &quot;very verbose&quot; and -vvv... etc.\n\n  Pretty much all the regexen I have written have been predicated on start &#x2F; end of string (i typically feed lines through the regex) … so picking single ^ and $ for the whole string maintains a degree of backward compatibility (assuming that I am normal)\n\n&gt; So if you&#x27;re trying to match a string without a newline at the end, you can&#x27;t only use $ in Python! My expectation was having multiline mode disabled wouldn&#x27;t have had this newline-matching behavior, but that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>A reproducible example would be nice. I don’t understand what it is he cannot do. `re.search(&#x27;$&#x27;, &#x27;no new lines&#x27;)` returns a match.\n\n  This unexpectedly matches:<p>re.match(&#x27;^bob$&#x27;, &#x27;bob\\n&#x27;)<p>I didn&#x27;t want the trailing newline to be included.\n\n    But that string does have a new line at the end.\n\n      re.match(&#x27;^bob$&#x27;, &#x27;bob&#x27;) → yes<p>re.match(&#x27;^bob$&#x27;, &#x27;bobs&#x27;) → no<p>Most people would expect &#x27;bob\\n&#x27; <i>not</i> to match, because I used &#x27;$&#x27; and it has an extra character at the end, just like &#x27;bobs&#x27;. In Python it does match because &#x27;\\n&#x27; is a special case.\n\n        ... for some arbitrary definition of &quot;most people&quot;.\n\n          That’s true, probably fewer than ten million people in the world would have an opinion one way or the other. :)\n\nPeople are confused about strings and lines. A string is a sequence of characters, a line can be two different things. If you consider the newline a line terminator, then a line is a sequence of non-newline characters - possibly zero - plus a newline. If there is no new-line at the end, then it is not a [complete] line. That is what POSIX uses. If you consider the newline a line separator, then a line is a sequence of non-newline characters - possibly zero. In either case, the content of the line ends before the newline, either because the newline terminates the line or because it separates the line from the next. [1]<p>The semantics of ^ and $ is based on lines - whether single-line or multi-line mode. For string based semantics - which you could also think of as entire file if you are dealing with files - use \\A and \\Z or their equivalents.<p>[1] Both interpretations have their merits. If you transmit text over a serial connection, it is useful to have a newline as line terminator so that you know when you received a complete line. If you put text into text files, it might arguably be easier to look at a newline as a line separator because then you can not have a invalid last line. On the other hand having line terminators in text files allows you to detect incompletely written lines.\n\nperlre Metacharacters documentation states:\n$ Match the end of the string (or before newline at the end of the string; or before any newline if &#x2F;m is used)<p>(&#x2F;m enables multiline mode)\n\nIs this a bug?\n\nInteresting\n\nWhy isn’t Perl anywhere on that chart when mentioning regex?\n\n  Because they&#x27;re using regex101 to easily test the semantics of different regex engines and Perl isn&#x27;t available on regex101. PCRE is though, which is a decent approximation. And indeed, Perl and PCRE behave the same for this particular case.\n\n    Why isn’t Perl available on regex101 when its all about regex?\n\n      I dunno. Maybe because nobody has contributed it? Maybe because Perl isn&#x27;t as widely used as it once was? Maybe because it&#x27;s hard to compile Perl to WASM? Maybe some other reason?\n\nSeems odd to leave Perl off the list, given it&#x27;s regex related.<p>Here&#x27;s the explanation for $ in the perlre docs:<p><pre><code>  $   Match the end of the string                 \n      (or before newline at the end of the      \n      string; or before any newline if &#x2F;m is     \n      used)</code></pre>\n\n  Yeah, omitting what is arguably the language most associated with regexes seems a bit of an oversight. I guess it shows how far off the radar Perl currently is.\n\n    Perl perfected the simplicity and flexibility of regex syntax from POSIX and it seems every other language after has just made it harder.\n\n    PHP uses PCRE, so it more or less serves as a stand-in for Perl in this case.\n\n      Sort of, though PCRE is not a 100% replacement for regex in Perl proper; the former lacks some features of the latter.\n\n    &gt; I guess it shows how far off the radar Perl currently is.<p>This is a serious misconception. Perl is far, far from dead. The constant activity of the gargantuan CPAN library more than demonstrates very much the opposite.<p>I would say Perl and its community has done quite well considering it hasn&#x27;t had the same mountain of corporate funds thrust into it like more highlighted have. Mainstream ain&#x27;t everything.\n\n      I don&#x27;t think &quot;off the radar&quot; means dead, but that people aren&#x27;t generally aware of what&#x27;s going on with it. I think this is actually pretty consistent with what you&#x27;re saying; stuff is going on with it, but it&#x27;s not on people&#x27;s radar, so they don&#x27;t realize it.\n\n        Fair enough point.\n\nThis led to a few serious bugs in Ruby-based apps.

You generally want some sort of Practical Extraction and Reporting Language, the core of which is something like a regular expression, generally able to handle the, well, <i>irregularity</i>.<p>Most recent example (I did this last week) was extracting Apple&#x27;s app store purchases from an OCR of the purchase history available through Apple&#x27;s Music app&#x27;s Account page that lets you see all purchases across all digital offerings, but only as a long scrolling dialog box (reading that dialog&#x27;s contents through accessibility hooks only retrieves the first few pages, unfortunately).<p>Each purchase contains one or more items and each item has one or more vertical lines, and if logos contain text they add arbitrary lines per logo.<p>A good match and sub match multi-line regex folds that mess back into a CSV.  In this case, the regex for this was less than an 80 char line of code and worked in the find replace of Sublime Text which has multiline matching, subgroups, and back references.<p>Another way to do this is something like a state match&#x2F;case machine, but why write a program when you can just write a regular expression?\n\nThe fact that there are so many different peculiarities in different regex systems has always raised the hairs on the back of my neck.  As in when a tool accepts a regex and I have to a trawl the manual to find out exactly what regex is acceptable to it.\n\nI think there&#x27;s a big opportunity to re-write Regex as a SQL-type language. It&#x27;s too bad I don&#x27;t feel like trying.\n\n  I am 99% confident I’ve seen a post on HN about someone creating a much more verbose regex replacement. I have no idea how to find it.<p>Here’s an interesting project for typed regular expressions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12292389\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12292389</a>\n\nYou can also use (?m) to enable multiline processing on PCRE-compatible regexp engines.\n\nCmd-F perl<p><i>no matches</i>\n\nThe table in the article makes this look complicated, but it really isn&#x27;t. All the cases in the article can be grouped into two families:<p>- The JS&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Rust family, which treats $ like \\z and does not support \\Z at all<p>- The Java, .NET, PHP, Python family, which treats $ like \\Z and may or may not (Python) support \\z.<p>\\Z does away with \\n before the end of the string, while \\z treats \\n as a regular character.\nFor multiline $ the distinction doesn&#x27;t matter, because \\n <i>is</i> the end.<p>Really the only deviation from the rule is Python&#x27;s \\Z, which is indeed weird.\n\nIf you really want to learn regex, you&#x27;ll have a hard time piecing it all together via blog posts.<p>Brad Freidl&#x27;s Mastering Regular Expressions is a good book to read if you want to stop being surprised&#x2F;lost.<p>I&#x27;ll admit I stopped at the dive into DFA&#x2F;NFA engine details.\n\n  Writing a string -&gt; NFA -&gt; DFA grep-like tool is one of my most memorable college projects.

Your query will be searching for `25\\n`, not `25` <i>despite</i> your pre-check that it’s a good value.<p>The second line <i>should always be no</i>, which if you use `\\A\\d+\\z`, it will be.\n\n      Yep, makes sense, thanks!\n\n    <p><pre><code>    $ ruby -e &#x27;x = &quot;25\\n; delete from people&quot; ; if x =~ &#x2F;^\\d+$&#x2F; ; puts &quot;yes&quot; ; else ; puts &quot;no&quot; ; end&#x27;\n    yes</code></pre>\n\n  Practical Gitlab RCE that involved end of line regex in ExifTools:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcraft.io&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;04&#x2F;exiftool-arbitrary-code-execution-cve-2021-22204.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcraft.io&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;04&#x2F;exiftool-arbitrary-code-execu...</a>\n\nPOSIX regexes and Python regexes are different. In general, you need to reference the regex documentation for <i>your implementation</i>, since the syntax is not universal.<p>Per POSIX chapter 9[1]:<p>9.2 … &quot;The use of regular expressions is generally associated with text processing. REs (BREs and EREs) operate on text strings; that is, zero or more characters followed by an end-of-string delimiter (typically NUL). Some utilities employing regular expressions limit the processing to lines; that is, zero or more characters followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.&quot;<p>and 9.3.8 … &quot;A &lt;dollar-sign&gt; ( &#x27;$&#x27; ) shall be an anchor when used as the last character of an entire BRE. The implementation may treat a &lt;dollar-sign&gt; as an anchor when used as the last character of a subexpression. The &lt;dollar-sign&gt; shall anchor the expression (or optionally subexpression) to the end of the string being matched; the &lt;dollar-sign&gt; can be said to match the end-of-string following the last character.&quot;<p>combine to mean that $ may match the end of string OR the end of the line, and it&#x27;s up to the utility (or mode) to define which. Most of the common utilities (grep, sed, awk, Python, etc) treat it as end of line by default, since they operate on lines by default.<p>THERE IS NO SINGLE UNIVERSAL REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX. You cannot reliably read or write regular expressions without knowing which language &amp; options are being used.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799&#x2F;basedefs&#x2F;V1_chap09.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799&#x2F;basedefs&#x2F;V1...</a>\n\nI would hold a code review hostage if any file does not end\nwith an empty new line.<p>My reasoning would be if the file is transmitted and gets truncated\nnobody would know for sure if it does not end a new line.\nBrownie points if this is code end has a comment that the files ends there.<p>The article calls computer languages platforms but the are computer languages. Bash is not included. Weird. I believe the most common use of regular expressions is the use of grep or egrep with bash or some other shell but, who knows. Maybe I am hanging with the wrong crowd.\n\nIn Lua it&#x27;s only the start&#x2F;end of the string<p>&gt; A pattern is a sequence of pattern items. A caret &#x27;^&#x27; at the beginning of a pattern anchors the match at the beginning of the subject string. A &#x27;$&#x27; at the end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string. At other positions, &#x27;^&#x27; and &#x27;$&#x27; have no special meaning and represent themselves.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;5.3&#x2F;manual.html#6.4.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;5.3&#x2F;manual.html#6.4.1</a><p>Lua&#x27;s pattern matching is much simpler than regexes though.<p>&gt; Unlike several other scripting languages, Lua does not use POSIX regular expressions (regexp) for pattern matching. The main reason for this is size: A typical implementation of POSIX regexp takes more than 4,000 lines of code. This is bigger than all Lua standard libraries together. In comparison, the implementation of pattern matching in Lua has less than 500 lines.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;pil&#x2F;20.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;pil&#x2F;20.1.html</a>\n\n  &gt; In Lua it&#x27;s only the start&#x2F;end of the string<p>There&#x27;s an additional caveat: if you use the optional &quot;init&quot; parameter to specify an offset into the string to start matching, the ^ anchor will match <i>at that offset</i>, which may or may not be what you expect.\n\n    That is a good point, and something I&#x27;ve actually (personally) used quite a bit when writing parsers\n\n    &gt; which may or may not be what you expect<p>I find it hard to imagine any other expectation passing the rubber duck test.<p>&quot;Oh, so you expected the match to always fail, no matter what the string was?&quot;\n\n      Well, it&#x27;s not a completely outlandish scenario that the value of `init` might come from a variable that is sometimes at the start of the string and sometimes not, and a newcomer might expect `^` to only match when it is.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s certainly far more useful as it is, I&#x27;m glad it works this way.\n\n$ is the regex’s “the buck stops here” symbol. Here at the end of the line. :)\n\nTotally get the desire, but also feels like last two paragraphs are solvable with<p>```\nre.match(text).extract().rstrip(“\\n”)\n```\n\nOf course it’s line. How could it be the end of the string when the matter at hand is defining the string?\n\nRegex would really benefit from a comprehensive industrial standard.  It&#x27;s such a powerful tool that you have to keep relearning whenever you switch contexts.\n\nWait, in non-multiline mode, it only matches _one_ trailing newline? And not any other whitespace, including \\r or \\r\\n? That is indeed surprising behavior. Why? Why not just make it end of string like the author expected?<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; import re\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc&#x27;))\n    True\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc\\n&#x27;))\n    True\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc\\n\\n&#x27;))\n    False\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc &#x27;))\n    False\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc\\t&#x27;))\n    False\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc\\r&#x27;))\n    False\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(re.search(&#x27;abc$&#x27;, &#x27;abc\\r\\n&#x27;))\n    False</code></pre>\n\n<p><pre><code>  &gt; So if you&#x27;re trying to match a string without a newline at the end, you can&#x27;t \n  only use $ in Python!

Some libraries have modes that change the semantics of ^ and $ but I’ve always found their use to be rather clear. It’s the grouping and look ahead&#x2F;behind modifiers that I’ve always found hard to understand (at times).\n\n  This is a feature that seems so painfully obvious in the abstract that I’d wager most have never read the documentation. I’ve been a regex user since the early 90s and I’ve never thought about this.\n\nThe results did not surprise me. The fact that everyone is in agreement that &quot;cat$&quot; matches &quot;cat&quot; and not &quot;cat\\n&quot; if multiline is off did not surprise me. \\n is implicitly a multiline-contextual character to me. In other words, if you didn&#x27;t have any \\n, you&#x27;d just have an array of lines (without linefeeds), same as if you were reading lines from a file one at a time or splitting a binary on \\n.<p>The other results that differ across engines seem to be because people either don&#x27;t understand regex or because the POSIX description of how to deal with such an input and config was ill-defined.\n\nUgh.

Isn&#x27;t that massively anti-competitive&#x2F;entrenching a monopoly?<p>I would&#x27;ve expected it to be at least disguised as a tax break or something. (&#x27;No tax on US-manufactured chips&#x27; or whatever.)\n\n  Intel has a monopoly?\n\n    Due to the licensing agreements Intel and AMD have a duopoly on all modern x86 chips.\n\n      Who cares? You can buy performant arm64 laptops and servers. HPC is GPUs.\n\n        &gt; You can buy performant arm64 laptops and servers<p>From? Apple doesn&#x27;t count due to the extremely narrow usability of their software and the complexity of using other software on their hardware.\n\n          Moving the goal posts\n\n            Getting caught spewing bullshit.\n\n          It sounds like the Surface Pro 10 will be a good example. Early reviews of the Snapdragon X Elite sound promising. It wouldn&#x27;t take much for others to start making competitive offerings as well.\n\n        Not all software is compatible with arm64.  Specifically I would be worried about attempting to run Windows applications not compiled for arm64, for which there are many.  The compatibility layer Windows ships comes at a significant performance impact.\n\n  A strong percentage of Intel&#x27;s current sales are vendor lockin from the historical &quot;Wintel&quot; age (windows + intel).  This is a moat Apple finally crossed after great effort, and Windows has made a few attempts to cross.<p>If chips were sold purely on hardware specs and not software lockin then Intel would have much fewer sales.  The US giving grants, tax credits, and cheap loans to Intel only serves to extend the lifespan of a company whose compeitive edge is failing.\n\n    Given that their parts have been, up until the past 5 years, clearly better than AMDs (and any other chip manufacturer), and in the last 5 merely competitive, that’s quite the statement. Nevermind that with Gaudi, they also have the only viable AI accelerator besides Nvidia and AMD.\n\n    These grants are for a completely different side of the business. The fab side, and that side is strategically significant for the US government so it makes sense they put some money in. The rest of the world is doing the exact same as well.\n\n  They&#x27;re getting $5.5bn in tax breaks, and loans for $11bn on generous terms too. Their total support package from the CHIPS money is $25bn. Intel are putting in $75bn, taking the total project to $100bn.\n\n  Absolutely. This is why Intel is basically nationalized and no different than an American Huawei.\n\nSo when can we expect 8.5 billion in stock buybacks?\n\n  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20220812015804&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semianalysis.com&#x2F;intel-cuts-fab-buildout-by-4b-to-pay-billions-in-dividends-first-net-loss-in-over-30-years-cutting-fab-buildouts-but-committed-to-growing-the-dividend&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20220812015804&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semianaly...</a>\n\n  November 6, 2024.\n\n    Help me understand.\n\n      After the next general election.

Intel needs a reason to build in the U.S., and grants tip the ROI scale on their side to make it happen.\n\n    IMO this is a big enough national security threat that what intel is doing is similar to if Lockheed said “we’re going to start selling to Russia instead of the US unless the US gives us nice grants”.<p>It shouldn’t even be an option for Intel to continue manufacturing in other countries. It should be “move manufacturing back to the US or the Fed will take ownership of the whole company and do it for you.”<p>(And maybe it’s sort of an unspoken assumption that if they don’t take this carrot, then the US really would use the stick to force their manufacturing back into the US).\n\n      An expropriation of this kind and magnitude by the US government would be historic. Has it happened before? I&#x27;m curious.<p>I know there&#x27;s talk about TikTok either selling to a USA owner or leaving, which seems pretty monumental too. Not quite an expropriation since the state wouldn&#x27;t be taking control of it, but somewhat similar.\n\n    &gt; Intel needs a reason to build in the U.S.<p>I mean, if Intel is only motivated to build in the USA when it gets a fat check rather than out of conviction, I think that&#x27;s a problem too, no? Does this mean that whenever maximizing (short-term) shareholder value is at odds with national sovereignty the USA will have to hand them out a check?<p>I don&#x27;t know that this is what&#x27;s going on here, perhaps Intel really is committed to the USA beyond the individual gain of its executives and shareholders. It&#x27;s worth noting though, there&#x27;s some prominent examples in US history where this hasn&#x27;t been the case. Banks for example got really rich at the USA&#x27;s expense in the years leading to 2008.\n\n  It would extremely difficult to make an educated case that having domestic cutting edge semiconductor manufacturing ability is a &quot;waste of money&quot;.\n\n    and yet INTC has been in business for decades, profitable the whole time, producing chips without this grotesque handout of taxpayer monies.<p>They have already used their excess profits - many $10&#x27;s of billions of dollars in recent years, for stock buybacks, but apparently they really, really need this money from taxpayers to stay a going concern.\n\n      This is a thing intel didn’t care about doing. The government wants the fab strategically so is incentivizing them to do it. It has nothing to do with intel’s profitability otherwise.<p>It’s no different from grants to build renewables, farms, housing, munitions, whatever the government wants done in the country.\n\n        I agree with everything you said.<p>However, it is a very indirect way of getting what the government wants, prone to manipulation.<p>The more direct option is to contract and purchase the finished product.<p>The general problem is twofold. First, it can be more financially efficient to spend on incentives then finish product. Second, much of the public do not trust their representatives to perform this analysis and negotiate in good faith.<p>Is a 25 billion Upstream incentive cheap compared to the Chip Price premium the government would have to pay to have the same incentive?<p>The other question is who benefits from domestic chips and if the government is the right person to pay.\n\n  If you&#x27;re this worried about tens of billions of dollars going to Intel, I have some news for you about the military industrial complex.\n\n    I guess in your mind it is not possible for both things to be bad? As long as we have the bogeyman of the DOD budget, any money spent that is even a penny less than the DOD budget is OK, is that how you see things?\n\n      Well, the DoD budget is 2 orders of magnitude more than this so it&#x27;s about 80 quadrillion pennies less.\n\n        Sorry bad math, it’s only 80 trillion.\n\n  People have been repeating this tired trope for decades and yet we persist. The US doesn&#x27;t even have the worst debt load of developed countries and ones that are significantly worse are still operating fine!\n\n    you mean other than the rampant inflation we are seeing now - and will almost certainly get worse - everything is fine?\n\n      &gt;and will almost certainly get worse<p>If you are so sure go make millions on the stock market and stop complaining!\n\nIn the past 15 years Intel has spent almost $100 billion on stock buybacks. They don&#x27;t need the money.<p>This is a pure transfer of wealth from taxpayers to the rich. And they&#x27;re getting more like $20 billion not once you include loans, etc.<p>The wealthy make massive amounts of money, take it out for themselves, and then complain that they don&#x27;t have capital. That&#x27;s pure junk. And then we wonder why Biden&#x27;s approval ratings are terrible and why we might end up with Trump again.<p>We need to make stock buybacks illegal again. They provide no value to everyone but the ultra wealthy.<p>Edit: Wow, the downvotes are amazing. A company gives away $100 billion then comes hat and in had to taxpayers asking for another $20 billion and we just hand it out. And I&#x27;m getting downvoted?\n\n  I don&#x27;t care if companies buy back stock - but if they can afford to buy back stock, they don&#x27;t need or deserve my tax money to operate.\n\n  &gt; In the past 15 years Intel has spent almost $100 billion on stock buybacks.<p>This is the main reason that I dislike stock buy backs, they reduce R&amp;D investment.<p>If you want to give your investors a prize, pay a dividend. Otherwise, invest in your company!\n\n    Stock-buy backs are basically just dividends with a better tax treatment.\n\n      There is also the benefit to any exec whose compensation is related to a rising stock price, right?\n\n        That depends on the comp structure.<p>Usually comp structures look at multiple metrics that owners want to see. Owners prefer stock price to dividends, so they reward it more.\n\n    Buybacks and dividends are the same thing. Money leaves the company to go to shareholders. Neither is better&#x2F;worse for R&amp;D.\n\n  The new CEO banned buybacks.<p>I never understood the anti-dividend and anti-buyback mindset.<p>I&#x27;ve given quite a bit of money to partially own a business (and I don&#x27;t mean publicly traded shares, but literally buy a portion of a business). I have an agreement with the operator that I&#x27;ll get N% of proceeds (as long as the business can handle that percentage). Are you saying that I, as an owner, am not entitled to it? That&#x27;s rather ridiculous.<p>Imagine a friend coming to you who says &quot;Hey, I need $50K capital to start a business. Let&#x27;s be partners - you provide the capital, and I&#x27;ll do the operations. Oh, and I&#x27;ll give you whatever money I want, whenever I want. Perhaps none at all. It&#x27;ll be entirely up to me.&quot;<p>Would you take that deal? Because that&#x27;s how shares work.<p>Shareholders, on paper, are partial owners. Yet they do not even have an agreement like I do. The company can decide not to share any money <i>at all</i> with shareholders. IMO, <i>all</i> companies that sell shares to the public should be required by law to give a representative amount of money to these owners.<p>BTW, my N above is significantly higher than the percentage almost any company pays back in dividends. Intel used to give about 4.5% return via dividends, and that was triple the industry average. They&#x27;ve since reduced it to 1.5% to be in line with the industry.\n\n    &gt; I never understood the anti-dividend and anti-buyback mindset.<p>I&#x27;ll try to explain it.<p>Companies use stock buybacks to give away massive amounts of capital. Capital that they clearly need for their long term health. Then, because they&#x27;re important to the economy when they have a downturn they come to taxpayers and ask for massive amounts of cash.<p>This is for example what happened to the airlines which then got over $50 billion or so in bailouts. They spent about 80% of that in the previous few years on stock buybacks. They would have been healthy enough to survive without the bailouts. So what happens is companies give their money away to the rich, constantly fail because of that, and take money away from the poor to cover up for their failure.<p>Stock buybacks create a conflict of interest where companies can directly manipulate their stock prices. So instead of building the best enterprise, they can pump money into bringing their stock up artificially.<p>The fact that this overt manipulation of your own stock price is bad was well understood after the Great Depression and that&#x27;s why it was basically banned by the act that set up the SEC in 1934. The SEC then passed Rule 10b-18 granting companies an exception from the market manipulation rules under Reagan.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty clear case of a regulatory agency going against the will of Congress to create basically its own law. It will be interesting to see what happens to Rule 10b-18 if the Supreme Court reverses Chevron in a few months.<p>&gt; The new CEO banned buybacks.<p>Of course. After 20 years of stock buybacks where they gave away the vast majority of their cash the new CEO wants money from the CHIPS act which says they cannot have buybacks for 5 years.<p>It will also be interesting to see if the CHIPS act has any teeth. BAE took the money but is doing buybacks anyway.<p>This is too long of a topic for an HN post. Here&#x27;s a nice and balanced writeup  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3639389\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3639389</a><p>My personal position is far more extreme, there should be a clear ban and the SEC should not be allowed to overturn the law as it was written with a regulation. Certainly if the EPA cannot regulate carbon through the same logic, the SEC should not be allowed to do so.<p>If you want a gentler writeup, this HBR article has it. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;profits-without-prosperity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;profits-without-prosperity</a>\n\n      You start a business and have partners who have bankrolled you. They own a percentage of the company. At some point, you want to buy out their share. But the government just banned it. You can only dilute your share, never increase your ownership stake.<p>Does that make sense? Because that&#x27;s what banning stock buybacks will achieve.<p>&gt; Companies use stock buybacks to give away massive amounts of capital.<p>It&#x27;s one use of stock buybacks, amongst many. Companies also do buybacks to get a greater ownership stake. They also do it if they think their stock is undervalued.<p>Banning buybacks is throwing all good options out to prevent a few bad options. It&#x27;s a kneejerk reaction.<p>My company has done buybacks multiple times. It barely made any impact on the stock price. The much believed notion that it manipulates stock prices ... needs hard data. Look at all the companies who&#x27;ve done it in the last 30+ years - how many of them saw a significant gain in stock price in the short term?<p>I can agree that these transactions need to be <i>regulated</i>. But banned? Nope. For me, though, reform is useless unless they solve the problem I mentioned above: That it is currently legal for me to get an ownership stake in a company and <i>not be entitled to anything in return.</i> Shareholders should have a contractual right to returns that is independent of the stock price.\n\n        &gt; Companies also do buybacks to get a greater ownership stake.<p>Greater ownership stake in what? Companies, at least in the US, can&#x27;t own themselves. Stock buybacks merely reduce outstanding shares effectively increasing the percentage of the company owned remaining shareholders.\n\n          &gt; Companies, at least in the US, can&#x27;t own themselves.<p>These are technicalities: The point was to prevent things like hostile takeovers:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;economics-econometrics-and-finance&#x2F;share-repurchase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;economics-econometrics-...</a>\n\n            Sure, but we get the same thing with dividends.<p>If we eliminated stock buybacks tomorrow, little would be lost other than insiders wouldn&#x27;t be able to use buybacks to unduly enrich themselves and people having to pay some capital gains taxes.\n\n    Buybacks and dividends are not the same thing. Buybacks get preferential tax treatment and are in their entirety manipulative (that&#x27;s why they were banned under SEC rules until Reagan deregulated capital markets) to the market it serves. Dividends are predictable, have a consistent rate across the years and are pretty much impossible to game the market with, as they return value to shareholders over a longer time period, avoiding temporary volatility.\n\n      &gt; Buybacks and dividends are not the same thing. Buybacks get preferential tax treatment and are in their entirety manipulative<p>OK - answer me this. How can a publicly traded company buy more of its own shares (i.e. to get a higher ownership stake)? Or even buy them because they believe they are undervalued?<p>&gt; Dividends are predictable, have a consistent rate across the years<p>Except this is not true. A company decides each quarter how much dividend to pay out. There&#x27;s usually nothing preventing them from saying &quot;Nah, sorry.&quot;<p>We all know plenty of companies that simply don&#x27;t pay dividends, no matter how profitable.\n\n  I think since Pat Gelsinger took over as the CEO, no stock buybacks were made.\n\nPrevious post on the news and apparently the CHIPS funds are not limited to Intel [1].<p>[1] US to inject billions of fab CHIPS cash subsidies to Intel, Samsung and TSMC:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39729979\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39729979</a>\n\nIt&#x27;s unlikely at this stage it&#x27;s possible to bootstrap a company that makes CPUs, GPUs, etc, so it seems to me the US government wants to hedge their bets and keep Intel alive for now. $25B in total is a small price to pay for that.<p>That being said, I would&#x27;ve preferred it&#x27;s not Intel that gets the life-line.\n\n  Intel is the only domestic candidate. Global foundries stepped back from high end semi production about a decade ago, leaving only Intel.<p>And besides Intel, there are only two other companies on Earth; TSMC and Samsung.\n\n    And all rely on ASML, though some of their EUV stuff was in part tech transfer from a US government collab that included  Intel (EUV LLC), and that&#x27;s why we have still have some security veto over selling EUV machines to China.\n\n    The thing is that it’s not leading edge chips that are the most important for most consumer goods like cars and random other products.  It’s the trailing edge chips that companies like TSMC is manufacturing on fully depreciated equipment.<p>While it makes no sense financially for a new company to buy equipment to build trailing edge chips, it’s perfectly logical for TSMC just to keep old fans running\n\n  They could force them to license the production to one to three other companies who kick back a percentage of the profits to Intel. That makes two to four suppliers who receive the $25 billion. Then, we have competing firms.<p>If they think that’s unfair, they can quit asking for our tax dollars to expand their for-profit businesses.\n\n    Nobody needs to force Intel to do this, Intel is already doing it. They manufacture other company&#x27;s designs for hire. Opening up their foundries for use by other companies is part of Intel&#x27;s current business strategy.<p>There are only three companies in the world with cutting edge semiconductor manufacturing capability: Samsung, TSMC and Intel.\n\n      You just argued with yourself. You said there’s only three suppliers, two of which the U.S. wants to avoid. Then, that Intel is controlling and benefiting from how those projects are manufactured. That means the billions would shore up a domestic monopoly that’s in a tiny oligopoly.<p>My proposal would use our tax dollars to create plants that use Intel technology, but aren’t under their control, with different business strategies, operational priorities, and money going to other directors. The supplier diversity would increase competition domestically while strengthening us. While not done the same way, my precedents for increasing suppliers are Intel having to license to AMD and IBM licensing to Freescale.\n\n        Ok, I misunderstood what you meant. I thought you meant license access to the foundry, like TSMC does.<p>What you&#x27;re proposing is that the US stand up a semiconductor fab that can compete with Intel. That&#x27;s going to be hard!<p>I think &quot;use Intel technology&quot; is a lot less practical than it might seem. After all, Intel uses ASML technology, and anyone with enough money can buy the machinery (as long as they&#x27;re not based in China). Intel manufacturing tech is the sum total of all the skill and expertise of Intel&#x27;s employees.\n\nGlad to see so many people pissed off. Nothing will change but it&#x27;s good to see so much information and callouts of corporate welfare.\n\n  Why pissed off? Intel is the one with experience and the US is desperate de-risking TSMC and control more of the chip as chips is one of the most important resources now and in future. Would they give it to Y-combinator startups? If Yes they would be a fraction of it, Intel earned this by being American and being the cornerstone of American Chip business for past few decades\n\n    Yes. I too miss when wintel ruled the day … the music was better too.\n\n      I don&#x27;t think anybody thinks we are going back to that.<p>But right now, CUDA rules the day in AI. It&#x27;d be nice to have a few strong competitors in that space.\n\n    I&#x27;m opposed to it here as I am to it happening in China. Except that I felt Huawei phones were superior to everything else I had used from an OS perspective (They made lots of optimizations). I don&#x27;t Intel as a company in good standing; they&#x27;ve committed personnel, product and corporate fouls. I&#x27;d rather see 20 million go to that kid that made his own CPU. I have faith he&#x27;d do more to better humanity than Intel.\n\n    The US is spinning $1T new public debt every 100 days and there&#x27;s no credible path to return to a sustainable trajectory. Plus, the poster child for federal corporate welfare-- Boeing-- has not done so well with that largesse, Intel is a rather sad candidate to carry that torch forward.[1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;pefco-export-import-bank.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;pefco-export-impo...</a>\n\n      &gt; The US is spinning $1T new public debt every 100 days and there&#x27;s no credible path to return to a sustainable trajectory.<p>How are you calculating this?

There&#x27;s no guarantee that we return to lower rates in the future, but it&#x27;s likely, and that will reduce debt service burden over time.<p>2) Deficits are calculated inclusive of the costs of debt service, but do not include the impact of inflation on the public debt (which is substantial right now).<p>3) Deficits can absolutely be sustainable. The economy (i.e., GDP) grows over the long term, and the tax base grows with it. GDP is around $23.3T, and assuming long-run 3% growth, that would mean deficits of $700B are sustainable.<p>Overall the fiscal picture is not <i>great,</i> but anyone acting like there&#x27;s an acute crisis is probably doing it for political reasons.\n\n        Your link indicates a $1.7T deficit for FY23 which is not &quot;less than $1T&quot;. That&#x27;s roughly twice the figure you offer as &quot; sustainable&quot; ($700B).<p>It&#x27;s been widely reported [1] that the US debt reached $32T in June 2023, $33T in Sept 2023, $34T January 2024, achieving those milestones roughly every 100 days. The projections indicate an exponential increase, which doesn&#x27;t help the case for sustainability.<p>Sovereign debt and fiat ultimately are confidence games.

The <i>debt held by the public</i> is presently around $27T.<p>When actually considering long-run sustainability, you don&#x27;t just consider the real GDP growth rate (as I did above). You really need to consider several factors:<p>1) Deficits<p>2) <i>Nominal</i> GDP (i.e., disregarding inflation)<p>3) Nominal interest rates<p>If you have a ton of inflation, you can effectively reduce the debt burden in terms of a % of GDP, since the GDP grows with inflation and the debt does not.<p>This is the data series that should interest you:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;GFDEGDQ188S\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;GFDEGDQ188S</a><p>You&#x27;ll note an explosive increase due to the extreme pandemic deficit spending (and during the financial crisis), but lately it&#x27;s actually not an &quot;exponential increase&quot;.<p>The bottom line is it&#x27;s not as though these are uncharted heights, or that we&#x27;re presently on an uncontrolled exponential trajectory -- but, we have &quot;run out of room&quot;, and if we have another crisis, we&#x27;re going to be unable to engage in the kind of deficit spending that we have in the past without serious consequences.\n\n            Nice smooth exponential curve, debt held by public as percentage of GDP through 2053.[1] During the GFC, the projections always flattened over the long term. There&#x27;s no longer even a pretense of plans to normalize. We&#x27;ve lived for a long time in the &quot;no serious consequences&quot; regime; this set of projections seems different.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;publication&#x2F;59711\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;publication&#x2F;59711</a>\n\n              This seems to have more to do with population growth projections over the very long run rather than anything that&#x27;s actually going on in Congress right now.<p>Bottom line, our taxes need to go up modestly in the coming decades... but only if these assumptions actually prove to be true:<p>&gt; Inflation slows through 2026 to a rate that is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s long-term goal of 2 percent and then remains at rates that are consistent with that goal from 2026 to 2054.<p>&gt; Interest rates generally rise over the next three decades, largely as a result of projected increases in federal borrowing and in capital income as a share of total income.<p>... I doubt it! Look what happens to interest rates in graying countries like Japan.\n\n    This isn&#x27;t a mandate to accomplish anything. It&#x27;s a pile of cash. Intel will do what it chooses with it and justify it later.\n\n  Yes this is corporate welfare, and sadly it&#x27;s probably necessary. We need to be able and willing to blow the TSMC fabs if China invades Taiwan, and being able to credibly make that threat decreases the chance that they will invade.\n\n    China has their plan up to 2049. I doubt that something that other nations would do change it.\n\nI bet my life that Nancy Pelosi did some trades based on this grant.\nBought way in the money calls or purchased shares...

Or have we already forgotten about that broadband investment from way back?\n\n  The money afaik has to be used for actual manufacturing activities.\n\n    Just wait for the &quot;Coke, Steak, and Strippers&quot; addendum.  The C-levels need that for when they go party with Boeing.<p>Intel made ~55 billion last year.  Maybe they don&#x27;t really need corporate welfare.\n\n      It&#x27;s more of an inducement to get the company to do what they might not do on their own. Intel doesn&#x27;t need the CHIPS act, America does, and America is paying Intel to make it happen.\n\n        This just sounds like how we got into our current mess with Boeing.\n\n          You&#x27;re not wrong, but having an incredibly important dependence on an industry 100 miles off the coast of China (and the target of their increasingly erratic dictator) is worth paying billions to break.\n\n            This short-termism seems like it&#x27;s been America&#x27;s chief problem through the centuries.<p>&quot;We need slavery - our economy will fall apart without it!&quot;<p>&quot;We need Standard Oil and US Steel - splitting them apart would be a catastrophe!&quot;<p>&quot;We need universal healthcare - a public option would place undue burden on insurance companies!&quot;<p>&quot;We need Boeing - our foreign competitors would eat us up otherwise!&quot;<p>At some point, it&#x27;s time to admit that the long-term pain is not worth the short-term benefits we get from naive economic policies.\n\n              1 - not short-termism<p>2 - comparing a minor economic investment ($8B on a $23T gdp) to slavery, and the economic system built on slavery, is the stupidest thing I&#x27;ve read this week, so, well, congrats.  I guess?<p>3 - not a naive economic policy; US government investment built silicon valley and that&#x27;s going ok.\n\n                Try being a green badge at Intel and then get back to me\n\n            Well it&#x27;s a bit like how I see universal healthcare. Would it be worth paying billions for? Oh absolutely. Do I believe the current US Gov could actually take all the money in the world and make it happen in a way I&#x27;d be happy with? LOL.\n\nI feel sorry for any startups looking to innovate in this space. It&#x27;s hard enough competing against established players without them getting billions in free money.<p>Intel has had the resources to build out fabs in the US for decades. Instead, they&#x27;ve chosen to build elsewhere, and now they&#x27;re rewarded for it?<p>They recently announced their $20b facility in Ohio is being &quot;put on hold&quot;:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tweaktown.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;96969&#x2F;intel-delays-launch-of-ohio-fab-plant-from-2025-now-expected-somewhere-in-2027-2028&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tweaktown.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;96969&#x2F;intel-delays-launch-of-...</a><p>While at nearly the same time announcing a $25b facility in Israel:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;tech&#x2F;intel-israel-investment&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;tech&#x2F;intel-israel-investment&#x2F;...</a>\n\n  Israel investment might have gone through due to their research department in the same country. Also, they got a grant from the govt in Israel.\n\n  This isn&#x27;t really a startup kinda business. It costs something like $10b to build a new fab.\n\n    Isn’t that what they said about rockets?\n\n      The big difference there is SpaceX was able to incrementally build up. Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon heavy, Starship. Each step allowed them to prove that it worked and gain investors and government contracts.<p>Who in their right mind would invest $10b just to build the manufacturing capability without having a well established product? And if you have a well established product are you still a startup?\n\n      The equipment to manufacture rockets costs many orders of magnitude less than equipment for a FAB. It also does not get obsolete quickly.\n\n      Musk should have spent 44B on a chip company.\n\n      Rockets turned out to be expensive not because the technology demanded it, but because the companies were intentionally inefficient, e.g. it was actually fine to build a rocket in a tent with simple tools than to setup a massive clean room facility. This was fine because the government would hand them a blank check with a guaranteed profit percentage, and the handful of commercial customers would just swallow the cost.<p>However, it isn&#x27;t as clear if the same applies to semiconductors, since even a bit of dust is indeed a serious problem for producing a chip where the transistors are much smaller than most dust. Until very recently there were no blank checks, every improvement required mostly private investment, so it&#x27;s less likely that the inefficiencies are intentional.\n\n    Any industry wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;really a startup kinda business&quot; if only a few players are pumped more than everyone else combined by orders of magnitude. Having to scale to everyone&#x27;s demand is a lot more costly than if the market was fragmented.\n\n      It&#x27;s not just scale. Even Intel&#x27;s <i>development</i> fabs cost billions to build.<p>The equipment and facilities required for cutting edge fabs are very expensive.\n\n    That&#x27;s where the innovation comes in.\n\n  &gt; <i>Intel has had the resources to build out fabs in the US for decades. Instead, they&#x27;ve chosen to build elsewhere</i><p>Almost all of Intel&#x27;s fabs are in America.\n\n  It&#x27;s called payoffs. Not much we can do when the system is corrupt.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever have a perfect system, unfortunately. Just makes it that much harder for startups.\n\n  <i>I feel sorry for any startups looking to innovate in this space. It&#x27;s hard enough competing against established players without them getting billions in free money.</i><p>Which startups would be harmed by this type of investment? as a relatively casual observer, I didn&#x27;t think there was much in way of startups that were looking to go head-to-head with a company like Intel or AMD in chip fabrication.\n\n  &gt;They recently announced their $20b facility in Ohio is being &quot;put on hold&quot;<p>I have a friend who lives in Ohio who was very excited about this, and I told him not to hold his breathe, its likely they will do everything they can to get subsidies to pay for it, rather than pay for the majority of it out of their own pocket and re-coup some via subsidy, therefore I suspect they will delay opening until they get more subsidies.<p>It looks like I was right, unfortunately\n\n  CHIPS isn&#x27;t a handout; it&#x27;s the only way to get them to build these expensive fabs domestically in a way that makes economic sense.\n\n    As much as I agree, and I really do, this is also a company that mentions they have $7.24 billion available for sock buybacks [1].<p>Sure, maybe they don&#x27;t actually make any buybacks. This is what&#x27;s left from $110.0 billion they approved for stock buybacks in the past, not a quantity that&#x27;s been approved or seemingly needs to be used this year. They haven&#x27;t bought back any stock since 2021 [1].<p>One just wishes they&#x27;d invested in fab-building earlier. They&#x27;ve spent $152.05 billion in buybacks since 1990 [1], a fab apparently costs anywhere from $3-20 billion [2]. That&#x27;s say ~10 potential fabs that instead became just checks for investors.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intc.com&#x2F;stock-info&#x2F;dividends-and-buybacks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intc.com&#x2F;stock-info&#x2F;dividends-and-buybacks</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Semiconductor_fabrication_plant\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Semiconductor_fabrication_plan...</a>\n\n  Imagine announcing you&#x27;re going to build a plant in Israel in the middle of Israel committing a genocide of the Palestinians in Gaza.

They will need updated stickers.\n\nI understand why Intel is getting these, but would be nice to see this money go to companies that are still innovating and are somewhere in the US coalition&#x2F;orbit (TSMC, Samsung, etc.)\n\n  Samsung? Really?\n\n    I mean they&#x27;re a company from a strongly allied nation who operates 13 fabs, why not?\n\n      I guess the implication was that are still innovating unlike Intel\n\n  Samsung?<p>I wonder if this is coming from a position of ignorance... Samsung is among the companies of the world that might be producing negative externalities that weigh more than their positive contributions\n\n    I am totally ignorant, can you explain more about Samsung&#x27;s negative externalities?\n\n    Yeah will fully cop to being ignorant on this, can you expand your comment?\n\n  Samsung is expected to get $6 billion.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2024-03-15&#x2F;samsung-poised-to-win-over-6-billion-for-expanded-us-investment?embedded-checkout=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2024-03-15&#x2F;samsung-p...</a>\n\n  Both TSMC and Samsung are expanding in the USA and are expected to receive significant subsidies as well\n\n  Intel is still innovating though? What&#x27;s with everyone acting like they aren&#x27;t innovating just because they aren&#x27;t the leading performance x86 chip manufacturer? They&#x27;re still shrinking node sizes, they&#x27;ve entered the GPU market, they&#x27;re opening up their fabs to also make chips for other companies...\n\n    Bit hard to claim they are shrinking nodes, when Intel 4 claimed to be in production in 2022, but is still MIA except for low volume laptop products. \nAnd Intel 3 still has yet to appear.\n\n      How can you tell the laptop products are low volume?<p>Meteor Lake appears to be in mass production and shipping in a plethora of laptops worldwide. There doesn&#x27;t appear to have any availability problems.\n\n    I think the general perception is that they&#x27;re playing catch-up rather than meaningfully pushing the limits themselves. Yeah, they moved into the GPU market, but the cutting-edge in GPUs is by NVIDIA. As is the cutting-edge in AI chips. The cutting edge in fabrication is by TSMC. The cutting edge in mobile by Apple.<p>Intel&#x27;s bread and butter has always been x86, but not only is it an ISA that&#x27;s proving non-ideal for a couple new applications (mobile is ARM, AI is in the GPU or NPUs, etc), AMD is really putting up a good fight in that market too, and the crown has been traded a copule times in the past few years.\n\nRight now one of the biggest blockers in on-shoring semiconductor fab at any kind of reasonable price-point and timescale is the lack of a skilled workforce. This legislation has dual objectives: train new people to get into sophisticated manufacturing AND to build out the actual infrastructure itself. That almost guarantees it won&#x27;t be the most efficient way to actually get these chips on American soil. Whether we look back in 20 years and think &quot;wow glad we took that hit upfront&quot; is anyone&#x27;s guess.\n\n  Or we are going to be training Junior engineers with outdated skill sets and build outdated infrastructure.<p>Sometimes top down planning works, but I think I would personally need to trust the leadership and the incentives.<p>Unfortunately incentives on these are typically to do bare-minimum so you can meet the criteria to get subsidies. Sure the chips will be usable, but you spent a multiplier of the cost it takes to get it, and the chips aren&#x27;t cutting edge.<p>I&#x27;d a bit more interested in some moonshot idealism than just some military buildup.\n\n    Top down planning is the only way projects requiring massive capital investment get done.  There&#x27;s no such thing as grassroots fabs.\n\n      The top down planning could be profit driven rather than defense driven.\n\n        Defense consideration generally require defense driven planning.\n\n    It really doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a bit out-dated, you cant create senior engineers without them being junior. All seniors trained on currently &#x27;old&#x27; methods by definition of time passing\n\n    &gt; the chips aren&#x27;t cutting edge.<p>We learned from the pandemic that a huge amount of the world&#x27;s manufacturing economy depends on the availability of old and outdated chips. Being competitive in cutting edge CPUs and GPUs is only one facet of the problem. Incrementally addressing chip production needs seems better than doing nothing for longer in an attempt to solve everything at once, or a riskier leapfrog attempt that&#x27;s likely to fail.\n\n    &gt; and the chips aren&#x27;t cutting edge.<p>Intel is building two 20A in Arizona and one 18A fab in Ohio. If they aren&#x27;t cutting edge, what is?\n\n  Why don&#x27;t we just use AI to do this?<p>&#x2F;s should hopefully be obvious, but it does seem like anytime AI gets mentioned, it&#x27;s clear cut to remove all US jobs away within the next 3-5 years, so it&#x27;s ironic seeing a &quot;lack of a skilled workforce&quot; comment.\n\n  I don&#x27;t think Intel is going to train a new skilled workforce. Their domestic hiring is minimal. Like the rest of tech these bills are leveraging work visas that ensure the Corp has feudal control over their workers.<p>The right thing to do is to block these big waves and force global competition.\n\n    Who would the competition be between?\n\n      Right now the high-end fabrication competition is TMSC, Samsung, and Intel.  All three are supported by nations. The idea that we should just let the freemarket handle the issue doesn&#x27;t feel grounded in practicality.\n\n  The issue is there are few opportunities for junior people to start their careers. There is no shortage of talent but where do we start? I’ve been applying for jobs in the semi conductor industry but haven’t had any luck because ever Is looking for senior staff but nothing for newcomers.\n\n    In most of the west (with few exceptions) is that you should waste at least a decade training yourself with little information of what&#x27;s useful to learn.<p>Then, you&#x27;ll be talked down for being poor and lost. And whatever money you make will be put directly in the hands of your landlords, that profits off scarcity.\n\n      Or be told youre looking for a dei handout\n\n  &gt; Whether we look back in 20 years and think &quot;wow glad we took that hit upfront&quot; is anyone&#x27;s guess<p>Globalization is breaking down quickly. Chips are crucial to national security and our economy. The supply chain for advanced chips is heavily dependent on East Asia which is a geopolitical powder keg and a demographic time bomb. The only thing more expensive than whatever we end up with is chips unavailable at any price because East Asia devolves into a war stricken basket case. We needed to have been starting this panic training&#x2F;building 10 years ago but better late than never!\n\n    &gt;Globalization is breaking down quickly<p>Is it? I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a concrete way of measuring &quot;amount of globalization&quot;, but I&#x27;d guess that right now we&#x27;re probably the most globalized we&#x27;ve ever been. &quot;More things that you use are made outside your own country&quot; has only been growing, and with the advent of full remote companies that also includes much more software than before -- it used to be that only huge corporations would offshore software development, now everybody can do it.\n\n      Global trade as a percentage of global GDP peaked somewhere around 2011 and has been steadily declining.<p>If you look at the US in particular the relative value of imports and exports is down about 30% from the peak 10 years ago. That&#x27;s a big change for such a short duration\n\n        And simultaneously the US has been ploughing massive amounts of capital into domestic manufacturing construction. Money that would have previously been invested into China or elsewhere, is now staying domestic (with a lot of capital also going to eg Mexico).\n\n          What do you mean when you say that the money would have previously been invested into China?<p>Was the US federal government previously funding fab development in China?<p>That is to say, it seams like this investment is to meet a very specific need, and wouldn&#x27;t have happened otherwise. Similarly those paying aren&#x27;t the same either.\n\n        Actually, it peeked in 2008 and I wouldn&#x27;t say 4% over 18 years a steady decline. In fact, it seems to be recovering from Covid to reach a new high. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;global-metrics&#x2F;countries&#x2F;WLD&#x2F;world&#x2F;trade-gdp-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;global-metrics&#x2F;countries&#x2F;WLD&#x2F;wor...</a><p>Edit: Nevermind, it did reach a new record of 63% in 2022.

US continues to withdraw from Naval security commitments from the Bretton Woods era<p>Physical goods are much more complicated to move around the globe than code\n\n        &gt; US continues to withdraw from Naval security commitments from the Bretton Woods era<p>Would you mind listing all the naval security commitments - from the Bretton Woods era - that the US has withdrawn from (eg over the past decade or so, anything relevant to &quot;continues to&quot;)?<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any meaningful reduction in US naval security commitments. If anything the US is as busy as ever with its global naval security efforts. It&#x27;s hyper busy everywhere: from Latin America, to Australia, to Europe, to the Middle East, to Asia.<p>The notion that the US has stepped back at all is entirely unsupported by the actual facts. It&#x27;s just a weak myth being posted endlessly since Trump began spouting isolationism in 2015-2016. Meanwhile, in actuality, the US just spent another hundred billion dollars on a foreign war in two years.\n\n          &gt; The notion that the US has stepped back at all is entirely unsupported by the actual facts.<p>40 years ago the US Navy was equipped and staffed to patrol the global oceans. Now, the US has a relatively few massively powerful forces of naval power projection but is woefully understaffed and under-equipped to maintain the global order against multiplying chaos. This is unlikely to change at all let alone be fast enough to influence outcomes. Growing sentiment after decades of the war on terror is for the US to be hesitant to intervene internationally, and while that isn’t current policy it’s predictive of future policy. It’s not at all clear that it would be popular in the USA to, for instance, go to Moldova’s defense.<p>&gt; the US just spent another hundred billion dollars on a foreign war in two years.<p>The vast majority of this was accountancy fictions about the value of stockpiled obsolete materiel we couldn’t sell but had to pay to maintain or pay to scrap. We have demonstrably <i>not</i> gone all in on supporting Ukraine and Congress is currently strangling any attempt to do so. This is another sign of the US inevitably devolving into an unreliable defense partner.\n\n      I think you would measure it by trade deficits and trade surpluses. That is, now much &quot;stuff&quot; is moving around.\n\n      Ask me in 20 years. There are a lot of worring signs right now that things will get bad, but nobody really knows.<p>When the Soviet Union broke down 30 years ago the US decided the biggest worries were small countries (Iran in particular), and things like 9&#x2F;11 proved they were right.  However Russia is now attacking Ukraine and many think that countries like Poland or Latvia (both in NATO) are next.  China is setting up so that they could take military action to take Taiwan, and other countries in the area.  Nobody knows for sure if either of these predictions will come to pass, but there are signs that should worry you.\n\n    &gt;&gt; Globalization is breaking down quickly.<p>Food. Fuel.<p>Renewables is shifting one of these, but the other will not go backwards, its that or billions will starve.\n\n      Billions are already starving. You just never hear about them. Millions are starving today on American streets. Yet we do nothing but sit on our hands, play hot potato between generations, point fingers, start culture wars, start class wars.<p>It’s all quite boring. Nobody is interested in solving the issue. Only a rat race to see who can con the next person(s).<p>Some days this monologue from Westworld rings true:<p>“ I think humanity is a thin layer of bacteria on a ball of mud hurtling through the void. I think if there was a God, he would’ve given up on us long ago. He gave us a paradise and we used everything up. We dug up every ounce of energy and burned it. We consume and excrete, use and destroy. Then we sit here on a neat little pile of ashes, having squeezed anything of value out of this planet, and we ask ourselves, “Why are we here?” You want to know what I think your purpose is? It’s obvious. You’re here along with the rest of us to speed the entropic death of this planet. To service the chaos. We’re maggots eating a corpse”\n\n        &gt; Millions are starving today on American streets<p>Millions of Americans suffer from &quot;food insecurity&quot; i.e. &quot;reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns at some time during the year.&quot; [1] This is very bad, but, there are also food stamps, soup kitchens, food banks, school lunches, family members, and random good samaritans that prevent actual famine amongst those populations because there is no shortages of food present. This is <i>very distinct</i> from real mass starvation where millions of people are dying of hunger in a famine where there is insufficient food available which is what I believe the GP is referring to.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ers.usda.gov&#x2F;topics&#x2F;food-nutrition-assistance&#x2F;food-security-in-the-u-s&#x2F;key-statistics-graphics&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ers.usda.gov&#x2F;topics&#x2F;food-nutrition-assistance&#x2F;fo...</a>\n\n      The battle is already lost if we can only feed the people Alice today through a global, centralized food industry.<p>Such a system is doomed to fail eventually, there&#x27;s no way around it. Not to mention the fact that its just a big shell game with everyone trying to hide the true external costs of industrial agriculture. The larger we build that system the harder it will fall unfortunately, and if there are no local food producers left in business we&#x27;re all screwed like the Soviets after they realized killing all the people who knew how to farm was a bad idea if you also like to eat.\n\n    Globalization is breaking down because of actions being led by the US. It is not some inevitable process that we have to pre-empt, rather it is actively precipitated by our actions.\n\n      It <i>is</i> US-led, but the US has good reasons.<p>- The US has almost everything it needs in North America to be self-sufficient. Food, energy, natural resources, manufacturing, trade.<p>- The US is tired of being involved in the Middle East.<p>- The US is tired of protecting the oceans and trade for everyone else.<p>- The US is tired of China stealing its tech, being protectionist, becoming an adversary, not being friendly to US companies, meddling in US trade, etc.<p>- The US is tired of NATO not stepping up to the plate. It won&#x27;t back out, of course, but would love for Europe to care more about its own security.<p>There are so many reasons the US is pulling back. Both the Trump and Biden presidencies are completely on board with it. It&#x27;s fully bipartisan, and it&#x27;s going to accelerate.<p>The US is going to near-shore, friend-shore, and to every extent possible, onshore what it needs.\n\n        Good reasons that will raise costs for everyone and lead to measurable impacts on the pace of quality of life improvements. A world that moves towards near-shoring out of security concerns is a world that is long-term poorer. That&#x27;s real medical innovations, improvements in tech, education, climate that will be delayed because of our new cold war. We are already seeing climate impact in the EV car market where we are hamstringing our own policy efforts.<p>Globalization does not necessitate middle east involvement.<p>&gt; - The US is tired of China stealing its tech, being protectionist, becoming an adversary, not being friendly to US companies, meddling in US trade, etc.<p>WTO already has the mechanisms to deal with this, the CHIPS act is hurting out standing with our <i>allies</i> because of its blatantly protectionist provisions.<p>&gt; - The US is tired of NATO not stepping up to the plate. It won&#x27;t back out, of course, but would love for Europe to care more about its own security.<p>Again, not contra globalization.\n\n          &gt; Good reasons that will raise costs for everyone and lead to measurable impacts on the pace of quality of life improvements<p>Do we really need to be stuck on a treadmill of always having to make our lives better? People don&#x27;t know the word &quot;enough,&quot; that&#x27;s a real problem.<p>There&#x27;s obvious issues with how current quality of life is distributed, but I&#x27;d propose that we don&#x27;t need to increase QoL with new inventions simply to make sure that we don&#x27;t ignore those worst off.\n\n            Say that to people with cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy who are getting real, lifesaving treatments now that were simply not available a few years ago.<p>Never mind that the world is not constant - we <i>need</i> innovation on the climate front if we want to stay in a stable environment that doesn’t require more sophisticated adaptation.<p>Making those worst off better without making everyone else poorer would be much faster with globalized trade.<p>I am sorry you have become so skeptical of progress, but I and others will continue working so that a rising tide lifts everyone, including you.\n\n              &gt; Say that to people with cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy who are getting real, lifesaving treatments now that were simply not available a few years ago.<p>Its an unfortunate fact of life that we can&#x27;t build a utopia with no illness or suffering. We have developed many solutions for different medical conditions over my lifetime and I&#x27;m truly happy for those helped. Over the same time, though, we&#x27;ve discovered and named even more. We continue to develop new medications for diseases that didn&#x27;t exist in text books not long ago, and there&#x27;s good reason to believe that pharmaceutical companies invent new disease classifications to get fresh funding for a medication they already have on the shelves.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t help those in need, only that we can&#x27;t run down that path forever with a hope that if we can just solve one more condition we&#x27;ll have it all licked.<p>&gt; Making those worst off better without making everyone else poorer would be much faster with globalized trade.<p>I&#x27;m not actually sure if this is the worst answer. We frequently hear about the widening wealth gap, fixing that certainly would mean making some poorer.<p>&gt; Never mind that the world is not constant - we need innovation on the climate front if we want to stay in a stable environment that doesn’t require more sophisticated adaptation.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment behind this, I just start from a different point. I think our best chance of helping reverse the problems we cause to the environment is to first remove the worst offenders of what we do today rather than start from innovating and replacing them. I think a big mistake in the green energy movement had been assuming that it would be untenable to reduce total energy use and that we must instead replace all current use <i>and</i> match the current rate of growth in energy consumption.<p>&gt; I am sorry you have become so skeptical of progress, but I and others will continue working so that a rising tide lifts everyone, including you.<p>I&#x27;m actually not skeptical of progress, I may need to rephrase things if it comes across that way. I just view progress differently than I think many do today. Progress is often talked about as starting with what we have today and adding to it to make tomorrow better, i.e. always intervening more and never questioning how we got here. Put another way, I view progress worth having as progressing towards specific goals whether that means innovating our way out of it <i>or</i> backtracking to find another path. I don&#x27;t view progress as an incremental approach that must always push ahead without giving time and consideration to removing when we realize pur current path is fundamentally wrong.\n\n                &gt; Its an unfortunate fact of life that we can&#x27;t build a utopia with no illness or suffering.<p>That is not a fact.<p>Progress is accelerating, and we need to keep pushing. It&#x27;s the quintessential virtue.\n\n                  You honestly believe we can invent our way into a utopia with no illness, no poverty, etc?\n\n                    Yes. We&#x27;re well on our way.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;a-history-of-global-living-conditions\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;a-history-of-global-living-condit...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;world-population-in-extre...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;cancer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;cancer</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;7384515&#x2F;extreme-poverty-decline\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;7384515&#x2F;extreme-poverty-decli...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;OptimistsUnite&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1bjaog6&#x2F;fill_yer_bellies_doomers_farming_is_more&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;OptimistsUnite&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1bjaog6&#x2F;fil...</a>\n\n                      These links all reference process in specific areas with little or no context otherwise. For example, pointing to grain production increases does not acknowledge the required dependence on chemical inputs, water use, or infrastructure to move grained from large growth areas to those who actually eat it. Pointing to cancer treatment, while hugely important to those battling cancer, says nothing of what will plague us if we ever succeed in eradicating cancer.<p>If you have links or explanation of how we could possibly get to a world with no illness or suffering I&#x27;d be very interested. I&#x27;m also not expecting anything as that first depends on somehow already knowing what we don&#x27;t yet know, like what will kill people once we cure cancer.\n\n        To anyone outside the US, we don&#x27;t all agree with these blanket statements.<p>Personally I am embarrassed that we were ever involved in the middle east, am willing to see our resources spent protecting natural resources if we can afford it, want a stronger NATO and only see that happening by us leaning further in, and think the only thing bipartisan about our two presidential candidates is that there is no way they are our two best candidates for the job.\n\n    &quot;because East Asia devolves into a war stricken basket case&quot;<p>The past decade of American media has been promoting this new cold war narrative as if there is inevitably going to be a major war with China.<p>If there is war in East Asia then the whole international economic system will collapse, people will be starving in the streets. That&#x27;s if it&#x27;s not a nuclear Armageddon and we&#x27;re left to rubbing two sticks together. Nobody will care about chips if there is a war. That will be really far down the list of actual concerns<p>The world is so interconnected and everyone depends on everyone so much that there is basically no point in planning for this scenario\n\n      &gt; The world is so interconnected and everyone depends on everyone so much that there is basically no point in planning for this scenario<p>There&#x27;s always a point in planning for a scenario if you think the risk is high enough and there is something you can do to better prepare for it.<p>In this scenario, the ones most impacted immediately will be the ones most dependent of the global economy. If you can&#x27;t get the basics like food, water, and shelter if war with China breaks out then sure you&#x27;ll be in a bad spot. But is it really an impossible task to prepare at all?\n\n        I mean .. if you want to waste a bunch of money and prepare for an unlikely war then it still doesn&#x27;t make sense to worry about chips. You probably should build fallout shelters and secure things like domestic fertilizer production and the make sure agricultural equipment can be entirely made domestically<p>Even in the most benign case, if China is for whatever reason peacefully cut off from the global economy and we haven&#x27;t been nukes into the stone age - having to move back to 22nm chips is going to be the least of our problems. To put it in perspective.. this is going to be a world where we no longer have cellphones and toiletpaper (b&#x2F;c those are all made in China) and most equipment&#x2F;machinery&#x2F;refrigerators&#x2F;washing-machines&#x2F;cars&#x2F;trains will overnight become at least in part unrepairable. Basically ever sector of the economy depends at least in some small part on the Chinese supply chain.\n\n          Preparing for supply chain issues during wartime and peacetime look very similar other than defence spending. Simplifying supply chains and reducing dependencies helps whether your concern is war, a pandemic, or economic change.<p>We put chips in almost everything today. If we can live without chips them so be it, but assuming we&#x27;d rather not feel the full impact of have zero chips for whatever reason we&#x27;d be smart to start building some level of manufacturing capability at home.<p>We already saw toilet paper supply chains crumble and all it took was a (potentially over-) reaction to a potential global pandemic. It wasn&#x27;t a war with China that made it clear we really could do some good with a simplified toilet paper supply chain, it was scientific concern amplified but scared&#x2F;concerned politicians and herd mentality when the public realized they weren&#x27;t prepared for such a possible future.\n\n            What your proposing would basically entail countries indefinitely subsidizing a huge fraction of their economies so that everything is made domestically. You would just keep doing it and keep waiting for a war. It would be incredibly inefficient and make things significantly more expensive and your nation would fall behind (see North Korea). More importantly, by eliminating economic interdependence you create a much more dangerous world where demagogues can easily start wars b&#x2F;c they can be sustained by these independent domestic economies<p>But even in this horror parallel reality of yours, cutting edge chips would still be very far down the list of things that are important. Can you provide basic sanitation without anything made in China? Transport? Medical care? Can you feed your nation? Can you maintain your nations basic infrastructure?<p>Having to go back a few generations in chips is just irrelevant at the scale of disaster you&#x27;re envisioning\n\n              Why do you assume it must be driven by subsidies? Changes in demand can move the needle too, if our consumers prioritize domestic production it wouldn&#x27;t matter if technically someone could import it for cheaper.<p>If you are going government intervention, they could reach for tariffs and import taxes rather than subsidies. Forcing prices high enough for domestic production is painful at first but would eventually work all the same.<p>I fully agree with you that too much of our current infrastructure is dependent on China and other countries. It isn&#x27;t really a problem if we aren&#x27;t concerned with major shocks though. It sounds like the difference is that I see the risks high enough to invest in domestic production if possible, you see that solution as unrealistic and that we&#x27;re better off avoiding&#x2F;preventing all shocks.\n\n                I meant &quot;subsidy&quot; in a more general sense. All goods will be more expensive. More people will be in poverty<p>Imagine how much more expensive everything would be, and now imagine the cumulative amount of money that represents. Money that could be used to fund education or improve people&#x27;s lives, or even build armaments if you really are worried about the commies. You&#x27;re in effect paying an huge &quot;tax&quot;&#x2F;premium indefinitely for a threat that&#x27;s very theoretical. In so doing youre seriously slowing down the rate of progress and prosperity<p>But that goes a bit away from the original point. That even if you want to have a self reliant north Korean model for the economy, chips are not a sensible place to start. You&#x27;d probably want your local hospital to be able to run without anything made in China. Going back to 22nm (circa 2014 tech) would be a minor annoyance.\n\n                  Subsidies and tariffs have very specific meanings. They get at the same goal of increasing domestic production, but one increases government spending while the other increases government revenue through an import tax. Ultimately the domestic consumer pays either through taxes or increased prices, but they are very different mechanisms.<p>Its overly simplistic to assume that a subsidy will increase prices and harm the economy. We have been subsidizing corn for decades and it has kept prices artificially low. Prices for corn and downstream products like beef are artificially low specifically because of federal subsidies.<p>If a subsidy creates domestic jobs it could have a net benefit. The ultimate question is what metrics are impacted and at what rate. If domestic jobs are created fast enough to increase demand for employees, wages could rise faster than prices.<p>I have no idea what the end result would be, but that&#x27;s ultimately my point. Economic models are just that, models. Models are based on analysis of past events and assumptions if the future. We don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know, and we often don&#x27;t recognize how inaccurate models are when we simplify them down to a handful of measurements.<p>To your original point, hospitals do seem reasonable to focus on with regards to stability through simplified supply chains. Chips may help there, our hospitals are dependent on a huge amount of tech today. Paper, silicon, and metal products would also likely be high on the list as they are often treated as consumables - the consumable nature of those products may make them more important than chips.\n\n                    I mean that just goes against the very basics of economics.. Adam Smith, comparative advantage - and goes against the failed history of protectionist policies. You&#x27;re basically advocating a version of mercantilist theory in the 21st century.. it&#x27;s incredible anachronistic. But it&#x27;s hard to argue when you&#x27;re dismissive of all models<p>But I&#x27;m glad you see that chips are not really the top priority if this was really an issue of national safety. So one then has to wonder what are the real drivers of these jingoistic policies\n\n                      I may have dove down to many rabbit holes there, sorry if I did.<p>To wind it back a bit, are you disagreeing that with the idea that subsidies are meant to reduce consumer prices and tariffs are meant to increase prices on imported goods?<p>Or are you disagreeing with my argument that economics isn&#x27;t that simply and pulling one lever can have multiple impacts that together may move prices in an unexpected way?\n\n                        the first point is semantic, but sure. In effect a tariff functions as a subsidy for domestic companies. If it&#x27;s a net income or expense is kind of irrelevant and matter of taxation or putting the expense on consumers...<p>To the second point... it&#x27;s so vague to be meaningless. What you&#x27;re advocating is basically mercantilism - which is widely seen as ineffective and counterproductive since.. the 19th century. &quot;unexpected ways“ .. is it like the law of gravity and always going to hold? Probably not. But when you are talking about blocking international trade across whole sectors of the economy then it seems like a valid simplification. If you want to argue mercantilism is going to be a net benefit to the domestic economy then the onus is on the advocate of the outdated theory. All past historic experience points to the opposite and to the development of a stagnant backwards economy\n\n                          Mercantilism is a top-down approach, I was never promoting that. My earlier comments specifically called out what may be possible if <i>consumers</i> prioritized domestic products, the government only came into the conversation when you raised concerns over subsidies.<p>With regards to subsidies and tariffs I disagree the distinction is semantic and unimportant, though it likely is irrelevant here since I started with the concept of a change in demand at the consumer level.\n\n      In the modern world, chips are how you fight wars.\n\n      &gt; The world is so interconnected and everyone depends on everyone so much that there is basically no point in planning for this scenario<p>This sentiment was very prevalent right before WWI.\n\n  This is a re-shoring of strategic capabilities not a labor move. The labor will most likely be imported as it doesn’t really exist in the US at the scale needed with an eventual eye towards more domestic labor. Expect large numbers of imported skilled labor in the short term.\n\n    The text of the bill [^1] disagrees with this:<p>&gt; In awarding financial assistance for planning or establishing a Manufacturing USA Institute, an agency shall give special consideration to such institutes that<p>&gt; contribute to the geographic diversity of the Manufacturing USA program,<p>&gt; are located in an area with a low per capita income,<p>&gt; are located in an area with a high proportion of socially disadvantaged residents, or<p>&gt; are located in small and rural communities.<p>It seems very much to be both.<p>[^1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;117th-congress&#x2F;house-bill&#x2F;4346\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;117th-congress&#x2F;house-bill&#x2F;4346</a>\n\n      Oh yes, the bill has all kinds of nice ideas in it.<p>But then there is reality. And reality is that there isn’t some giant labor pool of fab workers in the US — yet.<p>- President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law one year ago, and semiconductor companies across the U.S. have promised to spend $231 billion on building chip manufacturing hubs on American soil.<p>- Now, as the shovels hit the ground to begin construction, companies are realizing how difficult it is to find talent.<p>- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said it had to delay production at its $40 billion Arizona plant due to a lack of workers in the U.S.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;us-chip-sector-talent-gap-emerges-as-makers-spend-billions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;us-chip-sector-talent-gap-em...</a>\n\n        Whatcha talking about? My small rural area is full of unemployed semiconductor engineers ;)<p>(Though it could be - if you can wait 20 years you could home grow it)\n\n  I imagine we’d have that skilled workforce if companies paid enough.<p>I’m a former construction contractor who reinvented myself as a software developer.<p>Each time I run into one of my former peers in the construction industry I hear the same complaints from them. “We can’t hire any good help.”  Yet they are still paying the same non living wages that they have for 30 years.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think that dynamic is the same in construction and in semiconductor manufacturing. Certain parts of the chip-building supply chain just plain don&#x27;t exist in the USA, and so no one in the USA currently has those skills. It&#x27;s not like there are lots of folks with the skills in the USA but they&#x27;re all leaving the industry for higher paying jobs.\n\n      The reason there are not a lot of folks with the skills in the USA is because 30 years ago, the US labor market did not appropriately reward those parts of the chip building supply chain.  Same dynamic as not paying construction workers enough, just with a greater time lag.\n\n        I think the distinction is still important, in that the time lag is large enough to have changed the current dynamics, even if they still match on longer timescales. Raising salaries a bit could stem the outflow of construction workers, and raising salaries sufficiently could bring folks like the prior commenter back into the industry. But as more time passes this gets less and less effective, because there&#x27;s no one left in the industry to retain and no one with recent enough knowledge to pull back in.\n\n      What skills are they, specifically? I&#x27;d like to see companies like Intel make a resource describing them, at least, and at most, offer to pay training costs and offer a job at the end of it.\n\n    To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying we can&#x27;t have this skilled workforce. Merely that we don&#x27;t have it today. So the pipeline to employ Americans for these jobs is going to require increasing the funnel of people who learn the skills, become junior engineers, learn more on the job, then become senior engineers. That&#x27;s a long pipeline to beef up the numbers.\n\n      I&#x27;m waiting for those job postings of &quot;Junior Engineer with 5 years of experience minimum&quot; in companies with zero pipeline of in-house training.\n\n    The type of work does matter. If I had the choice between a low-pay office job and a low-pay physical labor job, many would pick the office.\n\n      That depends. When I was young and the weather was nice the physical labor job sounded really nice. However physical labor also means when it is -1C and raining, or 40C with no clouds.  Now that I&#x27;m older my body isn&#x27;t willing to do that and the office job is a lot nicer (but my doctor keeps telling me to stay active)\n\n      You, sure.<p>Half the dudes in my high school class couldn’t manage to write a coherent 5 paragraph essay, so low pay office work is not really an option for them.\n\n    Not saying this with snark, but how many of those former peers work for companies with a clear pipeline to train people? Usually when I hear complaints like &quot;We can&#x27;t hire or keep good help&quot; it&#x27;s correlated with a company who isn&#x27;t willing to invest in developing their workforce.\n\n      Not sure where in construction he was, but I&#x27;ve worked framing crews before, and the boss would hire anybody (not disabled) who said they were willing to work hard.  It isn&#x27;t hard to teach someone the basic tasks and most people could catch on in just an hour.  Most people though realized it was physically hard work and quit in a week (even though this should be obvious).<p>Plumbers and electricians have a good start from nothing apprentice program. They are sometimes hard to get into, but I know a few people who have gotten in over the years.\n\n        If you are training people and they aren’t staying, isn’t the implication that you aren’t paying them enough? Those union apprenticeships are often hard to come by because 1) they pay quite well compared to other viable options and 2) people don&#x27;t want to leave because of #1. If the job is demanding, the pay should be commensurate. The exception is if it’s rewarding on some other axis (e.g., socially).\n\n    Yes and:<p>Record corporate profits while wages stagnated. Coincidence?<p>Is American labor really more expensive? Really?<p>Or do American workers simply have the unforgivable expectation of some kind of profit sharing?<p>(Yes, yes, yes. CoL in the economically important parts of America is higher. Again, the root cause being windfall profits for the elite.)\n\n    Intel pays its employees very well. They also have generous vacation allotments, and paid sabbaticals every 4 years.\n\n      For the record I am not an Intel rep lol this is just based on my opinion &amp; expedrience\n\n    Hope you’ll excuse the somewhat off-topic nature of my comment: I’d be curious in hearing your story how you transitioned into software development from construction - would you mind passing along contact information or reaching out to me? I’m in a similar boat and thinking long and hard about my options!\n\n  I don&#x27;t buy this for a minute.  It&#x27;s very easy to train people to work in factories and there are lots of Americans willing to do it if the pay is right.  These companies are just complaining so they can get more federal handouts to offset the higher labor costs of onshoring.\n\n    These are not those kinds of factories, and it&#x27;s not &#x27;easy&#x27; to train for.  And Americans are surely WILLING to do the work, but have no idea how.<p>If it was so goddamned easy to build a chip fab, they&#x27;d be all over the place - <i>everybody</i> needs them, and they&#x27;re extremely strategic.\n\n      Is it that the work is impossibly skilled or that there’s only so much demand to go around and the capital costs to build a state of the art fab is just astronomically high?\n\n        I think it&#x27;s a lot of both.<p>Like fighter jets - they&#x27;re very, very hard to fly and also expensive to build and maintain.\n\nWhat&#x27;s the most advanced node Intel is producing in the US right now in mass production?\n\n  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconangle.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;intel-begins-mass-producing-chips-using-cutting-edge-euv-technology&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconangle.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;intel-begins-mass-produc...</a><p>I believe &quot;Intel 4&quot; is their current most advanced mass-produced process.\n\n    Thanks for the response.

Many indications that this was coming.\n\n  A combination of the stock price already having that expectation built in along with CHIPS intentionally funding domestic overcapacity that has its own maintenance overhead. Chip demand is cyclical, which is why chip fabs aren&#x27;t built to handle peak demand; it would be too expensive for the times when they aren&#x27;t running at full production.\n\n  These (and probably all) are growth stocks. They have no relationships to the real world anymore unfortunately.\n\n  They didn&#x27;t get the money.  Reading the article, the first sentence explains this is just a proposal...but even the commerce.gov headline is misleadingly worded (to your point).\n\nWouldn&#x27;t GlobalFoundries (HQ in New York and supposedly on the &quot;Trusted Foundry&quot; list) have made more sense, since they fabricate chips for multiple different companies, where as Intel only makes them for Intel?<p>Boosts a competitor, opens up fab capacity for <i>all</i> and moves the needle on the intentions behind the CHIPS act, all at once.\n\n  GlobalFoudaries is receiving $1.5B from the CHIPS act. While it might have made sense to try to help them catch up to the competition a decade ago, today we just want to have any domestic capability comparable to TSMC in case China decides to invade Taiwan. Intel and TSMC will be able to get there much more quickly than GlobalFoundaries can. Furthermore, Intel is opening up their Fab to outside customers.\n\n  I’ve not been keeping up with the news but certainly within the last few months it’s been said they’re also getting money.\n\n  Intel has also been opening up their fabs to other customers in the past few months.\n\n    NVidia is actually doing a trial run of a non-critical product at Intel right now, and I&#x27;m guessing could possibly do more if it works out well.\n\n  I think Intel wants to make chips for others as well...\n\n  GlobalFoundries are nowhere near the leading edge on node process, and Intel have opened up their foundries to customers since Pat&#x27;s return with the advent of IFS: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;foundry&#x2F;overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;foundry&#x2F;overview.htm...</a>\n\n    100% right. GF is no longer gunning for leading-edge nodes. They&#x27;ve made their niche in mature nodes for low-power chips and emerging memories (FeFETS, MRAM, RRAM, etc). If you want to get leading edge nodes on American soil, Intel is the best bet.\n\n    Correction: Intel has had a Foundry business since 2010 or 2011. Then CEO Paul Otellini pushed hard for it, but had a lot of opposition internally. It then languished after he left until Pat took over.<p>It never died. It was always there. Pat&#x27;s just fulfilling the vision Paul had.\n\n      You&#x27;re right on that one, I perhaps should have more accurately said: &quot;Revive&quot;. I will say though that the scope of Paul&#x27;s vision for an Intel foundry didn&#x27;t shine a light against IFS. There wasn&#x27;t the same push for increased capacity. More so excess capacity would be given to select customers, and they might maybe increase capacity for big customers like Apple (who were with Samsung at the time rather than TSMC).<p>Some context from 2013 when they tried their hand at it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;computing&#x2F;150217-intel-pumps-up-its-foundry-business-might-snatch-apples-soc-business-away-from-samsung\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;computing&#x2F;150217-intel-pumps-up-...</a><p>It&#x27;s funny as a side note that their big foundry announcement at the time was making chips for Altera before the merger, and now Altera is parting ways with Intel after 8 years. Time flies.\n\n  Global Founders doesn&#x27;t have the capital to uphold their side of the deal this size.<p>Intel is investing 75 billion.<p>GLOBALFOUNDRIES entire market cap is 25 billion.\n\nIntel could have funded this themselves many times over if they&#x27;d reinvested their profits instead of paying huge buybacks and dividends.\n\n  The goal of a corporation is to generate value for shareholders, and we don&#x27;t give any incentives for them to do otherwise.\n\n    Corporations should only return cash to investors (via dividend or stock buyback) if they do not have a high yield way to invest the money internally.  A large stock buyback is the corporation admitting they do not have good uses for the cash.  If Intel would take these grants, tax credits, and low interest loans and turn around and increase their dividend or do a large stock buyback then this would be a simple wealth transfer from the US to Intel stock owners.  Even without this cash flow, these large grants feels like this unfairly benefits Intel shareholders at the expense of US Tax payers.<p>Intel&#x27;s last stock buyback was in Q1 2021, which was $2.4B. There were $14B in buybacks in 2020 [0].<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intc.com&#x2F;stock-info&#x2F;dividends-and-buybacks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intc.com&#x2F;stock-info&#x2F;dividends-and-buybacks</a>\n\n      I&#x27;m not sure if this was your intent, but it sounds like you&#x27;re describing the world as it actually works.<p>Companies execute stock BuyBacks when they don&#x27;t have better internal Investments, and that&#x27;s a good thing!<p>Intel doesn&#x27;t care about more us-based Fabs, nor are they high yield. This is why the US government has to pay them if the US government wants those things to exist.\n\n        &gt;  I&#x27;m not sure if this was your intent, but it sounds like you&#x27;re describing the world as it actually works.<p>This was in fact my intent.<p>I would just like to highlight there are alternative ways besides grants to encourage Intel to open US based manufacturing.  Ultimately it&#x27;s the tax payer that is funding this grant, so it&#x27;s important they feel like they are getting a good deal.  I think it&#x27;s also telling that Intel didn&#x27;t invest the $8.5B themselves when they clearly had the cash just a few years ago.\n\n          I&#x27;m curious what you think it is telling?<p>What are the alternative incentives?\n\n            1. It&#x27;s telling because if Intel thought this was a good investment then they would have made it without the grants.  The stock buybacks show they had the cash to do it recently.<p>2. Alternatives to giving grants: Tax credits, low interest loans, import duty, law, executive action, threaten anti-trust lawsuit, purchasing shares, leverage intelligence agencies, nationalize.  The most straightforward way would be to extend the regulations around exporting critical technologies to make it unfeasible for new chips to be manufactured overseas. There&#x27;s pros&#x2F;cons for all choices.\n\n              Re 1,thanks for clarification. I wasn&#x27;t sure if you thought it was a point contrary I. E. &quot;something, something, greedy&quot;<p>Re 2, it&#x27;s worth noting that the majority of Chips does come in the form of tax breaks and loans\n\n              Or Intel figured they could do stock buybacks with their own money knowing they could use someone else’s money for domestic manufacturing development?<p>A multinational needn’t be concerned with the long term prospects of any one country…<p>Oldest game in the book!<p>Have you ever seen a consulting company tell a client, “you don’t have to pay us to do your R&amp;D, we have enough money to do it ourselves!!!”\n\n        To me, unless a company is Nvidia, a stock buyback screams “we have no vision for the company’s long-term growth, let’s just prop up our options&#x2F;shares for short term personal gain”.<p>That said, I’m not a fan of pointless acquisitions either…<p>Would executives actually do buybacks if they didn’t have company shares? I suspect not!<p>At the same time, a company shouldn’t get to underpay employees, do layoffs, and stock buybacks all in the same year…\n\n          Tech companies pay their staff in RSUs. I.e. stock in their company.<p>That means either issuing more or buying some from the market. Issuing more should upset shareholders and decrease the price as they&#x27;ve been diluted.<p>Thus I expect a key driver of stock buybacks is balancing the outflow of stock to employees.\n\n      &gt; Corporations should only return cash to investors (via dividend or stock buyback) if they do not have a high yield way to invest the money internally.<p>*It should be noted that this is true due to the tax code rather than some underlying economic principle. Dividends are taxable whereas reinvesting is a tax deduction.\n\n    I ask again, who are these &quot;shareholders&quot; and why do we continue to play along with this monumental scam?\n\n      How do you think companies should work?<p>If they all re-invested all their earnings into growth, wouldn&#x27;t that mean that every company is growing un-sustainably?<p>And what is the incentive for investors to fund these companies that never return anything to the investors?\n\n        Reinvesting in growth seems more sustainable than extracting all value until the company can&#x27;t even keep up with its newer competitors.<p>There&#x27;s surely a middle ground where a company should return _excess_ profits to shareholders when they&#x27;re doing well. Intel was too busy paying out hundreds of billions to notice that Apple&#x2F;TSMC&#x2F;ARM&#x2F;AMD&#x2F;NVIDIA were eating their lunch.\n\n          That doesn&#x27;t mean that lack of funing was the problem.<p>If the company leadership can&#x27;t find a way to get a return on the money, why not take it somewhere else?<p>Intel investors sell and become Nvidia investors.<p>It seems like people have the blind assumption RnD investment always has profitable returns and is the limiting factor.<p>There are real institutional differences and limitations to what money can do.<p>You can&#x27;t drop a billion dollars on a turd and come back the next day and collect 2 billion dollars. When a company pays a dividend, it is saying that it can&#x27;t put that money to better use.\n\n            The perspective is the problem here. Looking from the angle of &quot;investor&quot; (ie, someone with capital) twists everything into a horrific hellscape. For example:<p>Suppose I own you, my slave. I can work you for ten years, collecting the profits off your labour - or I can sell your kidneys, liver, eyes and heart for a large up-front profit. One approach is long-term sustainable, the other is not.<p>But looking at it this way entirely disregards your perspective on the situation. Perhaps you would like to have a say in some of the decision making? Perhaps the owner&#x27;s profits aren&#x27;t the be-all-end-all of things?<p>You can pretend to have a billion dollars and show great concern about how to turn it into two. Or you can accept that for 99.999% of people this is an exploitative system that destroys everything of true value, in the end leaving the one biggest capitalist with a giant bag of money and nothing left to buy with it.\n\n              I dont think  it twists it. Even if the owner is the employee, the questions and calculus is the same.<p>If you work for a completely employee owned coop with a profit, would you reinvest it for less money tomorrow?<p>You can even take money out of it and talk about goods. IF your coop job runs a profit, would you rather get 2 free hams this year, or choose to wait and instead get 1 free ham next year.\n\n        I think we would all benefit most if companies were employee owned cooperatives, with everyone who has a role at the company also having a say in the overall direction the company takes.\n\n      Do you have a 401k? You are.\n\n        Each day that passes I&#x27;m getting closer to 100% believing that our economy is merely a pyramid scheme.\n\n      They&#x27;re 0.5% of the S&amp;P index. So if you have a million dollar negg egg you&#x27;ve got about $5000 with the company.\n\n  Intel could have (and has) funded building fabs themselves, but if we are advocating for a free market solution, why would they build it in the US vs somewhere cheaper? Forcing their hand to do it inside the US does not seem like a fair free market solution either. There has to be either a carrot (subsidy), or a stick (tarriffs and embargoes) to nudge them to bring it back home; neither is a clean free-market solution. The additional money is to bridge the gap and cover the unfavorable conditions for conducting the business in the US.\n\n    I just question whether the government is backing the right horse. Intel has been losing market share in every segment for years despite once having everything in their favor: a head start, a strong brand, mountains of cash. They failed to capture the mobile phone and tablet market altogether. And the govt thinks Intel can make AI chips that compete with Nvidia?\n\n      I don&#x27;t think the goal is even to compete, even though maybe it&#x27;s being sold that way. The goal is to have a domestically controlled source of relatively high tech chips. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re subpar\n\n        Global foundries seems like a better bet than intel for that objective.\n\n          Global foundries doesn&#x27;t have enough money. Intel is investing 75b in the deal. Founries is only <i>worth</i> 25B as a company.\n\n  I&#x27;m fine with dividends, but less ok with stock buybacks. I feel like buybacks lead to perverse incentives and even _greater_ levels of short-term thinking.\n\n  They DID reinvest.<p>Intel built D1X and it took forever to get working and even longer to become profitable (if it even is yet). It was a 10 year 10 billion dollar project.<p>D1X was like their entire capex budget.<p>They just flew too close to the sun and imploded with too many technical challenges.\n\nWe should give Intel 50bn of taxes, nevermind the roads, schools or anything else!  And give Google and Facebook some bns too!  And Tesla could always do with more, why not?<p>PS why not through a few bns at public housing too to preserve mixed society, like Paris?  Mixed society is surely worth it...  It&#x27;s only money!  And it won&#x27;t spend itself!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39765692\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39765692</a>\n\nToo big to fail coming the rounds again?<p>Intel failed to keep up with competition due to some really bad decisions \nand incompetence.<p>Now they are bailed out by the Biden administration with a giant\nstate subsidy. I think this falls under protectionism.\nwhich might cause problems with the WTO.<p>I would guess the administration will or already have filed it under \n&quot;National security&quot; or something similar.<p>Where does this money come from?\nHas it been fully funded by congress? (hopefully)\n\nI think actually the problem with this program is not the recipient (I mean, Intel is literally the only American company building fabs in the US) but the structure. The problem with US fans is that the skilled Taiwanese workforce is simply willing to work for less and more flexibly.<p>We could easily solve that problem if we were willing to do what China is doing, which is paying Taiwanese PhDs, engineers, and technicians to come to the US. Give them a streamlined visa and green card process, and pay them a cash bonus to emigrate.<p>I mean, this is America’s core strength - we have strong Taiwanese communities they could integrate into, a social structure that is ultimately much more positive on immigrants than most places in the world, and incredibly high salaries.<p>A lot of people talk about training a US workforce, and I totally agree we should embrace that. But there are limits, and ultimately as a country we should encourage skilled immigration whenever and however we can. After all they’ll train locals eventually, even if by proximity.\n\n  Absolutely, we should be trying extremely hard to skim the cream of the rest of the world. That&#x27;s historically been one of our greatest strengths&#x2F;abilities.\n\n  100% this.\n\n  &gt; Taiwanese PhDs, engineers, and technicians to come to the US<p>Isn&#x27;t this already present in H1B and other Skilled &#x2F; extraordinary persons programs?\n\n    From the position of high value employee making good living: If I get a green card I will move. If I get a visa that ties me to employer and I am at the constant threat of being kicked out then fuck it.\n\n  I bet that the minute the US rolls up red carpet to Taiwan&#x27;s hi tech experts will be the minute Taiwan will fight it either soft way (increase the salaries) or the hard way (introduce the laws preventing them from leaving the country). Should Taiwan loose leading position their value and security guarantees will all go down the toilet.\n\n  &gt; We could easily solve that problem if we were willing to do what China is doing, which is paying Taiwanese PhDs, engineers, and technicians to come to the US. Give them a streamlined visa and green card process, and pay them a cash bonus to emigrate.<p>Well actually ... TSMC poached a number of Intel employees (who already had green cards and&#x2F;or naturalized citizens). If Intel could have paid them more to stay, I&#x27;m sure they would have.\n\nWe&#x27;re living through the silicon age and Intel has made a total dog&#x27;s breakfast of it.<p>Stagnant revenues, falling profits. Both should have been growing geometrically.<p>Just compare these companies:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;INTC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;INTC</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AMD\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AMD</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AVGO\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AVGO</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AMAT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AMAT</a><p>Even Qualcomm has seen good growth:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;QCOM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;QCOM</a><p>This is how it&#x27;s done:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;NVDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;NVDA</a><p>EDIT these guys aren&#x27;t primarily chipmakers, but they&#x27;re deriving at least a couple of $Bn per year from making good ones: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AAPL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;AAPL</a>\n\n  Well, you can chase short term profit and send your designs off to TSMC, or you can own your own foundry. This is exactly why it&#x27;s in the interest of the US government to ensure that Intel doesn&#x27;t totally abandon US manufacturing just like AMD did years ago.\n\n    Not saying INTC isn&#x27;t valuable - just saying they seem to have missed the boat in a big way and changes are in order.<p>The US does of course need on-shore chip foundries for strategic reasons.\n\n      Pat Gelsinger only returned 3 years ago, it just takes a while for changes to propagate through an org as large as Intel.\n\n        I hope you turn out to be right.\n\n        +1 this.\nIntel let MBA-think drive too many decisions (ie EUV).  Maybe there was some misperception there, even cultural bias.<p>Pat&#x27;s biggest real change has been to push the company towards process leadership.  They always had good designs, though perhaps also damaged by MBA-think there too.<p>Still not sure about the decision to get out of non-volatile memory, though perhaps that was just a scope decision.  Obviously, you could make a pretty amazing AI device with a whole bunch of NVM in-package...\n\n      It was not obvious to Intel leadership that the future of manufacturing was to become a contracted fabricator of the design of other companies.  Vertical integration and total control over both design and manufacture of chips was the obvious (and, until recently) successful path.  What board would keep an Intel CEO that presented the idea of shifting the primary focus of the company to manufacturing the designs of other companies whose products are in direct competition to Intel?<p>Intel is a perfect example of why companies need to regularly kill their old selves in order to survive.  But it&#x27;s also a perfect example of why so many companies fail to do so, since it often involves making what appears to be a terrible decision at the time, and convincing a bunch of people who know better to back you up.  Very few leaders have the clout to pull this off.<p>The success of TSCM was the result of an interesting confluence of events: including the existence of ARM; Apple deciding that they were going to design their own hardware and outsource its manufacture; Nvidia developing CUDA; and the machine learning&#x2F;AI revolution that drove demand for Nvidia cards.<p>If you take away any of those pieces, I think TSCM doesn&#x27;t become the powerhouse it is today.\n\n        It&#x27;s TSMC. Their rise is waaay before Apple or ARM. Plug and play fab model made getting into semiconductor design as a start-up possible. Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Conexant etc all used TSMC in 90s, way before smart phones and ARM-mania. Intel saw this coming but they were ahead and they didn&#x27;t worry about it. At the end they got stuck at getting bad yield from their FinFETs, which is invented by Intel, while TSMC and Samsung moved forward. Iphones would have been using Intel processors if Intel had a competing product to be honest. They screwed that up too. TSMC and Samsung just had the right mindset and focus, and a lot of smart and hardworking people.\n\n    And yet the US has been the biggest pusher of comparative advantage economics for everyone else via the world bank and imf. What is good for the goose is apparently not good for the gander.<p>Though I totally agree with the strategic imperative I just wish the rest of us non US countries would wake up to it and stop allowing Western countries to extract economic rent by capturing strategic monopolies on energy, goods and services.\n\n    Short term profit focus is arguably what led to Intel&#x27;s engineering decline in the 2010s, despite what you say. An HN comment once recounted how they had spun off engineers into a another company and then merged with it again in a play to avoid pension obligations. That led to at least one frustrated engineer leaving and wishing them &quot;good luck with 10nm&quot;.\nYou often see other comments talking about how underpaid these highly educated workers are. Things seem hopeful that with Gelsinger at the helm, they may continue on the right path.\n\n  No shock that profits are failing when they are investing heavily\n\n    I&#x27;m not an accountant but they should be able to capitalize expenses incurred when it&#x27;s an investment, ie, since it&#x27;s not really a normal expense profit should not be affected.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that works with R&amp;D engineering salaries - that might impact their profits even if it&#x27;s an investment.<p>I feel like a large technology company should spend a large but consistent amount of money on R&amp;D - I don&#x27;t like wild swings either way.\n\n      Also not an accountant, but i believe you two are talking differently about gaap and nongaap profit. The latter can immediately write of R&amp;D, where as GAAP has rules around deprecation of investments.\n\n  How do you come off with a straight face attempting to compare a bunch of fabless design houses with a company that actually owns the infrastructure and processes to make tangible products, even if not the prevailing sexiest thing?<p>You&#x27;re living in a bubble if you think the biggest money printer in the world actually cares about the historical performance of your cherry-picked stock comparisons.\n\n    Then let&#x27;s look at TSMC: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;TSM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valustox.com&#x2F;TSM</a>\n\n      I&#x27;ve been looking for TSMC within the domestic borders of CONUS for longer than you might imagine.<p>Reiterating, the money printer doesn&#x27;t give a flying fuck about stock price trends.\n\n    Not 100% sure what you mean or why you&#x27;re so antagonistic. Who&#x27;s the money printer in your comment?<p>Why are my stock comparisons cherry-picked? The companies I listed make money from chips. Besides - any investor can compare any two companies for market cap, revenue, and profit, even if one makes chips and the other sells sugary drinks.\n\n      My response was nothing more than a reflection of your remark echoed from a very different perspective.<p>The money printer I&#x27;m alluding to is the US federal government. They own the proverbial money trees that $8.5B in grants will be plucked from.<p>The US federal government is also the investor. They couldn&#x27;t care less that the companies you&#x27;re attempting to compare against &quot;make money from chips&quot;. If the government wants money, they print it, end of story. Furthermore, these irrelevant companies aren&#x27;t getting $8.5B big bucks for the simple reason that they <i>don&#x27;t have the independent capacity to make their own semiconductor products</i>...they&#x27;re fabless design houses, dependent on other companies&#x27; infrastructure and processes...more specifically, a certain most excellent company whose bleeding edge infrastructure and processes are physically located at the doorsteps of its greatest economic adversary.<p>What the US federal government more immediately cares about are sufficiently advanced fab owner operators, more specifically, those rooted deeply in domestic soil...and who better to incentivize than a domestic former alpha dog who ate his own breakfast. Intel isn&#x27;t leading at the margins anymore, but they&#x27;re certainly not out of the game.<p>If you&#x27;re still not seeing the bigger picture, then I&#x27;d recommend reading this recently discussed[1] short story by Arthur C. Clarke to get a relevant feel for the underlying threat landscape.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39737084\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39737084</a>\n\n  Intel can save a lot of money by getting rid of incompetent folks in higher management, closing a lot of projects&#x2F;teams that do not add value, a lot of middle management, simplifying processes that slow down the teams that are actually doing job, changing culture where working 10hr&#x2F;wk is not tolerated. They need to do some variation of what Elon did to twitter. I have seen many of these things first hand.\n\n    I agree - management cruft abounds in most large corps. The hard thing is you need a really skilled CEO to cut through all of it correctly.\n\n    I don’t think twitter is a really good example considering its equity value has fallen precipitously under his reign.\n\n      I am not saying Intel needs to cut 80% like twitter, what I am trying to say that Intel can cut a lot without any impact.\n\n    &gt; closing a lot of projects&#x2F;teams that do not add value<p>I hear what you&#x27;re saying, but that&#x27;s also kind of how they got in trouble isn&#x27;t it? They had an ARM license and a good implementation (at the time) StrongARM, but they shut that down just before smart phones hit. Intel is notorious for shutting down projects like that just before they could have been profitable so they can &quot;focus on their core competencies&quot;.<p>&gt; They need to do some variation of what Elon did to twitter.<p>Doing to Intel what Elon did to Twitter sounds like a disaster. Yes, Intel needs a shakeup, but don&#x27;t completely destroy it. It&#x27;s the largest chipmaker in the US and has actual fabs. I think Gelsinger is on the right track, but it&#x27;s going to take time.\n\n    &gt; They need to do some variation of what Elon did to twitter.<p>What nonsense. Since Elon&#x27;s purge Twitter has had and endless number of persistent issues that frankly are amature hour level bugs.<p>He filtered developers by demanding they bring a printout of source code and explain it to him, when it&#x27;s clear if you&#x27;ve ever seen him talk in detail about software he actually understands almost nothing about the process and details of writing code. This is both an ineffective and unfair way of deciding whether or not to fire someone.<p>He also lost about half of Twitter&#x27;s advertisers in a matter of weeks.<p>I believe in fairness and honesty, so I will say Elon is exceptional at selling investors and customers on a technological vision. Saying his mindset and approach would have made Intel far more successful in recent decades is preposterous.\n\n  &gt;&gt; dog&#x27;s breakfast<p>Native English speaker here, I&#x27;ve never heard this expression before?\n\n    It&#x27;s an idiom meaning an unappealing mixture or a disorderly situation. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;dog%27s_breakfast\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;dog%27s_breakfast</a>\n\n    Not sure about elsewhere, but it’s a common expression in the UK.\n\n    A lot of places and definitely historically whatever scraps were left from dinner would be the dog&#x27;s breakfast bowl tomorrow.\n\n    Dogs get whatever is left over.\n\n    I think dog’s dinner is way more common in the UK\n\n  It blows my mind how much these large firms have totally dropped the ball. It&#x27;s like IBM levels of decline.\n\n  Only one of the companies you listed makes chips.\n\n  Why worry about revenue and profits or sustainability when the government will just bail you out?<p>May as well just loot the coffers, pay seven figure bonuses, and then go back cap in hand to the taxpayer.<p>And we call this “capitalism”.\n\nnah, semiconductor design, fab and research would still pay like shit. Go back to building your CRUD apps.\n\nWRT to lack of a skilled workforce, here is an interesting anecdote.  I remember back in the late 90&#x27;s, Intel had to fire most line workers in their FABS, and hire people with Ph.D.&#x27;s in solid-state physics.<p>I actually knew one of these people who were fired:  She was our housecleaner.  And--like the supper-smart garbage man of the Dilbert Cartoons, she was very smart.  Smarter than me. I know because she helped me solve some problems I couldn&#x27;t solve on my own.<p>Why was she cleaning houses?   Tragic story.  No doubt she could have gotten a Ph.D., but she was older, had some health problems which wouldn&#x27;t let her work 60-80 hours a week.  And she was black, perhaps discrimination was a factor too.<p>I&#x27;d hate to even think of how smart you have to be to work in FABs today, but let me tell you, not even $8.5 billion is going to create more of these people.  Best you can hope for is you can pay them enough to get them to work for you.\n\n  Maybe too much money is exactly the problem? I rarely see people tackling hard problem for money, because it is not an efficient way of making money.\n\n    Too much money in what context? It can be an extremely effective motivator for solving a business problem - hire smart people to work on it, they&#x27;ll happily go work for double their pay.\n\n      A baby can&#x27;t be made in one month just because you had the money to hire 9 surrogates.<p>Many processes do not scale just because a money spigot turned on. What most often does scale as quickly as monetary availability is fraud, waste and abuse.\n\n        There are thousands of items on the agenda in the present day, everything from better open source LLMs to moon-base railway designs, so even if 99% of these turn out to be duds that can’t be budged, there are still sufficiently many remaining to absorb all bonafide super-geniuses on Earth several times over.\n\n          In this particular item on the agenda, chip fabs, it is not clear spending more money one time will produce a result, much less a faster result by attracting &quot;bonafide super-geniouses.&quot; One might respond that &quot;you can&#x27;t win if you don&#x27;t play&quot; which would lay bare the gamble.\n\n            Chip fabs is just one of ‘many processes’ which was what I was replying to. It’s practically irrelevant if even 99% of all processes have this characteristic. There’s way more than enough remaining to occupy all available people who could actually speed up large complex projects by 10x.<p>Of course if they were somehow disproportionately forced to only ever work on chip fabs for the rest of their lives, then that would create huge waste, but this doesn’t seem likely.\n\n          That&#x27;s exactly the problem. We don&#x27;t have an abundant supply of supergeniuses\n\n            If there was an ‘abundant supply’ most of them wouldn’t be considered such any longer, just regular geniuses, because the population average would have been raised up.\n\n        Couldn&#x27;t you keep hiring surrogates until you get a premature birth?\n\n    While you could convince me that too much money would attract the wrong type of people, you would be hard pressed to find more competent people by offering less money. (I&#x27;m not dismissing that there are other motivations involved, just the ability to grow a talent pool by offering less.)\n\n      Once you have a &quot;good life&quot; you start looking for other things than money.  I know a few people who have quit a good job they didn&#x27;t like for one that paid a little less but they liked more.  Though there is a limit to how far someone can go down in pay before they don&#x27;t like the new job because of pay.\n\n  That&#x27;s a silly anecdote and I have a hard time believing chip fab line workers are too much different from those in other types of high-tech (where I spent 15 years working on test automation &amp; quality systems).  Some smart folks, for sure, but almost zero roles required even actual engineering background.  A lot of management had strong technical education, but the vast majority of line workers are just following simple instructions.<p>I could be wrong about how fabs work, of course, and would love to learn more.\n\n    Having seen a few &#x27;high tech&#x27; places myself: there&#x27;s high tech, and then there&#x27;s _high tech_.<p>Assembling a motherboard is to semiconductor fabs as flying a toy drone is to landing a Boeing 747. One you can learn in an afternoon; the other takes years to learn.\n\n      You cannot learn to assemble a motherboard using modern manufacturing equipment in an afternoon. Pick-and-place operation is a week-long course alone (specific to that machine, and assuming you are already familiar with the process), and there are at least a screen printer and reflow oven involved as well.\n\n        Yea fair lol - def an exaggeration. (And my experience is def not first hand, here)<p>But still - a lot easier than semiconductors\n\n      One of the most critical aspects of engineering is making it so advanced high tech things can be manufactured by the least skilled and least number of skilled people possible.<p>Don&#x27;t confuse that with the workers not being skilled - many are, but just like good software, you want your designs to run well even when executed by the worst hardware.\n\n        Actually engineering often means need more skilled workers as the unskilled work was replaced.  1 person running the machine who understands more of the engineering as opposed to 100 with a saw.\n\n      Making PhD engineers operate&#x2F;maintain&#x2F;monitor a wire bonding machine seems expensive.<p>I worked in an R&amp;D fab (albeit, as an intern, many years ago) with an abnormal number of PhDs around (the fab was essentially a small scale test bed for new products and processes - everything tested there first before scaling up overseas). I think we had a 5:1 ratio of techs to engineers. This was in a fab that basically did nothing but R&amp;D and low volume manufacturing for defense.<p>It&#x27;s comparable to any kind of high-tech manufacturing where you have engineers designing&#x2F;testing stuff (and designing the tools to make and test the stuff in the first place) while there have to be techs&#x2F;mechanics&#x2F;machine shop workers to actually do the work of making it. It&#x27;s inefficient and expensive to put the engineers on that task, while they&#x27;ll still need to do it from time to time.\n\n      &gt; Assembling a motherboard is to semiconductor fabs as flying a toy drone is to landing a Boeing 747.<p>I disagree.  I live next to a fab and have coworkers that have worked the fabs.<p>Humans in fabs are taken out of the loop as much as possible.  That&#x27;s because when dealing with nanoscale structures, human error is simply too common.<p>One of my coworkers worked at the fab during a period where they had humans running the forklift that moved the wafers from one stage to the next.  That was cut out because the tiny bumps caused by a human operating the controls caused imperfections in the chips that decreased yield (the metric that matters most for a fab).  They ultimately removed that work and job and replaced it with robots to carefully move the wafers.<p>What&#x27;s complex about a fab ends up being not the frontline work, but rather the layer or 2 in the back (like designing the lithography filter for a given chip).  That stuff happen outside the actual plant.\n\n        &gt; Humans in fabs are taken out of the loop as much as possible.<p>This.  We are talking about Atom scale here.  I have as much admiration for skilled mechanics as the next guy.  I heard about a lathe operator at Patek Phillip who could turn an arbor to within 1 micron precision, just by listening to the pitch the cutting tool made when trimming it down.<p>And when chip features were on the micron scale, humans in the loop made sense.  But chip feature are ten thousand times smaller than that now--4 orders of magnitude.  Anything that doesn&#x27;t need a Ph.D. in solid state physics to do is going to be automated.\n\n          I&#x27;m probably revealing exactly which fab, but one issue the fab had is when it was built it was placed fairly close to the interstate.  That did no matter when they were at something like 500nm.  However, as they slowly pulled the node size down they started noticing random errors within their chips.  It took a while to track it down but it turns out semi trucks driving past the interstate were causing defects in the chips.<p>They ended up installing shock absorbers everywhere to counteract this problem.\n\n          There are still, though, lots of working fabs at much larger process sizes.  And some for things that won&#x27;t ever modernize to a smaller one.  Like parts that handle lots of power, or chips for RF purposes, etc.\n\n        I think we agree? The point is that a semiconductor fab (like a 747) is so highly automated that you don&#x27;t need a bunch of low- or medium-skilled folks to drive forklifts; you need a few high-skills folks to design, monitor, debug &amp; optimize the huge system(s).\n\n      I think you underestimate the amount of people with high school education doing very precise, skilled work right now. Do you think skilled machines tend to have PHds or even bachelors?<p>Im not saying its as simple as CNC. I am saying that I doubt you need an IQ of 130 or a PHD. Start investing in the people whose labor were undercut. In fact a skilled machinist or technician seems like a much closer match (in terms of skill and willingness to do the job) than some with an electrical engineering PHD or something.\n\n        Skilled machinists?\n\n          It takes education and practice to take a CAD model or technical drawings and run the machines to produce it.\n\n            Sorry, I was just trying to clarify what &quot;skilled machines&quot; meant. I think they meant &quot;skilled machinists&quot;?\n\n      &gt; Assembling a motherboard is to semiconductor fabs as flying a toy drone is to landing a Boeing 747.<p>A 747 can pretty much land itself on autopilot.\n\n        What are the conditions and steps necessary to engage autopilot during landing? What are the failure conditions, and the steps necessary during a malfunction when autopilot is engaged?\n\n          On a clear day with perfect conditions ground control can probably get you on the ground and you walk away safely.  The plane may not be safe to fly again, but you walk away.  When there is bad weather (common) or other mechanical issues you need a lot more training, and of course if you want the plane to survive to fly again you want some more training.<p>The only hard part is contacting ground control in the first place.  Radio frequencies change all the time.\n\n            <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;travel&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;passengers-try-landing-plane-flight-simulator&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;travel&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;passengers-...</a><p>WaPo tried it out last year and only the fellow who was used to WW2 plane simulators was successful at a probably didn&#x27;t die landing.\n\n      &gt; Assembling a motherboard is to semiconductor fabs as flying a toy drone is to landing a Boeing 747. One you can learn in an afternoon; the other takes years to learn.<p>The hard one to learn is flying a drone, right?\n\n    Just in case they are paying attention, I would love to relocate and go to work for Intel. Following simple instructions sounds terrific, to me. Where do I send my resume?\n\n    I think people are also underestimating the intelligence of people in the once very large manufacturing workforce.\n\n      It doesn&#x27;t help that the union culture is opposed to promoting smart people.  If you work an assembly line you are not better than anyone else on the line, so their position makes sense - smart people are not worth more.  However it also means smart people that want to move to management (want - if you are content that is your choice) find things worse: you are required to start at the bottom and your previous experience doesn&#x27;t count for anything (including the pension)\n\n        The decline in American manufacturing happened alongside a decline in union membership in manufacturing. If unions were the causal factor, why do these trends coincide rather than oppose?<p>Alternative theory: Protectionism industrializes and trade liberalization deindustrializes. Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s protectionist policies weren&#x27;t just successful at industrializing the USA, he and his successors were correct as to why they were successful. The relatively recent shift to trade liberalization, by contrast, had the generally accepted effect of such policies on the industrial base. Of course, assets got pumped along the way and that&#x27;s what really mattered to the people in charge.\n\n          Trade liberalization industrializes <i>the world</i>.<p>Unions were gutted because the labor market grew beyond international borders, but the labor movement didn&#x27;t (thanks to western capitalists making war on socialists.)\n\n          the only cause here is higher wages make other countries more compelling.<p>The not promoting is a problem but it isn&#x27;t the cause of decline.\n\n    &gt; but almost zero roles required even actual engineering background<p>Small anecdote: pat gelsinger, intel ceo, started as a technician at intel (iirc) at like years old or something like that.<p>That entry level job paid enough that he could have a roof on his head and i guess covered his university tuition?<p>I’m not making this up: it’s all in his book he wrote about his life (not sure I recommend the book)\n\n      True, but Pat Gelsinger isn&#x27;t a good example of what public policy we should pursue to help Joe six-packs enjoy a middle-class life.  Gelsinger is one of the few people I would follow blindly into the maws of hell itself; his intellect is exceeded only by his ability to lead.\n\n        LTI and Santa Clara are not public institutions.\n\n        Have you worked with the guy, like, in person or are you just being an enthusiastic fan?<p>Just trying to understand your point of view.\n\n        I am a little bit fascinated by the way that many people seem to think so highly of Gelsinger, and I even think it is possible that he will succeed in leveraging that to make Intel competitive.<p>However, just from his public persona of wildly optimistic sales&#x2F;marketing pitches and showmanship, while outsourcing their own manufacturing to TSMC, I have a very bad impression.<p>Then his claims of Intel zettaflop machines by 2027 honestly make me think he is totally delusional, but maybe that does not matter.\n\n    You&#x27;re missing the broader point here which is that TSMC pays roughly $50k&#x2F;year for people with these skills. Sure, you may be able to find the talent pool, but at what price?\n\n      I think an important question here is: how exactly can TSMC <i>afford</i> to pay $50k for people with these skills?  And why is that impossible in the US?  I think this comes down to relative cost-of-living differences: the US is just too expensive to live in these days.  Taiwan is <i>not</i> a super low-cost-of-living country by any means, but the US has gotten ridiculously expensive compared to most other peer nations, and this means it&#x27;s pricing itself out of the market with anything where it needs to compete.<p>Personally, I think America&#x27;s reliance on cars and its suburban layout is a big part of this.  Workers in Taipei don&#x27;t need to own a car to get to work, and the overall infrastructure cost per capita is much lower.\n\n  Could her health problem stem from the fact that she worked at the chip fab? Those places are notorious for using chemicals that are harmful to humans.\n\n  This award isn&#x27;t about innovation, the best way to do things, or job requirements.<p>This about supply chain security and national defense. So many of our components are made overseas and under governments who are not close allies. This is in order to operate things in our country.<p>When you have the FABs in the US and under US control you can handle international foreign policy and the security of the nation differently.\n\n    Fair enough. But then the question is: How did this happen in the first place? If the Pentagon is playing out scenerio after scenerio after scenerio, how did we allow ourselves to be so embarrassingly venerable?<p>And now the taxpayer is on the hook for $8.5B and growing?<p>There&#x27;s a certain smell to all this.\n\n      &gt; How did this happen in the first place?<p>By not pursuing protectionist public policies.<p>&gt;  the taxpayer is on the hook for $8.5B<p>$8.5B is a big price tag, but whether the government should spend it or not depends on whether or not the investment pays off.\n\n        This is way bigger than trade policies. Intel was the world leader in chip-making until fairly recently. Steve Jobs wanted them to build the iPhone chips because they were a generation or two ahead of any other fab in the world. Today, Intel is no longer leading the world in chip fab process.<p>Intel at the time wasn&#x27;t interested in fabing ARM chips, and the rest is history.<p>Intel and American fabs fell behind for a number of reasons. Some of it is tied to our education system and the kinds of people we are training. Some of it is probably related to Intel turning their nose up at the iPhone chip making, losing billions upon billions of money they could have put into R&amp;D. Some of it is a story of American corporate culture not innovating enough.\n\n          &gt; the kinds of people we are training<p>I was a physics student who took a nanofab class, fell in love, and desperately wanted to go down this path... until I learned about how complete and utter dogshit the wages were. I kept in touch with two classmates who stuck with it a bit longer. The free market had to beat them over the head a bit longer to get them to let go, but it eventually succeeded. Intel was absolutely printing money for investors the whole time, of course, and now that the material consequences of their poor management have come home to roost they are getting bailouts. Yay, capitalism!<p>Our education system over-produces qualified scientists, but if semiconductors are a road to not having a house or family and if it pays 5x better to sell ads or stocks... you get what you pay for.<p>I hope this has changed but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it.\n\n          &gt; Intel at the time wasn&#x27;t interested in fabing ARM chips, and the rest is history.<p>Fun fact, in the late 90&#x27;s, Intel was the biggest manufacturer of ARM chips.  I was there at the time, and I wrote lots of software to aid in their design.<p>What happened to Intel was twofold:   The first problem was that Robert Noyce, Andy Grove, And Gordon Moore died.  Each one was a once-in-century intellect, and it took Intel a while to be able to find somebody who could remotely fill those shoes.<p>The second problem was Intel was making so much money on x86 chips, that dedicating any fab capacity to anything else--including chips for Apple&#x27;s iPhone, would for years have had such a huge opportunity cost, that the shareholders would have sued, and with cause.  Because literally (not metaphorically) anything they would have manufactured instead would have had a drastically lower profit margin, and the stock would have tanked.<p>I suspect that the only reason Intel made a foray into ARM chips in the first place was to head off anti-trust accusations, and once the political heat was off, they dropped them like they were hot.<p>By the time the market shifted, almost a generation of mediocre management had left Intel less paranoid, and therefore, less likely to survive.\n\n            It&#x27;s also interesting that Intel made some specific bad technical choices.<p>(ie, not investing in EUV, assuming SAQP would work forever, ignoring the consequences of everything being power-limited...)<p>This kind of decision is hard, because it&#x27;s a technical-economic tradeoff, and the latter is more voodoo than math.  And that&#x27;s not even addressing whether you get surprised by things like the LLM boom...\n\n              You say:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also interesting that Intel made some specific bad technical choices.<p>That&#x27;s like saying Saudi Arabia made some bad policy decisions.  If you are in Saudi Arabia, nothing has a higher return on investment than petroleum.  If you invest in anything else, you are leaving money---A LOT of money--on the table.<p>The result is that capital is drained out of any other business, and the country gets so dependent on just one industry that when the oil runs out, it is a major crisis.<p>Put yourself in the place of an Intel CEO.  You&#x27;ve just invested $4 Billion in a fab.  People will by absolutely every single x86 chip that fab will make ~$40 billion over the course of the technology node&#x27;s life time.<p>Or, you could make chips for the iPhone, which maybe, perhaps would be a hit?  And even if Apple&#x27;s wildest projections come true, you&#x27;ll make $8 billion instead of $40 billion, because Apple is not going to pay for Intel to pocket a 90% profit margin, when it could just go to TSMC.<p>So you are a CEO, and wondering how on the next earnings call you are going to justify turning an asset worth $40 Billion into one worth $8 billion....\n\n                Was it not possible to build two fabs and make $48 billion?\n\n                  What would you do?  Build two fabs and make $48 billion, or build two fabs and make $80 billion?<p>It might be hard to remember now, but Intel was in the position NVIDIA is today:  they could sell absolutely every x86 processor they could make, at pretty much any price they cared to name.<p>So <i>even if</i> Intel could have built another fab (which, btw, it couldn&#x27;t, the world only graduates so many solid-state physics Ph.D.&#x27;s per year) but even if they could, they would <i>STILL</i> have used it to make x86 chips.  Literally (not metaphorically or hyperbolically) nothing else they could manufacture would have as high a return on investment as making x86 chips did.\n\n                    I don’t buy this completely. AMD’s 64-bit humiliation of Intel wasn’t that far in the past, and they knew GPUs were important. They could have hedged their bets a bit more on the basis of sound business management without incurring shareholder wrath.\n\n                    Google&#x2F;Alphabet and Facebook&#x2F;Meta sunk billions into ventures that aren’t half as profitable as your hypothetical 8B deal, and shareholders haven’t sued yet.<p>Of course the founders have majority voting shares, but that doesn’t prevent them from being sued. It only prevents them&#x2F;their designated CEO from being fired.\n\n                      Theres a few differences between Intel and Google here.  The first two points are from Peter Thiel:<p>1.  Google really didn&#x27;t know what to do with its excess money, which was why it was just stockpiling it and not using it to invest in its own business.<p>Intel, by contrast, <i>always</i> knew (at least in the Noyce&#x2F;Grove era) what to do with its money.<p>2.  Google&#x27;s &quot;side projects&quot; were false-flags and smokescreens to make it look like it wasn&#x27;t a monopoly.  (Thiel says it much better himself in his article and speech titled &quot;competition is for losers&quot;-highly recommended).<p>Intel did a similar thing around the turn of the century, when it started making ARM chips--not because they were the most profitable thing they could be doing but because they didn&#x27;t want to look like a monopoly.<p>And, of course, you really hit the nail on the thumb here:<p>&gt; Of course the founders have majority voting shares<p>Yeah.  The executives of google and facebook just don&#x27;t face the same accountability from the shareholders that the execs of any honestly-governed public company does.<p>Its a two-edged sword: if google or facebook needs to spend a lot of money to pivot, they have the flexibility to do that in a way which other companies don&#x27;t.  However, the flip side implication is that, e.g. Zuckerberg can just spend $10 billion on a huge project, without being at all held accountable if it fails.\n\n                        Right, and the ironic thing is that the founder having majority voting shares was allegedly justified by the idea that it would solve the innovators dilemma by not having the founders (&quot;proven&quot; capable of building successful products) being accountable to the short-term whims of the shareholder.<p>That said... my original point was that the shareholders don&#x27;t <i>sue</i> in such situations. Rather, they just vote out the board (and hence CEO). If they could sue the board&#x2F;CEO for not making as much profit as theoretically possible, they would have already sued Meta or Alphabet already despite having only minority shares. Proving to a court that the board&#x2F;CEO isn&#x27;t acting in the shareholder&#x27;s best interest isn&#x27;t as easy as comparing the projected returns of two mutually-exclusive deals -- they can argue that the ostensibly less profitable deal actually has great long term benefits.\n\n                          &gt; don&#x27;t sue in such situations. Rather, they just vote out the board<p>cf. with the shareholder suit against Tesla. Why did they sue instead of firing the board of directors?<p>To vote out the board, you need &gt;50% of the shareholders to back you.  To sue the board, all you need is 1 disgruntled investor.\n\n                &gt; and the country gets so dependent on just one industry that when the oil runs out, it is a major crisis.<p>Good thing we aren’t even slightly close to ever running out.\n\n            It seems that what happened to Intel was a lot worse than just missing Andy Grove&#x27;s paranoia...<p>- They missed the mobile market<p>- They missed the gaming market<p>- They missed the AI&#x2F;ML market<p>- They got multiple generations behind TSMC and Samsung in the fab business<p>- They lost a whole bunch of market share to AMD, including datacenter<p>The NY Times article is paywalled, so I can&#x27;t read it, but I have to wonder what kind of fabs they are meant to be building for our (taxpayers) $8.5B ? I wouldn&#x27;t have any faith in them building a SOTA fab at this point.\n\n              When you connect those dots this feels more like a pseudo bailout in disguise.\n\n                Oh, its not a pseudo bailout. It&#x27;s a bailout full stop.  Doesn&#x27;t mean its a bad idea.\n\n                  8 billion can&#x27;t build half a fab though.\n\n                This is exactly what it is. With the added issue that, in all likelihood, $8B is not even enough to start making a change. The US gov would have a better time giving these $8B to startup companies in the chip space. Intel will just squander this money and give some of it to shareholders.\n\n              You are forgetting two things:<p>1.  All those happened after Andy Grove&#x27;s time.<p>2.  And when Andy Grove <i>was</i> at the helm, Intel did not miss opportunities like that.  E.g. when Intel&#x27;s memory chip business started losing market share to the Japanese (who were at the time a low-wage country), they were able to transition to CPUs in time.\n\n                Yeah, but what I meant is that these can&#x27;t all be explained by not being paranoid (letting the competition creep up on you), or even by not having an exceptional CEO.<p>If you are in the business of making CPUs, and obviously aware of how fast things move in the tech world, then how can you not be aware of industry trends going on like smart phones, gaming and AI? If you are somehow late to see the trend then double down and catch up. What about getting behind on process nodes&#x2F;generations? This used to be one of Intel&#x27;s core strengths, and you&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d have institutionalized the things you do and don&#x27;t take on in a new process to keep the change manageable.<p>So, I wouldn&#x27;t say it just a matter of not having Andy Grove - it seems like a matter of having incompetence at many levels.\n\n              Actually, Intel has been consistent with their specialized CPU DNN libraries and whatnot for years. MKL and the likes are pervasive in modern deep learning stacks. Pretty sure they&#x27;ve captured as much of the AI&#x2F;ML business as CPUs possibly can.<p>Also, by gaming do you mean gaming consoles or gaming PCs? Because Intel is popular in gaming PCs also.\n\n                Sure, but those are CPU libraries, but what has grown NVIDIA into a $2T company wasn&#x27;t building CPUs - it was building processors specific to this new and exploding field of ML&#x2F;AI, which grew out of them building processors (GPUs) specific to the growing field of realtime PC-based gaming...<p>Is the problem that Intel saw themselves too narrowly as in the CPU business rather than as in the compute business? I&#x27;ve no idea - it&#x27;d be interesting to hear the inside story of how all these missed opportunities went down.\n\n                  I mean, if your benchmark is &quot;not being as successful as NVIDIA&quot;, then yes, a lot of companies are failures.\n\n                    You&#x27;re missing the point - it&#x27;s not about comparing Intel to anyone else, but rather about Intel&#x27;s missed market opportunities. They make processors but missed all the new market opportunities for processors.\n\n                &gt; Pretty sure they&#x27;ve captured as much of the AI&#x2F;ML business as CPUs possibly can.<p>Which is exactly how they missed out on AI&#x2F;ML. CPU is irrelevant in that market.<p>&gt; Because Intel is popular in gaming PCs<p>All gaming consoles use AMD or Nvidia hardware.<p>Gaming PCs use AMD or Nvidia GPUs.\n\n                  &gt;Gaming PCs use AMD or Nvidia GPUs.<p>Any Steam hardware survey (the most relevant for gaming PC contexts) will show Intel handily beating AMD at around 66% to 33% for CPU[1], so your claim that Intel is somehow not popular is bunk.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;hwsurvey&#x2F;processormfg&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;hwsurvey&#x2F;processormfg&#x2F;</a>\n\n                    GPU<p>Note the &quot;G&quot; followed by PU<p>Graphics Processing Unit<p>None of those are GPUs<p>Steam survey PC video card stats show 76.92% Nvidia, 15.09% AMD, and 7.59% Intel (graphics unit integrated with CPU)<p>I never said that Intel CPUs are not popular on gaming PCs. But Intel used to have 99% of that Market.\n\n                      Intel doesn&#x27;t have and has never had a GPU line worth writing home about, so I don&#x27;t know why you would bring up something Intel never had to say Intel is unpopular in gaming PCs.\n\n                        &gt; Intel doesn&#x27;t have and has never had a GPU line worth writing home about<p>That is my point. Emphasizing the earlier statement: &quot;They missed the gaming market&quot;.\n\n                          Your point is bad. Ignoring the fact that Intel&#x27;s bread and butter is the CPU, of which they have a dominant gaming marketshare, is obtuse.\n\n                            They missed the GPU market (AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;Gaming) and the console market. Hence they lost all of that to Nvidia and AMD. Both of those companies now have a bigger market cap than Intel.<p>How is this so difficult to understand? It is very simple, not obtuse, unless you are autistic.<p>Nvidia market cap is $2.26 Trillion.<p>AMD market cap is $290 Billion.<p>Intel market cap is $178 Billion.<p>AMD and Nvidia used to be a tiny fraction of Intel.<p>You guys are getting autistically stuck on this irrelevant detail about CPU popularity in gaming PCs and missing the bigger topic of the discussion. But even in that niche, Intel has lost significant market share to AMD.\n\n                              &quot;Autistic&quot;.  You keep using that word, but I don&#x27;t think it means what you think it means.<p>Are we back in kindergarten, with name calling?\n\n            &gt; would for years have had such a huge opportunity cost, that the shareholders would have sued, and with cause.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering the Intel issue (had family there) and the other post in the thread mention the decade of misses.<p>This actually seems like one of the most reasonable rationales that I don&#x27;t hear mentioned very often.  You might want to do something, yet your hands our tied, because the investors will sue for poor leadership.\n\n              It is the classic innovator&#x27;s dilemma. There are ton of incentives to keep the focus on today&#x27;s cash cow in any business.\n\n            I don&#x27;t think it was that Intel didn&#x27;t have enough capacity to manufacture more. Intel was a manufacturing-first company that beat out &quot;high end&quot; and specialized competitors by economies of scale. Over the long term, the strategy was to build as much high performance silicon as possible.<p>The problem looks like they went down the typical dinosaurification route that their vanquished high end competitors the likes of DEC, Sun, HP, SGI, IBM, etc., which was to switch from manufacturing as much as possible, to protecting high margin x86 parts. Their x86 PC and server organization out-muscled their manufacturing organization (either that or finance did), and so the ended up being very reluctant to adopt GPGPUs or ARM mobile because those were a threat to x86. By the time they realized they&#x27;d missed the boat in those markets, they put out these ridiculous x86 mobile cores and x86 GPGPUs that were costly failures.<p>This pattern of protecting profit margins on high end products while fixed costs every generation increase and performance increases so low end grows up and erodes high end, causing further retreat and protectionism, is exactly what happened with those aforementioned big iron companies. When the bean counters look at the state of things without an understanding of the technology trends, that&#x27;s the logical thing to do, but they paint themselves into this corner.<p>Intel might have just been saved by the bell with Dennard scaling breaking down around the time they were losing their manufacturing advantage. That meant that instead of competitors on a generation or two process lead wiping the floor with them as they did to the minicomputers, it was a much smaller disadvantage and they&#x27;ve been able to somewhat hold on.<p>That&#x27;s my non-insider take on it anyway.\n\n          to your point, right around the time of the iPhone (roughly)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;XScale#Sale_of_PXA_processor_line\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;XScale#Sale_of_PXA_processor_l...</a>\n\n          The same with auto manufacturing: lack of real competition bred complacency and then real competition came along.\n\n        &gt; By not pursuing protectionist public policies.<p>Perhaps. But the more likely correct answer is: The MIC doesn&#x27;t make chips. They couldn&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t push for something that didn&#x27;t deepen their pockets.\n\n      &gt; How did this happen in the first place?<p>Texas Instruments didn&#x27;t give guys like Morris Chang enough opportunities to advance.<p>That&#x27;s why TSMC was founded.\n\n        Similar mistake is being made right now by restricting sales of chips. It forces people to make their own. It is just a matter of time the consequence comes … like many other decisions made by some big wigs before …\n\n          Yes, they have just forced China to make their own chips, and they will make them cheaper and in higher volume than anyone can do...\n\n            Absolutely correct; same for banning any other tech sales to China. I’m not sure it’s terrible policy, though. It’s only speeding up the inevitable a little.\n\n              China isn&#x27;t working for America. Morris Chang was.\n\n      The pentagon is run by politics just like the rest of the country. The US wanted to move industry to other countries, so the Pentagon just played the party like they&#x27;re used to do, and got the promotions and bonuses. Everything else is a second thought.\n\n    While I agree with you I would say that supply chain is upstream of chip-production.<p>The mining industry needed those money not Intel. It&#x27;s the mining industry that&#x27;s been neglected the last 20 years or so.<p>It will take at least 10 years to get anything resembling chinese supply chain in place.\n\n      The chip supply chain is a lot shorter and more concentrated than the mining supply chain. If you&#x27;re thinking of &quot;rare earth&quot; metals in particular, it&#x27;s probably better to focus on the refining rather than digging out of the ground. Between South America, West Africa, and Australia there are lots of mines for most of the metals, but only refining in China (because it has been highly subsidized by both monetary and regulatory means since the 90s). Silicon refining is similarly bottlenecked even though the high quality input material is mostly US sand.\n\n        We HAVE have to focus on the rare earth part or you are basically just giving China the whole thing as they control more then 90% of refinement (and almost all of mining)\n\n        Refining is dirty and dangerous so it has been pushed out.  Used to work for a Canadian gold mine in Montana in the mid 90&#x27;s.  Most of the friends I graduated with went overseas for new mines or were Environmental engineers focused on cleaning up messes from the late 1800&#x27;s early 1900&#x27;s.\n\n          Yeah, lack of regulation is actually a pretty big subsidy for large scale &quot;rare earth&quot; metal refining.\n\n            What&#x27;s a few inland lakes of acid residue toxic metal soup along with tailings piles classified as low level radioactive waste between friends though?<p>These are still being created today, not just as a practice from the 1800&#x27;s.<p>It <i>is</i> the price of technology, better to address these as we progress rather than pushing them out of mind and sight and kicking the can down the road for future generations.\n\n        There&#x27;s substantial wafer capacity in the US, from silane production, through polysilicon granule production and wafer making. There are several different wafer makers in the US with both 200mm and 300mm wafer capacity.<p>Some of the silane and polysilicon companies are US owned, but I don&#x27;t think that any of the wafer makers are US headquartered anymore.\n\n          Isn&#x27;t all high grade silicon derived from one place in the US?\n\n            Spruce Pine - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spruce_Pine_Mining_District\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spruce_Pine_Mining_District</a><p>It&#x27;s the purest source, but lots of cheap PV poly is made from other stuff.\n\n    &gt; under governments who are not close allies.<p>I wonder why...\n\n    What governments that aren&#x27;t your allies?<p>Chips are produced in Taiwan, in Korea, in Japan. In that order. Which of those governments is not allied with the US of A?\n\n      Read carefully :P <i>close</i> allies.  Those allies are <i>far</i> allies.  Sea lanes and supply chain risk is a real thing.\n\n        Is this some kind of joke? So who but Canada is your &#x27;close ally&#x27; then?\n\n          It is a joke but it&#x27;s also true.  The entire Japan South Korea Taiwan situation is at a high risk, if actual conflict breaks out, Taiwan is out, and SK and Japan become trickier <i>on shipping insurance costs alone</i>, assuming they choose not to get involved (they probably will)<p>Obviously Mexico is also a close ally.\n\n            Japan <i>cannot</i> get involved unless the US is directly attacked, their constitution and laws governing use of the JSDF are very explicit in forbidding any use other than defending themselves or the US.<p>If (when?)

I don&#x27;t know that they would, but Taiwan is a huge trading partner and great friend of Japan, in fact Japan&#x27;s closest friend in the whole region.  It&#x27;s quite conceivable that Japan would get involved.\n\n                &gt;Japan can change this on a whim with one meeting of the legislature.

The prime Minister of Japan is actively talking about defending Taiwan if it&#x27;s attacked.  The people of Japan probably won&#x27;t complain.  The US won&#x27;t complain.  South Korea won&#x27;t complain.  And that&#x27;s not even counting a casus belli that might make it justifiable (e.g. some Japanese citizen in Taiwan gets harmed, or chind sends missiles to US based in Okinawa)<p>What exactly do you think is the punitive remedy for Japan breaking clauses in thosd documents in that political scenario?\n\n                    &gt;The people of Japan probably won&#x27;t complain.<p>Again, have some clue about what you&#x27;re talking about first. You are embarrassing yourself.\n\n                    People like him think there&#x27;s some aliens who will come to earth and punish the Japanese if they violate the constitution as it&#x27;s now written.\n\n                &gt; Japan can change this on a whim with one meeting of the legislature.<p>They literally cannot.<p>&gt; You think Japan can&#x27;t change its own laws?<p>It can&#x27;t amend the Constitution just with a vote in the Diet; it requires a supermajority in both Houses <i>followed by</i> a popular referendum.\n\n                  China would attack US bases in Japan and that would trigger whatever needs to be triggered for Japan to enter the war. There’s no way that China would try and invade Taiwan while also not trying to stop the US from intervening.\n\n                    I mean, if we are going to assume “China attacks Taiwan” means “China attacks US bases in Japan” we might ad well assume it means “China preemptively carpets Japan with nukes rendering any Japanese response irrelevant”, but in any case, no one is arguing that Japan would either not react to an actual attack on Japan that left them capable of response or would require Constitutional changes to do so. But “Japan” and “Taiwan” are still different things.\n\n                      Since the US would come to the defense of Taiwan, it would use assets in the region so that includes naval and air assets. The air assets are based in locations such as Guam and Japan (among others). The US would launch sorties from those bases amongst others.<p>Can you think of a scenario in which China would attempt the worlds all-time largest amphibious invasion of Taiwan and then let the US just fly missions and drop in supplies or attack Chinese assets and not respond to the bases themselves? It seems incredibly unlikely to me.<p>There aren&#x27;t any nukes that need to be involved here. Certainly there are potential scenarios in which those do get used, but neither the Chinese nor Americans have any strong desire to escalate a conventional war into a nuclear war. The scenario you are assuming would also include China and the US nuking each other and so that scenario itself is a bit silly whereas China attacking US air bases in the lead up to or during an invasion of Taiwan without escalating to nuclear weapons is a pretty serious scenario.<p>I get your point about Japan not being able to change their constitution so quickly and I don&#x27;t disagree, but I think any scenario in which Taiwan is invaded and the US comes to its defense will drag Japan in to the war sufficiently enough that it will justify whatever it needs to do.\n\n                        &gt;Since the US would come to the defense of Taiwan, it would use assets in the region so that includes naval and air assets.<p>Such use of American forces based in Japan would require consent from the latter, which is not a given.<p>&gt;Article 4 suggests that the United States will consult with Japan in some manner on how it uses the U.S. troops based in Japan.[1]<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Treaty_of_Mutual_Cooperation_and_Security_between_the_United_States_and_Japan\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Treaty_of_Mutual_Cooperation_a...</a>\n\n                          It’s a given in this particular scenario. Otherwise the US  wouldn’t be there.<p>I think it’s a much more probably scenario (however extremely unlikely) that the US would fail to engage if the invasion occurred.\n\n                          The US will never come to the defense of Taiwan.   The US and China will never go to war with each other.  Nuclear powers do not fight each other directly, they do it through proxies, like we are doing with Ukraine vs. Russia.<p>The U.S. might send money and materiel, they might get the U.N. to issue statements, but an actual shooting war between China and America?  Forget it.  It will never happen, because if it did happen, life would not be worth living anywhere on earth for the next 50,000 years.<p>And even sanctions are highly doubtful.  Personally, I really like being able to design a circuit board and get it fabricated and shipped to my front door from China for $25.  And massively interrupting the trade flow between China and the U.S. would lead to a world-wide depression which would make 2008 and the great depression look like boom times.<p>Surely Taiwan knows this, and I suspect that is why TSMC wants to build fabs outside of Taiwan.\n\n                  Laws are just words on paper.  They are irrelevant without people to follow and enforce them.<p>It is very common for Constitutional laws to be suspended in the event of war.  Even without suspension, all it takes is a leader with enough support to ignore the law.\n\n                    Nearly <i>all</i> Prime Ministers and their cabinets in recent history have suffered overall unpopularity and <i>especially so</i> in anything that might even remotely imply the potential for using the JSDF beyond its nameplate purpose.<p>Which is to say, no: No Japanese leader has had the kind of support necessary to ignore the law.\n\n                      A militarily powerful China has also never attacked Taiwan before, so you&#x27;re on sketchy ground asserting a prediction of popular support based on historical precedent.\n\n                  Constitutions can be ignored if everyone wants it so.\n\n      Taiwan is a sacrificial ally. We support them, but don&#x27;t acknowledge them formally.\n\n      &gt; Taiwan<p>The precarious position of Taiwan is the main reason for this.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metaculus.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;11480&#x2F;china-launches-invasion-of-taiwan&#x2F;?sub-question=10880\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metaculus.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;11480&#x2F;china-launches-inv...</a>\n\n  Aren&#x27;t the vast majority of line workers in a fab people with a bachelors degree (or less)? The process engineers might be PhDs, but not most of the folks working in the fabs. Also, fabs are becoming more and more automated, so less people are needed overall.\n\n  Intel became the biggest sponsor of EE H1Bs in this time frame. They were trading competent citizens for compliant serfs.\n\n  IIRC The original chips act had a provision that companies would have to train and hire X% of non-white&#x2F;non-asian engineers.\n\n  It wasn&#x27;t just intel, it was every semi-conductor manufacturer in the valley (hence the inability to find other work).<p>They closed because it was cheaper to build in other countries, or to outsource from contractors who build in other countries (where organized labor doesn&#x27;t exist). The U.S. lost thousands of high-paying (and tax-paying) labor positions and atrophied the skills that went with them. Intel profited from it.<p>These people were disproportionately minorities, disproportionately well-represented by unions, and had made a lot of progress in improving their working conditions re: use of terribly corrosive chemicals. All of that backslid when labor went off-shore.<p>Now, the taxpayer has to pay Intel $8.5B to bring back manufacturing capacity to the U.S.; nice job, if you can get it. It&#x27;ll be really interesting to see who takes these jobs, and how quickly we can rebuild the muscles that Intel shareholders profited from decomposing.\n\n    How long until all those new workers are laid off again as intel goes back to overseas fabs?\n\n      Add the numbers get bigger and the risks increase, the number of &quot;cheap labor&quot; countries where investments in large tech infrastructure are safe is shrinking every year. Maybe South America? Intel has (had?) a fab in Costa Rica...\n\n        South America is very underrated. People still think about the region in 20-30 year old stereotypes, but most countries have gotten much more stable, economics have improved drastically. Workforce is highly educated, different countries share a very similar culture and mostly speak the same language, which means that a lot of things can be scaled much easier. Of course, there&#x27;s also Portuguese, which is still somewhat similar, and Quechuan languages speakers who learn Spanish as a second language, but this doesn&#x27;t change the equation much.<p>The only thing the region lacks is investment and ecosystem to attract and protect it.\n\n          Venezuela&#x27;s perpetual political&#x2F;economic fuck-ups (going on 125 years at this point? [0]), Argentina&#x27;s recurring currency fuck-ups, some really nasty left-wing vs right-wing spats between countries, and a generally weak rule of law &#x2F; judiciary (in comparison with executive branches) deserve mentioning too.<p>South America could stand to learn a <i>LOT</i> from ASEAN -- stability = international investment = economic growth = happy people = stability.<p>In contrast, in South America inveterate bickering about politics dominates and you end up with something like this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:Supranational_American_bodies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:Supranational_Ameri...</a><p>I hope it sorts itself out!

I think it’s either patronising or ignorant to suggest that various Latin American countries policy decisions weren’t made with that in mind.\n\n              It doesn&#x27;t have to be US investment!\n\n    Honestly it blows my mind they were able to give control of one of the most important industries in the world over to a foreign country like that.\n\n      Brain drain is a bitch\n\n      &gt;&gt; Honestly it blows my mind they were able to give control of one of the most important industries in the world over to a foreign country like that.<p>The engines of capitalism only look 1 quarter ahead. And the politicians who support them only look up to the next election. Unless you are majority or largely controlled by your founders, who care about building a good legacy.\n\n        Exactly.  It&#x27;s why authoritarian and&#x2F;or single-party nations have so much more potential to succeed.  It&#x27;s why China did so well for a while.  However, in practice, as we&#x27;ve seen with China and others, authoritarianism only works well when the people at the top are really smart and don&#x27;t have some major character flaws (i.e., the &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;).  Eventually, you get a dictator who&#x27;s a narcissist or moron or fruitcake and it all falls apart.  In that case, the best case is that the inner circle will murder him in his bathtub and select a better leader before he ruins everything.\n\n          Seems to have worked for Russia.\n\n            It has?  Russia has a dictator now who&#x27;s obviously some kind of narcissist, and not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  His hold on power is tenuous at best, and there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;ll be deposed before long.\n\n          You cannot have a dictator who is not a &quot;narcissist or moron or fruitcake&quot; - this is not how human mind works.\n\n            Yes, you certainly can.  It&#x27;s happened many times in history, thanks to hereditary rule (i.e., they inherited these positions, they didn&#x27;t actively seek them).  Queen Elizabeth I of England reigned for 40 years and is considered by historians to be a very good ruler.  Marcus Aurelius of Rome was also considered very good.<p>The problem wasn&#x27;t these rulers, it was what happened after they got old and died and their shitty kids replaced them.\n\n          Benevolent dictator is still just a dictator. As he grows older, he cares more about staying in power than following current trends. China wanted to prevent this with their 10 year rule for the general secretary but Xi changfed that and that was his biggest mistake.\nDemocracy&#x27;s weakness (politicians focusing just on next election cycle) is also its biggest strength. It allows change and adaptation.\n\n            No, a benevolent dictator is the best form of rule.  If he cares more about staying in power than anything else, then he&#x27;s not benevolent.<p>There have been many historical examples of benevolent dictators.  I can&#x27;t think of any in modern history.  Xi certainly isn&#x27;t, and never was.<p>Democracy can avoid the problem of dictatorial systems by allowing the people the ability to get rid of bad rulers, at the expense of usually getting crappy rulers who only focus on the next election cycle, and frequently getting sociopathic narcissists in power.\n\n        Sounds like there is a market opportunity for long term disrupters. We are seeing it on the high end (SpaceX, Tesla) and on the low end a bit (Origin USA). Maybe if you can examine each industry infected by MBAs and see which ones have had enough quality fade caused by their rot to maybe disrupt?\n\n        Market investment is ultimately determined by plausible narrative, and by the national narratives at the broadest level.<p>That is, if your industry is tuned in to the investment climate, the things being pursued match the things that people are saying &quot;will make the country great&quot;, and are backed up by legislation and financing deals.<p>In the previous era, the US was focused on a deindustrializing narrative: the things that made America great were &quot;clean, high-tech&quot; industry, high graduation rates and four-year degrees, and an outsourced empire that brought sprawling supply chains together &quot;just in time&quot;.<p>The new model has brought back the industry, so it needs an emphasis on concrete job skills, versus academic credentialing. It&#x27;s in-sourced so the supply chain has started in on a radical shift. It emphasizes new energy sources with few foreign dependencies, moving the geopolitical stance towards isolation. The approach to the national balance sheet also has to change, but precisely how lacks for consensus.<p>Like with the previous shifts there were some reasons to take the narrative in a certain direction: late 60&#x27;s America had many environmental concerns, and fell into an energy crunch in the next decade. &quot;Smart bombing&quot; the Middle East to secure oil supplies brought together the national industries towards a common goal, and the money supply got a reset early on with the end of Bretton-Woods, that helped propel the Boomer generation towards homes-and-families participation within the system.<p>Today we&#x27;re still putting together the pieces of that narrative, but it&#x27;s central to the political climate: the old two-party system is focused on exhausted narratives that don&#x27;t actually excite ordinary people to vote. Therefore the candidates are rushing to put together platforms that rewrite the script and mobilize new demographics.\n\n        &gt; The engines of capitalism only look 1 quarter ahead.<p>As opposed to what, something like this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_Pests_campaign\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_Pests_campaign</a>?\n\n      That’s the power of slave labour. Global economy is really modern day slavery. When you are making trillions in USD in the USA, paying someone in china $2 a day would’ve been an Egyptian pharaohs dream.\n\n        Calling it slave labour is an insult to the people who had to live with actual slavery.\n\n          The people who flagged this comment must believe that someone working at McDonald&#x27;s for low wages is the same as someone being held as property, their family members terrorized, raped, beaten, whipped, murdered, etc. at the whim of their legal owners.\n\n            &gt; someone being held as property, their family members terrorized, raped, beaten, whipped, murdered, etc. at the whim of their legal owners.<p>Which is coincidentally quite similar to the treatment of North Korean and Chinese penal workers. Russian labor camps are pretty far up there too.<p>Many Foxconn factories have armed guards, but it&#x27;s not to keep people <i>out</i>...\n\n        Yup nowadays we import the product not the slaves.\n\n          &gt;&gt;Yup nowadays we import the product not the slaves.<p>I think you may be undermining what slavery was .<p>I have met folks who work in workshops in India that export stuff to USA and other developed nations. Those workers make a whole lot more money than their neighbors who produce for the domestic market and they have better working conditions. Their overall quality of life, while nowhere close to G8 standards, is so much better. And their community benefits from their increased wages.\n\n        Those &quot;slaves&quot; have generally become quite wealthy. The median wage in Taiwan is close to the UK (it has been higher in the past), and China has moved out of poverty and steadily improving which is a pretty reasonable proxy for all of Asia (India has some catching up to do, but they&#x27;ll get there).<p>This is the same tired argument that was made when the US pushed these jobs off the continent - if the very low wage jobs are allowed exist; eventually enough wealth will be generated that nobody needs to do them. Those sweatshops are in fact a path to prosperity. In some sense it is a cosmic win that all the capital was developed in Asia because they needed it more, but that probably wasn&#x27;t the sort of charity that policymakers intended at the time.\n\n        Calling Taiwanese semiconductor workers “slave labor” may be the funniest take I’ve seen all week. Have you <i>been</i> to Taiwan??\n\n      It&#x27;s amazing to me the number of people ranting at each other about this, when it seems like straight up BS. Intel&#x27;s current and past manufacturing sites are <i>not</i> in low cost of living locations: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Intel_manufacturing_sites\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Intel_manufacturing_si...</a> There are two exceptions: one in China, one in Malaysia, but that is two out of dozens in the US&#x2F;EU&#x2F;Israel.\n\n        And even then, Malaysia has a bigger GDP PPP per capita than Chile, Bulgaria, Uruguay, and only slightly behind Greece! Quite a bit above Mexico too! They aren&#x27;t a low-cost country.\n\n    &gt; nice job, if you can get it<p>TSMC is paying around $23&#x2F;hour to manufacturing technicians in Arizona. They’re also sending people to Taiwan to get trained and apparently it’s brutal enough that most people drop out of the program.<p>Asianometry did a video on this recently: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Nk-lBok9_TU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Nk-lBok9_TU</a>\n\n      Yikes. I think my local Dunkin’ Donuts is paying $16+.\n\n      i&#x27;ve done better than $23&#x2F;h making pizza\n\n        I just hope you don&#x27;t loose your love for pizza.\n\n          Or lose your pizza making wages to wafer makers applying their wafer making skills to pizza making.\n\n            they already have that, it&#x27;s called dominoes. there&#x27;s still a market for tattooed freaks with culinary opinions throwing dough and poking a fire with a stick\n\n          my love for pizza is surprisingly resilient, and the job was athletic enough to generate a healthy appetite.<p>but yeah, most of my coworkers had a hard time doing it sober\n\n        You may not have been making pizza where the $23&#x2F;hr employees were spending their money.<p>Plus, they can only eat so much pizza. Having more of them switching to pizza making would not necessarily raise their wages, i.e. a glut of pizza makers should depress pizza making wages.\n\n      I wonder how the much the pass rate might improve if pay were higher.\n\n      You can do better than that flinging burgers at Dicks here in Seattle.<p>That’s wild. For something that requires a trip to Taiwan for training, which I imagine makes it not an easy job, why does it pay so little? I’d think retention would be important if the training is that intensive.\n\n        It&#x27;s because in Taiwan that&#x27;s standard compensation for this field, and for that specific project it&#x27;s TSMC. They don&#x27;t want to pay US rates if they can avoid it, and it&#x27;s possible that their company would be unprofitable if they had to.\n\n          &gt; They don&#x27;t want to pay US rates if they can avoid it, and it&#x27;s possible that their company would be unprofitable if they had to.<p>Ha, ha, ha.  No.<p>Let&#x27;s see, from Wikipedia. 2022 data:<p>- Number of employees: 73,090<p>- Net income: US$27.67 billion<p>Which gives us: 27.67e9&#x2F;73090  = 369,407.57<p>So, just looking at their net income (which already takes into account the salary costs of said employees), they could afford to pay every employee US $370,000 a year before being unprofitable.<p>Between US $50,000 and US $370,000 there is quite some margin for improvement. And clearly, the low wages they pay have nothing to do with the risk of being unprofitable.\n\n            Semiconductor manufacturing is very capital intensive so running the company as a nonprofit is a nonstarter.<p>You&#x27;ve presented historical data to counter the of argument that wage&#x2F;salary growth MAY lead to potential unprofitability solely on the basis of one year&#x27;s profit numbers. That&#x27;s literally driving forward looking in the rearview mirror because it says very little about how profitable the company would be if it raised wages&#x2F;salaries. At best it may be a first order approximation of how profitable the company would have been in 2022, if it paid people more then. However, even for 2022 the calculation isn&#x27;t as simple as dividing the profit by the number of employees and keeping the company profitable.\n\n              Ok then perhaps offer a better approximation, let&#x27;s say 50% of profit instead of the 100% share. That is still a very decent wage and is on top of the existing labour expense which profit has already accounted for\n\n                Companies have absolutely non incentive to do this. TMSC turned that profit in 2022 with wages as-is, why would they spend more on wages if they don&#x27;t need to?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wish companies were incentivized to do right by their employees. That&#x27;s just not how the world works, companies only need to do the bare minimum to get the job done and leave as much profit on the table as possible.\n\n                Problems with that are things like:<p>- what if the EU writes a rule and then fines you for breaking it as a percentage of revenue? You can&#x27;t have no money available for the future. You need a huge amount of money available for the future, as otherwise a company that pays its workers less (but still retains them) will beat you eventually<p>- why would anyone invest in you for the chance of no return? It&#x27;s a high risk strategy to put $1m on a number in roulette for the chance of making a fortune; it&#x27;s a ridiculous one to put $1m on a number in roulette for the chance of getting your money back\n\n              Hiding behind &quot;it&#x27;s complicated&quot; is an over-used excuse to avoid a more critical look at a problem.<p>A one year point is a crude approximation, but it does illustrate the order of magnitude mismatch between what they could pay their employees vs what they actually pay them, which was the short point being made.<p>More broadly, TSMC had no problem shelling out $9.9 billion to shareholders that same year (or $123,000+ per employee).  So the argument of saving every penny because of the &quot;capital intensive&quot; nature of their business is also out the door.<p>And complaining about a single year estimate in the case of TSMC is barking up the wrong tree.  They&#x27;ve had net incomes in the billions at least since the beginning of the 2000s.<p>So no, in the case of TSMC, they have no reason to pay wages below what is considered a &quot;living wage&quot; in Phoenix, Arizona.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingwage.mit.edu&#x2F;metros&#x2F;38060\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingwage.mit.edu&#x2F;metros&#x2F;38060</a>\n\n                Then TSMC would be paying its Taiwan employees a lot less, the disparity could be a problem somehow.\n\n                Our markets, not even remotely isolated to semiconductor, are saturated in these bloated old businesses that are running on the razor&#x27;s edge of financial ruin, yet every quarter are paying out catastrophic amounts of money in stock buybacks and generous compensation packages for the executives running them into the ground. It&#x27;s beyond fucking parody at this point.<p>Also I wonder what the excuses will be once all the underdeveloped nations do what China did and actually develop. We have a finite number of exploitable countries on the planet with workers willing to work for pennies to assemble products. At SOME POINT this party is going to end, it has to.\n\n                  The effect of globalization is that the west is bringing the rest of the world over the poverty line at the cost of deteriorating ourselves. Hard to say how this will end.\n\n                What&#x27;s the EPS? Is the business doing better than the market?<p>When you open your business you&#x27;re free to pay all your capital to your staff.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever changed banks or cards to get a better interest rate you deeply understand but haven&#x27;t surfaced it here\n\n              Very capital intensive means operating costs (wages) are a small percentage.<p>A trailing fab has very few people running the operation. This will be a trailing fab.\n\n      As a tangential point of comparison $23 per hour is a common rate for nannies&#x2F;baby sitters in Atlanta Georgia without a degree or development certificate. One we use is a former teacher who disliked the work.\n\n    It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t just the semi-conductor manufacturers either.<p>The PRC had the supply chain from the bottom up (to some extent funded by the western consumers and corporations), whereas the US is trying to get reindustrializd from the top down, without first building a solid fundamental. To make the tough jobs easy, you must have the easy jobs done well first.\n\n      Exactly. That&#x27;s why this has everything to go wrong. You cannot create the talent and the supply chain needed for this with $8B. The US needs to solve much more fundamental things like their schools and the local supply chain to even have a shot of creating a successful chip business again.\n\n        Recall, it takes years to build these fabs.  Fortunately, people will be more likely to spend years in grad school training for these jobs, if they know that when they graduate there will be fabs to hire them.<p>Rebuilding is a chicken and egg problem, but it’s not as hard as defeating the axis powers in WWII.  If this country has the Will to do something, it’s gunna get done.\n\n          This is harder than defeating an enemy militarily. Defeating someone militarily is relatively simple to do; and every country figures it out from necessity. It is an expensive process, but ultimately mainly about deciding that the high price is worth it (and if the country can afford it&#x2F;has the industrial base to sustain the effort, but neither of those things can be changed in a conflict).<p>Building a profitable industrial chain is significantly harder to do and much rarer to achieve. The US certainly has the people to do it, but it isn&#x27;t clear that the political trade-offs will be acceptable.\n\n            Also remember that the US was at the top of its industrial power during second WW. This time has passed long since. Nowadays it would have a hard time outproducing China and Russia, so I don&#x27;t think that even a world war would be a solution (not considering the fact that a new WW could be the end of the world itself).\n\n    &gt;They closed because it was cheaper to build in other countries, or to outsource from contractors who build in other countries (where organized labor doesn&#x27;t exist). The U.S. lost thousands of high-paying (and tax-paying) labor positions and atrophied the skills that went with them. Intel profited from it.<p>How about asking the workers in other countries who benefitted from this transaction if they were happy with the arrangement?  Or do only Americans matter?  Maybe you think foreigners are fit only to till dirt fields as subsistence farmers?\n\n      In many of the countries with cheap labor the ones who profit the most are not the workers as you try to imagine this nice idea )))\n\n      There&#x27;s a certain irony in the point being made by that person because they think it means organized labor is good, and lack of it is cheap and bad.<p>Those workers could get the job done just the same without the overhead of labor unions, and this person still thinks that the &#x27;cheapness&#x27; means that organized labor is magically better.<p>You won&#x27;t get an earnest answer though. Perhaps some nonsense about how these workers would be <i>even better off</i> with organized labor (until their jobs move to the next, cheaper bidder, of course).\n\n      &gt; How about asking the workers in other countries who benefitted from this transaction if they were happy with the arrangement?<p>I&#x27;m sure they were happy with the arrangement, they benefitted from it in the short-term. You should speak with Foxconn workers today, though. The story is more nuanced.<p>&gt; Do only Americans matter?<p>This is a weird claim to bestow on my original post.<p>Labor conditions matter. The balance of power of power and profits between labor and capital matters.<p>I promise you, semiconductors did not move production to ${foreign_country} out of the goodness of their hearts, to better the living conditions of ${foreign_country}&#x27;s impoverished underclasses.<p>They did it because the balance of power (and profits) had shifted towards labor in this country in the 40s, 50s and 60s, and the population of ${foreign_country} was cheaper to exploit.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out (again) that a disproportionate of people in manufacturing in California semiconductor industry were 0th or 1st generation immigrants (from the Philippines, Mexico, China and so on) or internal refugees from the Jim Crow South who migrated to California for military work during WW II. These were people who were literally at most 1 generation removed from subsistence farming.<p>&gt; Maybe you think foreigners are fit only to till dirt fields as subsistence farmers?<p>Again, a weird claim to stick me with.<p><i>Humans</i> working in manufacturing should be free to negotiate living wages, safe and healthy working conditions, reasonable time off and retirement policies, illness&#x2F;disability insurance, and so on.<p>The reason U.S. companies prefer &quot;foreigners&quot; (domestically and abroad) is not because foreigners don&#x27;t deserve these things as much as any other person, it&#x27;s because they know they can get away with exploiting them for a few decades before they develop class consciousness.<p>In the last few years, workers in China have been striking to demand what workers in California fought hard for 70-80 years ago.<p>Entirely coincidentally, Foxconn began &quot;diversifying&quot; its manufacturing capacity into India and other countries. Do you think it&#x27;s because they want to help uplift people from subsistence farming? :)\n\n    &gt; They closed because it was cheaper to build in other countries, or to outsource from contractors who build in other countries (where organized labor doesn&#x27;t exist). The U.S. lost thousands of high-paying (and tax-paying) labor positions and atrophied the skills that went with them. Intel profited from it.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense, Intel did and still does most of its manufacturing in the US, didn&#x27;t it? (See: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Intel_manufacturing_sites\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Intel_manufacturing_si...</a>) I assume the thing that changed if there was a major loss of jobs was automation, not outsourcing. It&#x27;s a lot easier to keep a clean room clean if you don&#x27;t need to let people (with their hair and dead skin particles) in.\n\n      Their DoD and Dod-adjacent business (read: high-nanometer) processes are largely in the U.S.<p>Their consumer and server business (read: low-nm) processes are largely international.<p>The wikipedia page you linked evinces this statement.<p>The phrase &quot;most of its manufacturing&quot; is a Simpson&#x27;s Paradox statement. It&#x27;s true, but not in a way that&#x27;s interesting. High-nanometer processes are easier to automate.\n\n        <i>All</i> of the &quot;low-nm&quot; process fabs on that wiki page are in the US (with one in Ireland).\n\n          I went down a bit of a rabbit hole to try and find manufacturing stats per fab, and it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find.<p>First, it&#x27;s worth noting that most of the &lt;300nm fabs in the U.S. are really new. The Oregon facility was historically the most relevant fab, Arizona seems to be (potentially?) supplanting it from a design and capacity POV.<p>But the Israeli fab really shouldn&#x27;t be discounted, they employ 12k people in Israel. I can&#x27;t find numbers on production output, but that headcount is a similar OOM to the Oregon plant. Most of their successful, recent designs came from Israel, too. The Ireland fab employs 4.5k people. There&#x27;s 22k in Oregon, unclear on the breakdown of manufacturing and R&amp;D&#x2F;non-manufacturing roles.<p>As I understand it from said rabbit hole, they do a lot of design and &quot;proofing&quot; manufacturing of low-nm processes in Oregon, but rely on Ireland and Israel to scale-up.<p>It seems that the recent (i.e. post-9&#x2F;11) Arizona plants are more geared towards high-volume production. Regardless of what calculations went into those decisions, they&#x27;re a hedge against political instability in Israel.\n\n    &gt; Now, the taxpayer has to pay Intel $8.5B to bring back manufacturing capacity to the U.S<p>The tax payer had nothing to do with it. This is yet another example of the government taking our money (or borrowing our future money) and spending it in ways that we never agreed to and had no input on.\n\n      &gt; <i>in ways that we never agreed to and had no input on.</i><p>You don&#x27;t vote in local, congressional, and presidential elections?\n\n        If this is Biden&#x27;s initiative, then the alternative is Trump? I&#x27;m sure there could be a technocratic rational non-idealogical third party that would get a bunch of HN voters but does any viable third party actually exist?<p>Fixing our education system is a lot bigger problem then we&#x27;ve ever been able to tackle as a country by popular initiatives.\n\n          The fact that Trump and Biden are the two candidates we&#x27;ve been offered is a sign of a much more fundamental, and disappointing, problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would agree that those two are the best candidates this country has to offer, and most people I&#x27;ve talked to about the election feel stuck picking between which one is less bad.\n\n        Find me a candidate that had any input on this Intel investment that campaigned on giving billions to Intel to onshore chip manufacturing.<p>Maybe they do exist, but I don&#x27;t remember it coming up.<p>Also to clarify, local elections wouldn&#x27;t have helped here. Congressional and presidential elections are a different beast, The Machine (reference to the University of Alabama) heavily influences elections and elected officials. I do vote, but I have little faith that such a massive and heavily funded political system allows my vote to count for more than winning a seat. I&#x27;ve been regularly disappointed by those I&#x27;ve voted for when they inevitably ignore or break promises they campaigned on and make decisions that often fly in the face of the very principles they originally claimed to stand for.\n\n      You sound like you’re agreeing with the statement. What is your syntactic point here? That the taxpayer has nothing to do with the decision making is irrelevant the point you responded to. They still pay for it.\n\n        Technically we haven&#x27;t paid for new spending in tax dollars since Clinton was in the White House, its hard to say taxes pay for something when its paid for with debt.<p>That said, my point was that the tax payer isn&#x27;t really paying for it when the tax payer has no say in what is being paid for. If the taxes are collected either under false pretense, or no pretense at all, for what the money will be spent on then the citizen is only responsible for paying the tax bill. The money is the government&#x27;s at that point, and responsibility for how it is spent at that point stops at their desks.<p>If the tax payer were truly the one paying for this, we would at minimum have a voice in the program. At best, the government would propose the plan and leave it up to the tax payers to fund it in almost a kick starter type of approach. A simple vote would make more sense IMO, but if we are to pay for it with tax dollars and the government refuses to run a surplus, tax payers (should) have to kick in more money to pay for it.\n\n          Acknowledging the complexity inherent in how the U.S. gov&#x27;t finances initiatives.<p>However, <i>eventually</i>, the buck stops at the taxpayer.<p>Yes, the federal gov&#x27;t issues bonds to finance their activities (i.e. deficit spending), but the creditworthiness of the U.S. is intrinsically supported by the federal government&#x27;s capacity to collect taxes from its citizens.<p>Eventually, &quot;we the people&quot; foots the bill. It might be amortized over decades and deferred more years still, but it&#x27;s still a debit to &quot;we the people&quot; of $8.5B in the ledger.\n\n            I&#x27;m honestly not sure if that is the case anymore. With a purely fiat system we really can&#x27;t afford to pay off the debt, doing so would remove money from the money supply and could lead to an economic contraction.<p>I&#x27;m no sure what would happen economically if we paid off federal debt in any meaningful amount. I&#x27;d be really curious if you have any insights into what that would look like.\n\n              I do think we can pay off the debt. It would require an increase in taxation that would cause an S&amp;P 500 contraction.<p>When it comes down to it, it&#x27;ll be a political choice between cutting Social Security benefits (absolutely no way this happens) and a highly progressive tax on the country&#x27;s wealthy.<p>I don&#x27;t think the first one is going to happen, and our two party system is so totally dominated by the country&#x27;s wealthy population that we&#x27;ll never even see a vote on the second during peacetime.<p>One route is to &quot;grow&quot; our way out of debt, and those hopes are pinned on some blend of nuclear fusion and &quot;AI, AI, smth smth, AI&quot;.<p>Failing that strategy, I think that spiraling U.S. debt is one of the features that greases the slide towards WW III. :&#x2F;<p>Last time around, we needed WW II to rebalance power between asset owners and renters in this country – it literally required a global, existential struggle to get wealthy people to pay taxes. I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;re on the same track today.\n\n                &gt; I do think we can pay off the debt. It would require an increase \n&gt; in taxation that would cause an S&amp;P 500 contraction.<p>I was very worried about the huge deficits from the Reagan era.  But when Clinton was elected, and he raised taxes, I thought we were done for.<p>Surely, raising taxes would cause the economy to contract more, which would lead to even less government revenue, a higher deficit, ever more impossible to service, etc etc....<p>Well.  Imagine my surprise a few years later when the deficits turned into surpluses.<p>What I had forgotten to take into account is that raising taxes causes the interest rates to go down--if the government isn&#x27;t borrowing billions and trillions of dollars, i.e., if the demand for debt goes down, the price of debt (i.e. the interest rate) also goes down.<p>So an upper middle-class guy may have gotten his taxes raised by a few thousand dollars--but he just refinanced his mortgage from 10% to 5% and saved a thousand dollars a month.  (Yes, interest rates for mortgages were that high, and higher.  My Dad bought a house at $14% interest rate in the 80&#x27;s).<p>I remember reading an article in the Wall Street Journal by a guy who was scared to death of the surpluses--in a few decades, he said, we&#x27;ll no longer have any 30-year government bonds.  How will Fannie May and Freddie Mac be able to subsidize 30-year mortgages?  How are we going to use Black-Scholes to calculate the correct value of derivatives if we don&#x27;t have a measure of the zero-risk interest rate??<p>Alas, the supreme court threw away Gore, and installed Bush as president, where he solved those &quot;problems&quot; in very short order.\n\n                  I think one part that’s missing from this narrative that’s otherwise solid is that the Clinton administration raised taxes while simultaneously expanding globalization (NAFTA, expanded ties with China).<p>Nowadays, we’d be raising taxes while globalization is contracting. On-shoring is inflationary, because the same goods as before cost more.<p>Raising taxes in an inflationary environment is scarier than raising taxes in a deflationary environment.\n\n                    &gt; Raising taxes in an inflationary environment is scarier than raising taxes in a deflationary environment.<p>I know it can be scary, but, we are going to have to muster the courage to try unorthodox things--like actually paying the bills.  Raising taxes in an inflationary environment can be a very beneficial move.  Why? Higher taxes reduce demand, which helps fight inflation.<p>This takes some pressure off of the Fed.  The Federal Reserve only has a very few policy tools to control inflation or to stimulate the economy:  basically they can either rase rates or lower rates.<p>But if inflation is being controlled by increased taxes, the Fed doesn&#x27;t have to raise interest rates as much--or even at all--to control inflation.<p>And a lower interest rate means that companies can afford invest in things which will increase profits and will raise the productivity of its workers.  Which fights inflation.<p>In addition, higher taxes means lower deficits, which means the government isn&#x27;t hoovering up all the money available for investment.  It will issue fewer bonds, and people who would have bought those bonds will have to start investing their money in actual productive businesses.  Which also helps inflation.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be a doom spiral--we can spiral up if we just stop buying into the notion that we can get out of this if only we make the deficit large enough.\n\n                      I mean I totally agree with you, I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s political willpower to swallow the pill and actually pass legislation that would increase taxes.<p>Because, all else equal, capital owners (who set the policy agenda in Congress) would prefer to keep their wealth continue rolling the dice until they can&#x27;t anymore.\n\n                        Its easy to forget--but <i>we</i> are the many;  <i>they</i> are the few.  And Trump hasn&#x27;t quite succeeded in rendering our votes moot.  Capital owners can only control congress by persuading us that we should let them.<p>I believe its a very good thing that we have billionaires--look at what China&#x27;s economy did once they let some people become billionaires.  But in China or anywhere else, there are only billionaires because we believe that their existence benefits us--that we are <i>better off</i> if there are billionaires around.<p>If it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> benefit us to have them around, eventually we will all figure that out and change things so that once again they do benefit us.\n\n  Well, I was there in the late 90&#x27;s and don&#x27;t recall that anecdote. Most of the people in the fab shuttle the lots from station to station. Some even look at porn and get high while waiting (that&#x27;s my anecdote, clean room alarms went bananas when he lit up). And robots that zip around the ceiling and drop down in dangerous areas do the rest.<p>Mind citing your anecdote? I realize I wasn&#x27;t in every fab, but it&#x27;s not rocket science, even on 300mm and beyond.\n\n    <i>chuckle</i> Asking for further justification is always fair play, and I don&#x27;t mind being checked....but I&#x27;m kind of a loss as to what to cite.  It wasn&#x27;t something I read in a book, it was lived experience.<p>But, I mean when you say:<p>&gt; clean room alarms went bananas when he lit up<p>you might have answered your own question...that stuff may have flied when we were at 180 nanometers, but lets face it, there&#x27;s only so far down the road of Moore&#x27;s law you can travel with people who smoke in a clean room...\n\n      Just show me where PhDs are needed to wheel a batch of wafers from the litho room to the bath. I&#x27;ll wait.\n\n        If you think that is the bulk of what people in fabs do, well… obviously you aren’t a golfer.\n\n          There&#x27;s thousands of people working at D1X. They are not all PhDs. Your initial post is just some made up BS polluting hacker news. I really like this site, but if you want points for storytelling, go to slashdot or reddit.\n\n  You should hire the very smart people to figure out how to make the jobs doable for average people. Surely there must be a way to configure line work to not require a PhD...\n\n    Anything which doesn&#x27;t require a Ph.D. in solid-state physics to do must be automated, because only machines can handle&#x2F;manipulate&#x2F;transport the wafers with enough precision not to damage them.\n\n  &gt;Intel had to fire most line workers in their FABS, and hire people with Ph.D.&#x27;s in solid-state physics<p>Why did Intel HAVE to fire most line workers and hire Ph.Ds?\n\n    Well, even back in my grandfather&#x27;s day (he was a millwright for Ford) working on\nthe line required more mental skills than most people realized.  Remember when Elon Musk finally gave up trying to 100% automate his factories?  He said &quot;we undervalued the abilities of humans.&quot;<p>If manufacturing cars is so complex you can&#x27;t train monkeys, or build robots, to do it, how much harder must it be to make chips?<p>Making things that small, that precisely, repeatably, profitably, by the millions and billions, is <i>spectacularly</i> complex.  And with each process node, the complexity grows even faster than Moore&#x27;s law does.<p>Eventually, it gets to the point that even to tell somebody how to do something, you need to do it using the language of advanced physics, the kind of physics which requires you to spend studying 60-80 hours a week, for 5-7 years in grad school to learn.  As the gen-X proverb goes, reality bites.\n\n  Hardware people get boned.<p>I worked at a non-semiconductor tenant company in a semiconductor research campus&#x2F;facility.<p>Parking lots tell the story. There was a pecking order for the lots, which made it easy to classify. The best off working people were the trades guys. The plumbers and electricians were high-skilled and well paid. Like guys commuting 2,000 miles and buying a second $90k F-250 to drive around town in.<p>The bigshots were Teslas, BMWs, big SUVs. There were a few corvettes and a Ferrari.<p>The Fab engineers and workers were all driving old Hondas and Hyundais.<p>One of my good friends from high school was a mechanical engineer at IBM and a master at some super-critical process for mainframes. They moved to a different architecture and his entire team was just nuked from orbit before they even knew what was happening. He was selling real estate for awhile and eventually got back into engineering.\n\n    I don&#x27;t think you can draw conclusions from that, considering you have absolutely no idea who is in massive debt for those vehicles. Especially with tradesfolk because the vehicle is a business expense.\n\n      People making good money tend to not, as a cohort, drive 8 year old cheap cars.<p>And of course ymmv between companies, regions, facilities or projects. There are software people trapped maintaining stupid legacy insurance code and similar dreck too.\n\n    I work at a hardware company.  Our parking lot looks like a Tesla, Rivian and Mazarati dealership.\n\n  There&#x27;s something off in this thread, which seems to posit that all of this is about Intel moving fab capacity back to the US and away from unreliable places.<p>That is clearly not the reality: according to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Intel_manufacturing_sites\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Intel_manufacturing_si...</a>, 16 of 23 of Intel&#x27;s fabs are in the US and 6 of the other 7 are in close allies (Ireland, Israel, Germany).<p>There may be something to be said about what&#x27;s happened to the rest of the US fab industry, though.\n\nTitle on commerce.gov isn&#x27;t quite what the first sentence says, which is they announced a _proposal_, not a done deal.<p>U.S. Department of Commerce Proposes up to $8.5 Billion in Potential Direct Funding for Intel Under President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda to Support Multiple Projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon\n\nOh good, another bunch of board members can now afford their yacht club memberships for 2024.<p>These handouts need to stop.\n\n  The alternative is to be dependent on the rest of the world for chips.<p>The market decided that the most efficient transaction is to offshore all of this infrastructure to geopolitically-compromised areas and pray that China never does what every other emerging power in the history of geopolitics has done.<p>The market chose wrong.\n\n    &gt; pray that China never does what every other emerging power in the history of geopolitics has done.<p>I am curious what you mean by this precisely. What other emerging powers have done what?\n\n      They throw their weight around to influence geopolitics.<p>EDIT: \nThere really does seem to have been this mindset in the 80s and 90s regarding China that they were going to liberalize once we shipped them a bunch of our industry and IP. You can only really believe that would happen if two things are true:<p>1) You have a woeful misunderstanding of Chinese politics<p>2) You think that the West, and the US in particular, have some sort of magic that will invariably keep us ahead of the Chinese. Maybe it was racism, maybe it was underestimating the power of collectivism, but there were people who really saw China as nothing more than a workforce that would happily do whatever Western companies wanted them to do, while providing absolutely no competition, forever and ever.\n\n    The market chose what it could based on the conditions that exist. Make is easier to people to open new businesses and expand existing ones, and people will do so. Creating hostile environments and then choosing who gets free money to overcome those difficulties is not much of a market.\n\n    The actual alternative would be to publicly admit the failure of very loosely regulated free markets and regulate the chip industry instead, but apparently the charade must be kept alive at all costs (to the taxpayers).<p>&gt; The market chose wrong.<p>Oh no, the market chose right, but what the &quot;market&quot; wants doesn&#x27;t align with what the nation requires.\n\n  Gelsinger is a weird dude. He had the Pope bless a wafer for good luck on a fab.\n\nMore discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39764821\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39764821</a>\n\nCapitalism 101, get tax payer money to fund your big projects!\n\nNow all they have to do is compete with TSM, which is widely known to be a very simple thing.\n\n&gt; The Biden administration, equipped with $39 billion in subsidies to distribute,<p>IMO this is the major problem in American politics (maybe world too)- That we have the government picking and choosing winners before the game is even played.<p>IMO we should be rewarding the winners in a after a fair game with rules tailored to what we want to incentivize. Eg: A per chip, per TFLOP or other intelligent metric reward AFTER the item is produced and sold on the free market. IMO The government should not be financing or changing the capital structure of any corporation, instead investors should take the risk and use financial structures available to chase the rewards.\n\n  &gt; “fair game” : are you certain tsmc has not received handouts from their government\n\n    I&#x27;m not.<p>But what I&#x27;m referring to here is the goal of having American produced chips. If TMSC wants to produce in America, and a foreign government wants to foot the bill, then what would be the issue?\n\n  This was happening all the time in semiconductor industry<p>consider reading Chip War\n\nOften politics and fine print gets in the way.  It’s hard to find qualified talented people to build and run a fab  Now imagine all the DEI requirements that are added into this grant.<p>If it is really a national security issue to get onshore fans here in the US they really need to drop all the social equity attachments.\n\nMy employer spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Intel hardware for a major system, and it still hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day due to complete incompetence on Intel&#x27;s part. I look forward to seeing how they mismanage this money.\n\nI said this about China trying to make chip investments but it applies to the US too. It’s extremely difficult for government to pick who should be winners with investments like this, and then the question of what is next, x-ray lithography, photonics or something else. I suppose this is quite far into the future and a moot point as the AGI will have moved the humans into a simulation by then to avoid any problems with them.\n\nI&#x27;m a foreigner native to one of the many nations where American influence led to the sale of sate enterprises, free trade, market liberalization, and overall loss of local companies to the hands of USA firms<p>It&#x27;s wild to see the same thing happen to the USA now, and to see their government be the ones handing out taxpayer money and caring about national sovereignty over liberalization and &quot;market efficiency&quot;.\n\n  It&#x27;s been happening for decades in other industries. Especially automotive. Same (worse) here in Canada.<p>To me it&#x27;s a sign of a sector in decline.\n\n  As a US citizen, it&#x27;s pretty wild to live through. Socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the rest of us.\n\n    Unfortunately no, it&#x27;s socialism for us too - just the wrong end of it. The government and their friends are the socialism winners, the rest of us are the socialism losers.<p>But we do it to ourselves at the ballot box every time, and very reliably.\n\n      I don&#x27;t know what the heck you are talking about. Socialism is not the kind of bs like capitalism or communism, it has no winners nor losers everyone is in the same boat.<p>Anything else is just some crooked politicians, could be billionaires but don&#x27;t have to, getting more rich and powerful and say whatever they have to say to keep it this way.\n\n        I don&#x27;t see how socialism is any different. It is still the state taking from one person to give to another.<p>How is anyone in the same boat with Socialism? Unless your metaphor is that some paddle and some don&#x27;t, but everyone goes the same speed\n\n          &gt;I don&#x27;t see how socialism is any different. It is still the state taking from one person to give to another.<p>Socialism is when workplaces are owned and managed by the people who work there, rather than private investors. It has nothing to do with taxes, or welfare, or &quot;the state&quot; doing one thing or another -- that is a uniquely American conflation.\n\n            AI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate. State Socialism is real.\n\n      These things are all done in the name of national security… feels like lots of fluff… politicians’ way to get us tax payers to fund their friends …\n\n  Consider reading Chip War then\n\n  Unfortunately a lot of that influence was done with the exact purpose of handing the markets to the US companies. I am not anti market and there are definitely good arguments in its favor (e.g. a  better cheaper product even if imported will allow you to invest the money in something else) but it&#x27;s a delicate topic and in reality almost no country operates like this.<p>Also even free market proponents draw the line somewhere. They will always advocate privatising healthcare but never the police or the army. Somehow it&#x27;s important that keeping people healthy is economical and efficient, but not upholding the law.\n\nThis is such a horrible approach to succeeding and will not do anything good for anyone.<p>Those factories will be mostly automated and so the idea that they will come with lots of jobs is misguided. On top of that to the extent this is a good idea the private market have no problem finding the money for that themselves.<p>The real issue is in the actual materials i.e. rare earth etc which is where the government completely dropped the ball the last 20 years.<p>8.5B going to the mining industry would make sense not to Intel.\n\n$8.5 in corporate welfare, out of a total of $39B that &quot;Biden has to spend.&quot; - That&#x27;s about $100 per person in the US. How about just give us each $100 instead, and we can vote with those Dollars for what we want? Maybe we&#x27;d rather invest it in food, clothes, shelter, transportation, etc.\n\n  I suppose at least the theory is $100&#x2F;person invested in chips will collectively benefit us more as we will not lose the strategic advantage in chipmaking. Surgical planned economy to cover the gaps in market economy and tragedy of the commons situations.\n\n    planned economies only enrich the planners\n\n      Strictly speaking that is manifestly false (the &quot;only&quot; part).  At the very least, in practice they usually enable a bunch of unnatural markets&#x2F;behaviors (usually falling under &quot;corruption&quot;) that enrich many ancillary parties in addition to the planners, even if they don&#x27;t enrich the general population (last I checked the west was filled with plenty of Marxist-adjacents who make arguments of such sort, so I suppose it it is not a given for everyone). To be clear, I am not advocating for the grant per se; just describing a theory the other side might be operating under.\n\nSomething about giving a multibillion dollar company government grants rubs me the wrong way.<p>Most of the money probably goes into hiring useless consulting firms to “do the leg work”.\n\n  Nah, this is intel. They&#x27;ll spend it on a dividend.\n\n    Dividends don&#x27;t make you any money because the rest of the passive-aggressive investors downvote the stock price by exactly the dividend amount when dividends are given.<p>If everyone agreed to maintain the stock price when dividends were issued, the dividends would be useful.\n\n      <i>the rest of the passive-aggressive investors downvote the stock price by exactly the dividend amount when dividends are given</i><p>This is the expected result if markets are correctly pricing stocks. The value of a company is its assets plus its future income streams. When a company pays a dividend, its cash assets decrease, so the value of its stock should decrease by that same amount.\n\n        I don&#x27;t know what to make of all these strange objections to completely normal and rational business processes. People describe them as if they are somehow a bad thing.<p>The only thing your description is missing is that while the total market cap goes down, the individual share price should go up because the number of outstanding shares is smaller. This is how the company transfers value to the shareholder that has not sold their stock.\n\n        But that way dividends are useless though.<p>I&#x27;d much rather dividends be issued on random dates to random shareholders so that the market cannot predict when they happen, just a bunch of random people anonymously get dividends deposited each time, and as long as you stay invested for a long time you get dividends at the same average rate as everyone else.\n\n      The same thing happens with a stock buyback.  The value of the company (in theory) decreases by the amount of cash distributed.\n\n    More likely a stock buyback.\n\n  Its a faction of the money you&#x27;ll spend defending East China from reunification.<p>&#x2F;s&#x2F;s&#x2F;s&#x2F;&#x2F;s&#x2F;s&#x2F;s&#x2F;s (because a lot of you struggle)\n\nCall me hopeful and sceptical that you can do this in the USA. The employees are just ganna flip jobs\n\nIt&#x27;s frustrating that Intel is being given truckloads of taxpayer money after spending decades falling behind their competitors due to arrogance and complacency.\n\nI hope these have stringent, result based conditions applied to them.\n\n  There&#x27;s one condition in particular that I think should absolutely be part of this: a requirement that Intel offers foundry services on an ongoing basis and giving equivalent access and prices to foundry customers as they give to their own internal customers.<p>Foundry services are a small part of Intel&#x27;s business currently, but in the event TSMC is disrupted then Intel would have a near-monopoly on high-end chip manufacturing.  Whether Intel is obligated to work with Nvidia, Apple, AMD, etc... could make the difference between those companies surviving or not.<p>It&#x27;s in the interests of the American public that money ostensibly spent to mitigate the economic and technological fallout of something potentially happening to TSMC is actually effective at mitigating that risk in a sensible way, or if it&#x27;s just a huge handout to Intel that they can happily use to dig a deeper moat around their business.\n\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20240320153008&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;chips-act-grant-intel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20240320153008&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytime...</a>\n\nMeanwhile, BDS just announced a boycott of Intel<p>&gt; “Ethical responsibility and international law aside, by insisting on investing tens of billions of dollars in Israel, a ‘war zone,’ only miles away from occupied Gaza, Intel is putting its leaders’ fanatic ideological commitment to Israel over financial and fiduciary responsibility. Why else would Intel freeze plans to expand its chipmaking manufacturing in Ohio while throwing those billions into Israel, a state committing genocide?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bdsmovement.net&#x2F;Press-Release-BDS-Launches-Boycott-Intel-Global-Campaign\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bdsmovement.net&#x2F;Press-Release-BDS-Launches-Boycott-I...</a>\n\n  lol who cares about that? they can boycott like 95% of US big corporations cause all of them do business in Isreal\n\nI guess the trick is to convince governments that your industry is vital for national security.\n\nI think HPE spent about this much for Autonomy!<p>Just imagine if they had invested in domestic semiconductor manufacturing instead of a shady analytics company!!!\n\nDoes the government get shares as a result of this, or is this investment a gift? Are they really just handing money to a giant corporation?\n\nSo Intel will be buying back $8.5B of its own stock starting when?\n\nI&#x27;ve noticed a trend of pay-walled articles lately on HN. Nothing wrong with journalists being paid, but I&#x27;m beginning to think that they are self-promoting rather than bubbling up organically.\n\nWe spent trillions on the war not so long ago, who knows how many billions just spent in Europe, and hundreds of billions on various programs that do not really produce anything, so when I saw numbers like $8.5B from the government these days it&#x27;s like nothing to me, why is this even a headline? I just can not make sense of it myself anymore.\n\nWhy does Intel need grants to invest into expanding their own business? They have more than enough cash. Just a way to waste taxpayer dollars IMO.\n\nI liked that US govt approved the Chips ACT, but I&#x27;m skeptic whether that will actually meaningfully change the manufacturing ability in-house.<p>The problem with US corporations is they are run by MBA management who are experts in stock price manipulation instead of manufacturing and engineering. So you could spend 100s of Billions and they don&#x27;t materialize into much.<p>We see the same troubles at Boeing.<p>US has over-optimized for finance shenanigans at the cost of hard engineering.<p>SpaceX is perhaps something that truly stands out in terms of radical engineering mindset. If the same funding was applied to NASA they wouldn&#x27;t have achieved a 10th of what SpaceX did.<p>Some corporations are just very inefficient. Intel being one of them.<p>I am for public funds being invested into companies only if they meet certain milestones, and new funding is only done if previous milestones are met.<p>Otherwise it goes from tax payers to some exec&#x27;s pocket.\n\n  I think that this will be a good case study in the future of whether or not you can de-MBA an organization.<p>I can’t remember too many cases of organizations fixing themselves in this context. Microsoft is the largest example I can think of.\n\nCool. So, where you getting that labor you smothered out for shareholder value all those years ago? I both hate this but support this. I hate it because no one will learn their lesson and Chicago economics will go on being a theory from autists imposed on the rest of us with constant “externality” costs. Supportive because any fool not indoctrinated into the Chicago school could have seen what happens on a long enough timeline in such a fragile situation and this technology will make or break a nation in the current zeitgeist.\n\nGood to see capitalism and the free market are alive and well in the US."

It will help if Wikipedia (just giving them as an example) could handle the focus on certain people and topics in an smarter way and not after the facts. Wikipedia has a special opportunity about handling this because it is the canonical general reference on Internet.<p>Hallucinated or not I found a better starting point on [3], a Reddit post of 2 years ago with a comment saying:<p>&quot;Even professional mathematicians are barely qualified to choose the best mathematician in their narrow field of expertise, let alone in general…<p>(Before I left math, the most difficult work I encountered was by Michel Talagrand.)&quot; [4] and last, but would be first indeed his own web page [5].

I emailed him asking about some of his work on invariant means in the 1970s. He said “I had no taste then”, and told me what a waste of time it was.<p>At that point, I decided to go into data science instead of trying to get a post doc…\n\n    How do you feel about that decision now? I left math after my PhD and often find myself feeling nostalgic about it.\n\n      Always something to look forward to in [early] retirement to keep the mind active.\n\n  &gt; [...] and not after the facts<p>Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, they intentionally only cover topics retroactively, and preferably after the dust has settled. They&#x27;re intentionally not intending to be many things, including a source of up to date news: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_no...</a>\n\n    No pun intended. We all see (right?) that one of the cultural topics of the XXI is about focus. In a relative past people could study and&#x2F;or read &quot;all&quot; texts and be intellectuals or feel like that. It is obvious that the focus economy always existed but now there are zillions of potential content to consume (good or not, doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>Wikipedia, as an example, has the opportunity to add layers (not many) of content in the quest of helping (not solving) this focus problem. As you said Wikipedia does not currently has this purpose, but this does not mean that they cannot carry the lit torch and pay attention to the focus economy (wordplay just by chance).<p>It is also important to highlight that Wikipedia has many externalities, it is not just them. For example, Wikipedia results are generally the first that cames up in a search engine and their content is much used in machine learning. In this context, the problem of focus is not just about Wikipedia itself but the &quot;focus graph&quot; that has Wikipedia as one of the top releveant nodes.\n\n      Wikipedia is premised on being a tertiary source, and pays a price for every &quot;layer&quot; of content they add in volunteer time needed to correct inaccuracies, which are constantly being added. People have all sorts of ideas about things Wikipedia could be besides an encyclopedia, but the project is (wisely) not receptive to any of them. Meanwhile: if you&#x27;re right about this, you can just fork and track Wikipedia and do your own site.\n\n        Even, beyond that, Wikipedia, again, as an example, has faults on its own merits: I keep reading about Michel Talagrand and find this entry [1] which mentions his work first but there is no link in [2] to [1] (at least now).<p>I will try to restate this, for the sake of an interesting discussion, in a completely different direction but using Wikipedia as an example: in software engineering we create different kind of tests for our software systems, I think Wikipedia should add &quot;unit tests&quot; and other tests to augment, fix, and link their current content.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Majorization\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Majorization</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michel_Talagrand\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michel_Talagrand</a>\n\n          Wikipedia has more process (and is by most measures, more important and successful) than most software most people work on so I&#x27;m not sure tips from software engineering is what they are missing.\n\n            Are you saying that Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t need to innovate and just leave their organization as it is? I follow Wikipedia since its inception and it seems part of its processes, as in major organizations, amplifies bureaucracy more than process innovation. Any organization is not only their throughput but their processes, including resources as humans.\n\n              I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s any number of things they can do better, but revisiting their entire premise isn&#x27;t just a suggestion, it&#x27;s a request that they become a completely different thing.<p>Wikipedia is probably the single most successful human knowledge project of the last 100 years. It sounds crazy saying that out loud! Maybe it&#x27;s not true! But that it&#x27;s even a colorable argument speaks to how little software engineers have to contribute to its fundamental direction. It&#x27;s not about us.\n\n                Last 5000 years.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t care about AI, but there would be no AI without Wikipedia.\n\n                I agree with you with the importance of Wikipedia but it should be noted the acceleration of technology (not talking about singularity!) that will impact them. It is the acceleration of the means in the relationship of humans with technology. This is a fact.<p>The innovation dilemma is always present, even for NGOs.\n\n    The point is that his work (and by extension himself) was encyclopedia-worthy long before he got the prize. Or he wouldn&#x27;t have gotten the prize. Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t wait until after the oscars to include movie.\n\n      All of us were always free, and are still free, to contribute to making his wiki page better!\n\n        Wikipedia editors delete pages about people not deemed notable enough. Especially women: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;science&#x2F;wikipedia-bias-1.6129073\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;science&#x2F;wikipedia-bias-1.6129073</a> Meanwhile, a list of supplemental roads and rural secondary highways in Kentuck (3000-3499) is encyclopedia-worthy: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Kentucky_supplemental_roads_and_rural_secondary_highways_(3000%E2%80%933499)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Kentucky_supplemental_...</a>\n\n          If we assume that there is a group of people giving a concerted effort to acknowledge women in general, would that not lead to more articles about women being created?  And, <i>purely statistically</i>, would not this in turn lead to more articles about women being rejected for being insufficiently notable?  There is no need to assume bias in Wikipedia editors, the bias could just as well lie with those people who create the many rejected articles.<p>Also, one criteria which Wikipedia must, by necessity, use, is “published articles in other media about the subject”.  If <i>other media</i> are, in general, biased, this would lead to a dearth of articles in other media, which in turn would lead to Wikipedia rejecting new WP articles.\n\n            What evidence is there for said concerted effort?\n\n              &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women&amp;oldid=1170029345\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiPro...</a>&gt;\n\n          How is this statistical problem (which I’m prepared to acknowledge) an actual barrier preventing you from improving any given article?\n\n            Because I&#x27;m not going to put in the work just to see it deleted by zealous editors.\n\n              There is no basis in your purported belief that quality contributions that follow the rules will get deleted.<p>Wikipedia editors are not out there to suppress women— The fact that this de facto happens is more likely a reflection of systemic social issues.\n\n                Surely Wikipedia editors are part of society?

Impressive\n\nI really enjoy this sort of story. Someone persevering in an unpopular arena for the love of it, and then having it become quite essential for the advancement of humanities goals as it is developed.\n\n  thats pretty much also the story of deep learning isn&#x27;t it, i too enjoy reading about researchers who have a pure devotion to their subject.\n\nWhat an amazing output.<p>Reading his papers, he manages to connect basic geometric ideas (like the notion of &quot;isoperimetry&quot;, i.e., enclosing the maximum volume within a given perimeter) to probabilistic notions like convergence of averages. It links together stuff you learn in information theory (the probability mass of the &quot;typical set&quot;), and in machine learning (deviations of an training-set error rate from a true error rate), and in probability theory (empirical processes).<p>His papers typically had an introduction that related the main theorem to some of these basic geometric notions. The introduction would reveal a whole new, very intuitive and geometric connection between a very abstract theorem to basic geometry, like the volume of a spherical shell. It would routinely blow my mind.\n\n&gt; <i>fell in love with his future wife, a statistician, at first sight (he proposed to her three days after meeting her)</i><p>Was that after sampling 1&#x2F;e prospects?<p>(The &quot;marriage problem&quot; is applied statistics on when it&#x27;s optimal to stop searching for something <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secretary_problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secretary_problem</a> )\n\n&gt; He recalls with delight that he once used a cab service whose owner recognized his name, having learned the inequality during a probability class in business school.<p>The taxi drivers in France are cut from different cloth!\n\n  As well as their business students, apparently.\n\n    The French higher education system is such that a lot of business students come from somewhat math-heavy undergraduate programs: 9h hours of math class plus one hour of one-on-one oral examination for 2-3 years.\n\n  I think you missed the part about the owner was the one who went to business school.\n\nSlightly off-topic - has anyone read his book &quot;What is a Quantum Field Theory&quot;? Can you recommend it?\n\n  See a review here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;~woit&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;?p=12819\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;~woit&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;?p=12819</a>\n\n    Thanks! I just saw Peter Woit&#x27;s post on the Abel Prize <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;~woit&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;?p=13877\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;~woit&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;?p=13877</a> also speaks positively about that book.\n\n  I&#x27;ve been reading it over the past few days (picked it up after seeing it mentioned here). It&#x27;s fantastic, much better than many similar attempts to make quantum field theory comprehensible to mathematicians.\n\nIn the NewScientist interview he said, I tried “to understand really well the simple things.”\n\nI didn&#x27;t know about his inequalities, but I found (1) that provides  an example of using Talagrand inequality applied to the  longest  increasing subsequence problem (12 pages, easy to read). It seems to be a broad generalization of the Hamming distance.<p>(1) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.purdue.edu&#x2F;homes&#x2F;hmaji&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;Spring%202018&#x2F;lectures&#x2F;11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.purdue.edu&#x2F;homes&#x2F;hmaji&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;Spring%202018...</a>\n\n  I was about to say that.

No matter the age. No matter what one wants to do.<p>&gt; “I’m not able to learn mathematics easily,” Talagrand tells ... “I have to work. It takes a very long time and I have a terrible memory. I forget things. So I try to work, despite handicaps, and the way I worked was trying to understand really well the simple things. Really, really well, in complete detail. And that turned out to be a successful approach.”<p>Just imagine. You may be super smart who gets things easily and right away. Or, you may be average. Using this philosophy in life, one can excel further."

      "conversation_text": "That&#x27;s nice and all, but google scholar recently removed all the &#x27;cited by&#x27; &#x27;related articles&#x27; and other links from the HTML pages of google scholar. It was like this for about two months before they restored the functionality. It likely they will remove it again soon. Google scholar is getting worse, not better. The google devs have no idea what a typical academic&#x27;s computer is like around the world. They dev for their lived experience and it&#x27;s just not applicable. A javascript (slow, computationally expensive) pdf reader is just another aspect of this ignorance.\n\n  I couldn’t agree more, I dont want you displaying the pdf, let me download the file and view it with zathura\n\n    Or Sioyek (vim keybindings!), Okular, Xournalpp, Zotero, ...\n\n  A js pdf reader they control has monetization possibilities. Slip in an interstitial page for Naturally Fun Arkansas with an article from Nature. You don&#x27;t want scholar going the way of reader do you?\n\n  What are the base hardware requirements for a JavaScript PDF reader where it isn&#x27;t &quot;slow&quot;?\n\n  Alongside this, I have found that Google Scholar&#x27;s search has become noticeably worse in the last year or so. I can search for an author&#x27;s name and a few keywords from a paper title and it won&#x27;t show up, even if the paper has like 5000 citations.\n\n    Wow so I am not going mad! I had the same experience and it almost feels like Google is trying to recommend me papers based on my past searches. I hope they revert to their earlier algorithm\n\n  Are you sure this actually happened? I never noticed this. can anyone else collaborate? Maybe you installed some extension that messed with the html\n\n    Yes, I confirmed it with 3 other people on IRC a couple months ago. I didn&#x27;t know google scholar had restored it until I checked right before I wrote the above post. I thought the links were still gone. They had been the last time I&#x27;d used google scholar about 3 weeks ago. Back then I also confirmed it myself first using 3 different computers, 4 browsers (with JS disabled), coming from 3 different IP addresses, both logged in to google and logged out. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have started writing the post at all if I didn&#x27;t think they were still gone.<p>I figure in addition to the feedback they received from me (and presumably others) at the time they saw a drop in usage and restored the functional version. But they&#x27;ll try again.\n\n      I think you are wrong - I don&#x27;t recall seeing this. Screenshots of scholar on twitter from feb, jan, dec all show those links\n\n        Check at 2024 Feb 08 09:54:00 (am) CST. I definitely didn&#x27;t confabulate the memory because the initial conversation about it (with others) is in my IRC logs. Sorry I don&#x27;t have any screenshots of my own. Perhaps it was A&#x2F;B testing or something.\n\n  Check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openalex.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openalex.org</a><p>I&#x27;m pretty optimistic that by the time google scholar really goes to shit they&#x27;ll be good enough to pick up the slack.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for good local PDF readers for Windows? I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of various papers recently, and clicking on a citation in Acrobat reader is very frustrating. The document scrolls to show the citation in view, but doesn&#x27;t clearly show it in the long list that most papers have, and then I have to scroll up to where I was since it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a working back feature.\n\n  Sioyek is a PDF viewer designed exactly for reading research papers and textbooks: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyek\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyek</a>.\n\n    Sioyek seems awesome, especially vim inspired features.\nToo bad u (undo) doesn&#x27;t work and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to undo. Am I missing something or is it laking it?\n\n      I found this related issue: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyek&#x2F;issues&#x2F;633\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyek&#x2F;issues&#x2F;633</a>\n\n        Improved over that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyek&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1011\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrm&#x2F;sioyek&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1011</a>\n\n    looks cool\n\n  I am interested in knowing why and how Google Chrome is not enough?\n\n    Mostly too slow for a lot of content, not every content is supported, not easy to keep it open at the right page, no comments, not easy to find the right tab, etc.\n\n  I&#x27;ve been using Sumatra PDF on Windows to read papers (and as my default PDF reader) for more than a decade. Clicking on a citation takes you to the bibliography page and lands the cited paper at the top of the screen. Then Alt-leftarrow brings you back.\n\n  ive always used SumatraPDF because its super fast and free\n\n  What you might consider if finding an ebook reader app and using that.  I had a similar issue but on Android (for ebooks not in kindle format).  I ended up with Librera but there are several.  Turns out it&#x27;s also equally great at academic or work PDFs.\n\n  Just so you know: normally it scroll down so that the reference is on top of the page.<p>But most importantly.. ALT+&#x27;left arrow&#x27; allows you to go back before you clicked on the citation! It doesn&#x27;t work all the time, but usually it does after some left arrows ;)<p>Also, in Android: you can click on the &#x27;scrolling sign&#x27; on the right of the pdf and specify the page, or see the link to &#x27;jump back&#x27; to before you clicked on a link!<p>I hope that will help\n\n  Irrespective of the OS, I recommend Zotero (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;</a>).\n\n  Mozilla Firefox has put a lot of time into their PDF reader.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;browsers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;browsers&#x2F;</a>\n\n  Zotero&#x27;s V7 reader is great, built on pdfjs (Mozillas pdf reader) and adds neat things like notations and dark mode.\n\n    is it possible to point Zotero to a local dir with papers, or am I forced to import documents into it?\n\n    I love zotero. The combination of annotation, highlights, document management and a healthy plug-in ecosystem are just killer for me.<p>It feels a bit dated sometimes, but I&#x27;m yet to find anything that comes close.\n\n      It looks a lot nicer after the recent design update!\n\n    IIRC, pdfjs is used by Google also, and was based on Foxit? ? Does anyone know?\n\n      PDF.js came out of Mozilla, not Foxit.\n\n        Yes, but I think Mozilla may have started with code from Foxit.\n\n          The PDFium plugin that was part of Chrome was based on C++ code from Foxit.<p>PDFjs was written in JS from day one, and (as far as I know) was not based on any previous PDF reader.\n\n            Maybe that&#x27;s what I was thinking of. Thanks.<p>BTW, I didn&#x27;t mean they necessarily used the actual Foxit code, but it was a starting point maybe reimplemented in JS.\n\n              In no sense is PDF.js related to Foxit except that they are both PDF readers.\n\n    Where are you accessing Zotero V7? My understanding is that it is currently V6.[1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;</a>\n\n      <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;support&#x2F;beta_builds\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;support&#x2F;beta_builds</a>\n\n        Thanks! I&#x27;ll try it out\n\n    I use Zotero and really like it, especially when working with others. This was the first thing that came into my mind on this thread.\n\n  Same question but for MacOS.  There don&#x27;t seem to be many good ones for it.\n\n    Unfortunately, Preview has been the best reader in my experience. I say &quot;unfortunately&quot; not because it is inherently bad, but because it is a sad state of affairs when nobody can build something better than the barebones native tool\n\n    Try Skim\n\n    Just found this one I hadn&#x27;t seen before, free version may suffice:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highlightsapp.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highlightsapp.net&#x2F;</a>\n\n  SumatraPDF if you want speed above all else<p>DrawboardPDF if you want something more full featured and like to annotate, highlight, bookmark and whatnot, particularly if there&#x27;s any chance you&#x27;ll also use a stylus\n\n  Okular. You don’t need the rest of KDE. It has a Windows installer and I think it‘s also in the Windows Store.\n\n  Jumping back works in SumatraPDF (backspace).<p>STDU Viewer might also be worth looking into. Default shortcut for jumping back is ctrl+z.\n\n  Zotero!\n\nNow all they need is a way to grab documents from SciHub..\n\nThis looks great! Since they link it all to one&#x27;s Gmail account, I wonder if they implement saving annotations to these PDFs and have them live on your Drive or elsewhere.<p>Edit: Also, Chrome now defaults to this extension for rendering any PDFs you load.\n\nDoes anyone know of a library (or reading material) that can render a pdf (mostly architectural drawings) on to webgl canvas as actual vectors not image?\n\n  Not sure if that&#x27;s what you are looking for but mupdf can render to SVG.\n\n  WebGL is inherently a vector-to-raster technology, it’s always backed by a pixel buffer. One might argue that even PDFjs works this way with its calls to the canvas API.<p>What are you trying to do? Why is webgl the key here?\n\n    Basically I am looking to render pdf of architectural drawings onto webgl (because 2d context is too slow), and maintain the vector information in the drawings (ie lines, arcs). I know webgl is eventually raster, but I want to pan&#x2F;zoom while retaining the crispness of vector lines.\n\nMost important papers can be read with highlighting at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;</a> (PDF Semantic Reader, skimming assist)\n\nLooks great, but can you imagine Google pulling the rug under an academic&#x27;s document&#x2F;citation database?<p>I don&#x27;t even want to imagine having to migrate all annotations and citations to something else when they inevitably pull the plug on it some years down the road.\n\n  Huh? This tool just parses PDFs, it doesn&#x27;t require academics to actually do anything.\n\n    Hm, I got the impression they store notes and annotations to your Google account, but maybe I&#x27;m mistaken.\n\n      The Chrome Web Store page doesn&#x27;t say anything about annotations.\n\nHas anyone tried installing this? It says &quot;PDFs on all sites will have a new look in Chrome.&quot;<p>This makes me nervous. I&#x27;m often looking at PDFs that are embedded in a page (either grad school software for commenting on PDFs, or publishers&#x27; sites). Is it going to play nicely with those? Is this only for navigating directly to a PDF?\n\n  My guess (as someone whose company makes a PDF extension for Chrome) is that it may intercept embedded PDFs as well. Sometimes sites use iframes or the like, and those get intercepted. But if the PDF is displayed through some sort of third party tool then it would be unaffected. Just my 2¢!\n\nCapturing and visualizing research knowledge is personally an exciting space. I feel that deep reading and absorbing content continues to be challenging, due to the ever-increasing amount of published research, rudimentary reading apps (Google PDF reader finally addressing issue with easily looking up references), and due to somewhat disconnected tools for reading and note-taking. Similar to the readers piggy-backing on the PDFjs library, I&#x27;ve developed an app that helps me capture and organize personal research knowledge [1]. Additionally, visualizations and customizable contexts for notes help to recall and link information.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knowledgegarden.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knowledgegarden.io&#x2F;</a>\n\n  Zotero does a good job at it, doesn&#x27;t it?\n\n    As a daily Zotero user, not really. The nicest thing I can say about it is, it has plugins and is FOSS. Maybe the new 7.0 release will blow me away, but I&#x27;ve been waiting for it to get out of beta forever.<p>More fundamentally, we need to stop disseminating scholarly work as PDFs, a format primarily designed for print. Plain HTML would be an improvement. Even better than HTML would be an extended variant with scholarly-specific semantic markup and universal, animated, explorable figures. Embedded notebooks would be cool, too, but disseminating data would still be a major challenge. (And I don&#x27;t just mean storage&#x2F;transfer; a lot of researchers are reluctant to share source data to the world.)\n\n      So I&#x27;m a researcher that almost always uses pdfs... Does HTML have the reproducibility that PDF promises? My feeling is that if I store a PDF, it&#x27;ll look the same in a decade. But is HTML the same way? It seems like it relies on the web browser and many other things... How would one manage things like images and gifs? Is there a way to keep everything into one HTML file that&#x27;s easily shareable and feels secure?\n\n        The potential to freeze an HTML page in time with minimal changes at render time is already there. [0] Such an ability can even be baked directly into the rendered HTML page so the viewer would be able to download a copy of the page as it is seen at a given time. Other archiving facilities, such as archive.org, take static snapshots of accessible pages if allowed by the publisher of the page and requested by anyone who wants to make that snapshot.<p>My point is that it is possible to achieve in principle and in practice, albeit that might be practiced as often as one would like to see.<p>-------<p>[0] See SingleFile by gildas at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;single-file&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;single-file&#x2F;</a>: “Save an entire web page—including images and styling—as a single HTML file.”\n\n          I like SingleFile, but it&#x27;s not perfect. It usually works just fine, but will occasionally drop the ball depending on the type of JavaScript on the page.<p>For example, I once backed up a page using it, and while it got all the content, it did not grab the JavaScript necessary for the images to display correctly.\n\n        I explored tools to export&#x2F;interchange PDF to HTML in the KnowledgeGarden app, but the results were not optimal, suffering from non-standard layout and poor typesetting of equations. Publishers of scholarly articles generate web pages of papers, but they&#x27;re not replicas of PDF files.<p>Re. self-contained HTML (and slightly off-topic), look at TiddlyWiki, which contains data&#x2F;code&#x2F;layout all in one interactive, local or hosted HTML. Extensibility, plugins, and community of contributors are some key highlights, among others.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiddlywiki.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiddlywiki.com</a>\n\n        Machines and humans can both easily use HTML&#x2F;XML. Extracting information from PDF’s is so much harder that there’s deep learning products dedicated to doing it. They still make mistakes, too.<p>I’d much rather have something akin to the CHM files where everything I need is in one file, easy to analyze, and has good readers.\n\n        I&#x27;d like to see PDFs move to Computational Notebooks.  One can dream.\n\n          That&#x27;d be so nice. Imagine executing the code for an ai paper and seeing the beautiful visualizations as you read it.\n\n        &gt; Does HTML have the reproducibility that PDF promises? My feeling is that if I store a PDF, it&#x27;ll look the same in a decade.<p>Feelings and promises are each one thing.  Reality is another.  PDF doesn&#x27;t even look &quot;the same&quot; today.  I have serious questions about how often folks who think that PDF is reliably consistent from system to system step outside their bubble and just how diverse their setups are that they&#x27;re testing on.<p>&gt; is HTML the same way?<p>Well the status-quo for copy-and-paste in HTML isn&#x27;t dogshit, it&#x27;s comparatively trivial to find and use tools that can thoroughly and exhaustively search your collection (or even write your own), and HTML is a dead simple plain-text format that if worst comes to worst you can read with your eyes (unlike needing to run a bunch of inscrutable code from a PostScript subset through an interpreter before you can do anything with it).  So, no, I wouldn&#x27;t call them the same.\n\n      &gt; As a daily Zotero user, not really. The nicest thing I can say about it is, it has plugins and is FOSS. Maybe the new 7.0 release will blow me away, but I&#x27;ve been waiting for it to get out of beta forever.<p>Can you elaborate where you think Zotero drops the ball?\n\n        one major issue with zotero is the lack of android support. they are working on an android version or app or something since forever.<p>then is the way you store the pfds. if you want to sync between multiple computers you have to either know how to work with webdav or know how to point zotero at the location where you have your pdfs or (what they most certainly love) pay a lot of money for not so much storage space on their system. that last thing is what i don&#x27;t like because i just don&#x27;t trust anyone these days. you get invested in a system, build your routine around it only for them to shut it down, sell it watever and then puff you have to start over.<p>people keep calling zotero foss but if they were truly foss they would have a much more transparent way for people to roll their own selfhosted zotero server. instead, what they have is a dump of an old version, with next to zero documentation and a bunch of stubborn people that have managed to get something working but not quite.<p>I get that they are trying to make money but I am sure they could do that and be more transparent.<p>The other thing is the reliance on so many plugins. While zotero itself may last a while, who can say anything about the many devs of the many plugins that you end up relying on in order to make zotero bow to your routine? I like zotfile and a few others, but how long are they going to last? Also, reinstalling my system is a huge pain to get back to my routine because I have to remember all the settings for each and every plugin I install. They should come up with a way to save all these settings and restore them, and no don&#x27;t do it through another plugin!\n\n          Here&#x27;s a guide I found useful to set up zotero storage.  In brief, it relies on zotfile to flatten the storage (keep all pdfs in one directory) and better bibtex.<p>I realized that it helped me to get rid of exactly the pain with fresh installs that you mention.  I realized that the two plugins give me most of the functionality that I want.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habr.com&#x2F;ru&#x2F;articles&#x2F;443798&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habr.com&#x2F;ru&#x2F;articles&#x2F;443798&#x2F;</a>\n\nCan someone recommend an app for ipad that can read PDFs? I want to be able to bookmark using my browser but read it on my ipad. Sort of like &quot;Save to pocket&quot; extension.\n\n  In theory the built in files app will work for this. However, I like goodnotes, which has good highlighting snd library support. I’ve used it since grad school for reading papers.\n\n  I really like PDF Expert for this. It&#x27;s free. They have a subscription for some editing&#x2F;advanced features, which I haven&#x27;t tried.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;pdf-expert-editor-reader&#x2F;id743974925\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;pdf-expert-editor-reader&#x2F;id743...</a>\n\n  Zotero w&#x2F; their first-party storage is the best I&#x27;ve found.\n\n  Primarily I&#x27;ve been using Zotero and Notability. They each have &quot;save to&quot; on mobile. Zotero has a chrome plugin that requires the desktop app to be running.  They both optionally support a dark mode for reading in the dark.<p>I like the experience of reading in Muse.app on the iPad. It&#x27;s a nested whiteboarding thing, but also can act as a PDF reader. (It&#x27;ll let you pull out chunks of the PDF and put it on your canvas with a link back into your document, if that fits your flow.) I often read on my phone, so this is not an option for me.<p>Apple Notes and Muse slow down with a lot of ink. For taking a page full of notes I&#x27;m using Notability.<p>I&#x27;ve heard good things about GoodReader, but haven&#x27;t played with it in years.\n\n  Square icon with up arrow sticking out of it -&gt; Save to books.<p>It seems to work in MacOS and iOS; an iCloud account is probably required.\n\n  <i>&gt; bookmark using my browser but read it on my ipad</i><p>MacOS and iPad: DevonThink paid app with sync via P2P, WebDAV or cloud services.<p>Optional local mirror&#x2F;sync of web pages and PDFs, with full text search.\n\n  I use Readdle Documents to sync PDF folders with my server PC via FTP. Free version supports PDF highlighting &amp; simple annotations, basic file management, and automatically syncs back everything.\n\nI just wish Google Scholar would be a bit more open in terms of debugging why a site isn&#x27;t picked up by the platform\n\n  I would also be interested to know how they decide <i>to</i> pick up a site. I was very surprised to learn that a technical note posted only to my website was picked up somehow. (I am a mathematician and so there are other things on my site, but it’s some custom static site generator thing and I’m still astounded).\n\nDoes anyone have a research paper reading tool they&#x27;re happy with? Zotero is what meets most of my needs but I wish I could organize the papers faster and I wish the annotation tools were better. AI-assisted reading is a plus too.\n\n  What does AI assisted reading mean to you?\n\n    Those &quot;chat with a PDF&quot; apps get me halfway there, but I&#x27;m more imagining something that can explain certain terms in the context of the paper, or automatically dive into the citations and pull explanations from them too.\n\n  Mendeley beat Zotero for me with automatic pdf renaming, organising and its highlight and note taking tools in the reader.<p>The Elsevier account integration is disgusting though, and I hate the idea of using all Elsevier product.\n\n    What do you like about organization in Mendeley?\n\n      Ever since the big UX app overhaul there is not much to like regarding functionality. They removed the pdf renaming and some other major automated file mgmt features from mendeley.<p>Other than that the commenting and note reader UI was pretty good. And overall UI&#x2F;UX felt more modern than Zotero, also free (as in beer) cloud backup.<p>Today I had to do some literature review, and I reinstalled Zotero 7beta because I am not happy with the removed functionality from Mendeley.\n\n    I use zotfile extension to automatically rename files in Zotero\n\n  Paperpile is fantastic and you can make a shared folder with your lab&#x2F;team.\n\n  I was also unhappy with how reference managers handle annotations. So I rolled my own app (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcahier.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcahier.com</a>), with highlight management integrated in the application. This enables me to extract highlights according to topics, organize them in notes using document elements (like collapsible notes and outlines) and use them to plan more complex arguments. This makes it much easier to read actively.<p>On the paper organization side, I would also like to find out a better way of doing it. What helps me a lot, from a more methodological perspective, is to categorize books according to time period, school of thoughts, or perspective.\n\n    Cahier looks great! Any plans to add backup&#x2F;sync?<p>Also, is the data store encrypted at rest even when the app is actively being used?\n\n      Thanks! I&#x27;m considering that. We might first implement P2P or external services (dropbox, iCloud) sync, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>The data is all local, so there&#x27;s no need for encryption yet. But when we implement sync it&#x27;ll be end to end encrypted.\n\n    Doesn&#x27;t support Linux though or any of the unixes. Looks good though.\n\n      Thank you for your interest! I&#x27;ve received that request more than I thought I would. It&#x27;s high on the priority list now, and will arrive soon.\n\n  I use Zotero with a bunch of useful Addons. Currently, scite is best available tool for research papers (at least in my field).\n\n    Scite seems to apply to all fields, any reason why it&#x27;s particularly good in yours?\n\n  I use a combination of Zotero, Locally Linked PDFs&#x2F;Folder Structure, and SumatraPDFs (Comments etc.):<p><pre><code>    folders:\n        - for every literature search, create a folder with date and name\n            - e.g. 2024-03-21_Quantum_Entanglement\n            - use CTRL-SHIFT-DRAG to drop files into Zotero as Links, see [#77](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zotero&#x2F;zotero&#x2F;issues&#x2F;77)\n            - You _can_ organize in Zotero, but you don&#x27;t have to.

It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been looking for.\n\n      Did you check the `zotero-better-notes`? [1]<p>&gt; LaTex math in Zotero note is no longer a dream. The `zotero-better-notes` addon now supports this feature!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;windingwind&#x2F;zotero-better-notes\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;windingwind&#x2F;zotero-better-notes</a>\n\n        Thanks for that :)\n\n  Readwise Reader has a nice pdf reader with highlighting, notes, and an AI reader tool. I organize sources using tags. It&#x27;s very new and in active development. Academic research is not it&#x27;s main focus, though, so it probably won&#x27;t add mindblowing academic tools. (like citation support&#x2F; backlinks. although it does have internet backlinks that tell you want articles link to the one you&#x27;re reading)\n\n    Readwise Reader is a poor PDF reader, unfortunately. Where it shines is making readable text documents out of PDFs, so it depends on the type that you’re reading.\n\n  pdf-tools [1] + org-ref [2] in Emacs.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vedang&#x2F;pdf-tools\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vedang&#x2F;pdf-tools</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jkitchin&#x2F;org-ref\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jkitchin&#x2F;org-ref</a>\n\n  Nothing quite beats a simple google docs file where I can take notes and put links to sci-hub. Very often, legal download links expire after some time or they force the browser to download the pdf.<p>I have a google docs for each research project and thus I can share them with my collaborators. Each person has their own section within the doc so we can also easily share information with each other!\n\n  evince recently added some features that I now find it hard to live without. The biggest is that if I mouseover an internal link in a pdf, it shows a little preview of where that link would take me - so if I&#x27;m reading a long document and the author says &quot;by Theorem 3.3 it holds...&quot; and if the pdf is recent enough for &quot;Theorem 3.3&quot; to be an internal link, then I can mouseover to remind myself of the statement of Theorem 3.3!\n\n    That seems really useful, thank you!\n\nI&#x27;ve never seen so many light&#x2F;dark modes before. There&#x27;s Device Mode, Light Mode, Dark Mode, and Night Mode. AFAICT Device Mode follows the browser&#x2F;device&#x27;s current setting, Dark Mode makes the sidebar dark but doesn&#x27;t change the PDF, and Night Mode darkens both the sidebar and the PDF. I wonder how they decided to have so many modes?\n\n  I’ve seen other apps that have Systen, Light, Dark, and “Very Datk” for OLED devices, so it isn’t out of the question\n\n    Did you put &quot;Very Datk&quot; in quotes because it was spelled like that where you saw it?  Or is it just &quot;Very Dark&quot; and it&#x27;s quotes because it doesn&#x27;t fully imply what you get?\n\n      i put it in quotes because it&#x27;s a funny<p>i&#x27;ve variously seen apps call this &quot;Extra Dark,&quot; &quot;Midnight mode,&quot; &quot;OLED dark,&quot; &quot;Pure Black&quot;, ...\n\n  Automatically applying dark mode to documents tends to have poor results, especially when images are involved, but some people are masochists and&#x2F;or can&#x27;t be bothered to turn on the light, so they made a separate setting for them. Although I think a toggle would be better instead of dark mode&#x2F;night mode.\n\n&gt; Scholar PDF Reader is available as a Chrome browser extension<p>So it&#x27;s a closed ecosystem for now ... pass.\n\nFor me, reading papers requires deep focus. I have to have it physically printed out if I&#x27;m going to really read the whole thing.\n\n  I suggest you try new devices to read papers. Often the perception that paper is a better support is due to a lack of more convenient devices. Paper is better than a 15&#x27;&#x27; screen for sure, for many reasons including size and posture while reading. But have you tried larger screens (&gt; 27&#x27;&#x27;), large tablets (&gt;= A4) or as large as possible E-Ink readers? Depending on your preferences, you might find that some of these work actually better than paper also for you :-)\n\n    Remarkable 2 tablet is very good for reading papers.\n\n    There is no way I can perceive reading on an expensive device as more comfortable than paper.  Paper is fairly cheap, lightweight and resilient; I can carry it around, fold it, toss it aside, sit on it by accident while thinking, annotate it with scribbles, and pour coffee on it with aplomb and finesse.  I can flip it, half-tear it in anger, drool on it when I reach my brain capacity.  I can take it hiking with me without fear of breaking or losing it.  In other words, paper is a tool that gets out of my way.<p>I did try all the devices you listed above, even had my department pay serious money, and ended up barely using them for all those reasons.  I am a mathematician, I am clumsy and I want to focus on my problem-solving; I want to think, and babysitting devices and tools is not what I want to spend my brainspace on.\n\n      &quot;But did you think about the environment? Why don&#x27;t you by a new device every 2 years with Lithium battery and full of non recyclable plastic in it&quot;<p>... is what I get told all the time.\n\n        With the typical reading volume of an academic and the amount of plastic in my toner cartridges, I&#x27;m not sure paper comes out ahead in that comparison.\n\n          A high yield toner cartridge can print between 3000 and 8000 pages of text [1]. Average number of pages in a scientific manuscript is 10 [2]. This means that it would take 300 to 800 printed scientific papers to deplete one cartridge. I would have to assume that a single toner cart is not the same amount of waste as a reading device just due to the recyclability of toner carts, but it is up to you how to count them. If I was going to pull a number out of my ass, I would say 10 carts would be equal to one reading device with battery. Let&#x27;s go low-end and pick 300 papers, which means you would need to print 3000 full scientific manuscripts to equal the waste of one reading device. How many do you read in two years?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brother-usa.com&#x2F;supplies&#x2F;ink-and-toner#sort=relevancy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brother-usa.com&#x2F;supplies&#x2F;ink-and-toner#sort=rele...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3987331&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3987331&#x2F;</a>\n\n        In my experience those people don&#x27;t even talk about ink, it&#x27;s all about paper. They must think that you get just a few sheets of paper for a single tree or something like that, when in reality you get like 10 000 sheets of paper for one averagish tree. And those trees are not rare or anything like that, and the process of making paper is nowhere near as bad as electronics industry. Using paper is as ecological as it gets.\n\n    I’m typing this comment on an iPad ;-) Which I love using for marking up papers and other documents for quick feedback. But doing research is another story.\n\n    Paper enables non-vision based(scroll bar) random access to content, when you keep going back an forth between two pages, it is very annoying on all current devices except paper. Vision pro&#x2F;VR&#x2F;AR or a particular multi-screen set-up can achieve that, but so far all alternatives are not as good.\n\nI use a tool called Scholars<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scholars.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scholars.io</a><p>Let you import and read PDF directly, annotate, comment and share with people.\n\n&gt; You can focus on absorbing the scholarship – the format is simple and clean.<p>Unless you need to scroll left and right on your phone instead of absorbing\n\n&quot;..have long loved PDFs&quot; not.\n\nHmm, nice to have direct links to references. But the PDF rendering itself seems not as good as the native renderer.\n\n  Just tried it and didn&#x27;t notice any significant differences in PDF rendering myself. Do you have any concrete examples?\n\nHa ha lol. Is that really the best they can think of in an age of AI? Instead of turning PDFs into web pages how about some actually useful tools:<p>* Summarisation<p>* Succinctly placing the research in context of the broader field<p>* Highlighting limitations or flaws in research methods, etc.<p>* An outline view to summarise each paragraph&#x2F;section and then drill down into the ones you actually want to read in more detail<p>* Rephrasing into plain English. A lot of academics enjoy sounding clever and usling long words so it&#x27;d be nice to be able to switch off &quot;ego mode&quot; and just read stuff in plain English instead of having to wade through their word-soup.<p>With more effort maybe Google could create a PDF reader that is actually innovative.\n\n  The friends I have in academia say that their PhD professors tell them to use &quot;ego mode&quot; or papers won&#x27;t pass review and be accepted. I&#x27;m with you though. And it&#x27;s not about specific jargon of a field, it&#x27;s just wankery. Most lawyers do the same thing and you need to get extremely good ones to write good contracts in clear language.<p>&quot;Sounding smarter through obscurity&quot;\n\n    Yeah I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true. It&#x27;d be nice to be able to opt out though while you&#x27;re in the first pass research phase.\n\nCan someone recommend lightweight alternatives to Paperpile or EndNote that have two essential features:\n1. Rename a PDF file to a consistent (Author Year Journal) format.\n2. Online sync (Mac, iOS and web access) - including via say iCloud or Dropbox.<p>Maybe this just needs a script? I just paid $100 for EndNote 21 yesterday and don’t think these needs justify that cost.\n\n  Maybe try Zotero[1]. There are many addons which can do what you need.<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;</a>\n\nAlready counting the days until this inevitably gets killed. I&#x27;ve been burned too many times to rely on Google for anything, except tracking me and pushing ads, which they indeed do better every day.\n\n  Scholar is heavily used internally, it’s unlikely to be discontinued even if it has never brought any money to Google.\n\n    This is about a PDF reader though, not Google Scholar itself.\n\n    Google Reader and RSS feeds were also heavily used internally :(\n\n      What replaced it - Google Wave ???.\n\n  I wonder if their real intent is to gather training data on which parts of papers are considered important by readers, and which topics are related to each other.\n\n  Even so, isn&#x27;t something better than nothing?\n\n  Totally agree, seems all\nGoogle stuff has a life expectancy countdown\n\n  google has worked hard to earn this reputation. i don&#x27;t want to rely on any part of the google ecosystem anymore.\n\nSo I guess this a way for Google to gather (more&#x2F;fine-grain) data on paper skimming&#x2F;research interest?\n\nWhen can we have a PDF reader where we can hover over a symbol and see its definition?\n\n  What kind of symbol?\n\nAlt+&lt;- brings you back to where you were after clicking on a reference. You can skip around pretty easily to see the referenced object and this overlay does seem kinda interesting it’s not something crucial.\n\nZotero is the one I use but found this one useful too: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthical.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthical.com&#x2F;</a>\n\nIt is really nice to see google scholar get some attention. It is essential for a lot of academics and it would be horrible if google &quot;sunset&quot;ed it.\n\nI use an extension called histre, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;histre.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;histre.com&#x2F;</a> for annotation and keeping up with _notes_ &#x2F; _thoughts_ inline. I found that using tools like Fermat&#x27;s Library, which provides side bar annotation, histre for inline highlight, annotation and multi-references, and ChatGPT to understand complex terms, all helped with understand recent papers. Even a medical journal paper, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senthil.learntosolveit.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;medical-journal-paper-on-stroke.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senthil.learntosolveit.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;medical-...</a>   for me, in one instance.\n\n  I tried Google Scholar after this comment. Google Scholar PDF is a valuable addition to the research community. There isn&#x27;t any tool that can give direct hyperlink to the references in the research paper, and this does it, as inline hover, and it is incredibly useful to navigate and follow the references.\n\nThis will be in the Google Graveyard <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com&#x2F;</a> by mid-2026."

The most exciting UX development maybe ever in the history of computing is a chat interface. On mobile, it’s all scrolling through rectangles. It’s not looking good for the designers.\n\n          <i>&gt; “It’s not looking good for the designers.”</i><p>Only if you think that the job of a designer in the software industry is to add graphics.<p>By similar logic, the past hundred years have been bad for architects because there are no more stone gargoyles added to buildings.\n\n      &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t use either Lottie or Rive for static animations.&quot;<p>I guess that depends on your use case. If you only have this animation on your website, then probably no. But if you load and run the rive engine anyway, because you build a game with it - then why not also use it for &quot;static animations&quot;, if the result can be way sharper?\n\n    I&#x27;m excited about this. As that post explains, it&#x27;s very hard to have anything beyond basic interactivity with a lottie animation. It looks like Rive provides much more facility for interactivity.  Also if it works I can cancel my Adobe subscription.\n\n  Seems like Duolingo apparently uses both? Or perhaps one of these is out of date.<p>&gt;As Duolingo’s products grow and evolve to reach even more learners around the world, Lottie animations help us keep users engaged, delighted, and always learning.[0]<p>&gt;We thought the answer might lie in an alternative to a game engine —something that can help us take a limited number of assets and turn those into a virtually unlimited number of combinations. This is how we learned about Rive![1]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lottiefiles.com&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;duolingo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lottiefiles.com&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;duolingo</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.duolingo.com&#x2F;world-character-visemes&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.duolingo.com&#x2F;world-character-visemes&#x2F;</a>\n\n  I&#x27;ve replaced Lottie animations with Rive, and am pretty happy doing so thus far.\n\n&gt; It isn’t hyperbolic to say what you can do with Rive is about to change in an earth-shattering way.<p>Actually, I think this is exactly what &quot;hyperbolic&quot; means\n\n  If not, that would be extremely concerning.\n\n    &quot;We&#x27;ve studied their language enough to get a good understanding.  It seems the creatures on this planet created the source of their own undoing - a UX  so well antialiased, so quickly rendered, that it shattered the planet.&quot;\n\n      Well if any component of a game engine would render our planet uninhabitable, I imagine it would be the renderer.\n\n  It will <i>literally</i> blow your mind. It&#x27;s already been responsible for several deaths from traumatic head injury.\n\n  If it&#x27;s not hyperbolic, I think we ought to ban this... Call me picky, but I think breaking the only planet we live on right now is a bad idea\n\nLooks kinda interesting but I am not gonna touch anything that thinks an acceptable set of drawing tools is &quot;pen and a couple of basic shapes&quot;, I quit pulling out every single point by hand in Illustrator a decade ago and my art <i>and</i> my job satisfaction has been much better for it. Finding the right settings for Illustrator&#x27;s pencil tool (the defaults are absolutely useless) sped up my work by at <i>least</i> one order of magnitude.<p>Using the pen tool for all your shapes is about as efficient as using Photoshop&#x27;s pencil tool to set every pixel yourself, or writing your entire app in assembly.\n\n  Re:<p>&gt; Looks kinda interesting but I am not gonna touch anything that thinks an acceptable set of drawing tools is &quot;pen and a couple of basic shapes&quot;, I quit pulling out every single point by hand in Illustrator a decade ago and my art and my job satisfaction has been much better for it.<p>How do you work differently now?\n\n    Pencil tool. The defaults are absolute trash that make it impossible to sketch with, and useless for drawing filled shapes; once you discover it has settings and play with them, it becomes absurdly fast.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking it&#x27;s time to move on to Moho or Toon Boom though, I&#x27;ve been wanting to make stuff move, and I&#x27;m real tired of Adobe leaving all kinds of annoying broken edges unfixed for years.\n\n  cmon, this is just a renderer<p>They have tools but you&#x27;d have to pay for them, big bucks\n\n    yeah, I was curious about the animation program this is a renderer for\n\n  FWIW Most folks are animating in rive not drawing with the reduced set of tools. In their tutorials you see them demonstrating their PSD layer support, for example.\n\n    Moving around stuff drawn in another program is boring, and gives me flashbacks to back around 2000 when I was moving around stuff at the end of a lengthy multi-person chain that started on paper. Drawing stuff in the same program I&#x27;m moving stuff around in and using its rigging&#x2F;distortion tools to do inbetweening is fun. I really gotta make time to seriously dig into Moho or Toon Boom soon because I keep on missing animation lately.\n\nDidn&#x27;t we already do this experiment with Flash? Macromedia&#x2F;Adobe made the player free, and charged for tools. In the same way, it seems that Rive wants to open source the player and then charge for the editor. Maybe its a bit different since Rive seems targeted at game devs using other platforms like Unity and Unreal - presumably to embed things like cinematics? But then of course you have this (OSS) player, which implies Rive <i>also</i> wants to own the whole experience. Hence the reference to Flash.<p>It&#x27;s not really my area, but best of luck to you!\n\n  That&#x27;s a really great comparison, and great point that this is just the renderer. I&#x27;m happy to see it released under an MIT license, but I wonder how many OSS tools there are to build compatible content, and how easy it would be to build exporters from other formats in existing tools.\n\n    Our entire runtime and format are open-source. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;runtimes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;runtimes</a>\nWe charge for the editor, but everything else is open.\n\n  Flash was great, someone creating a better Flash has been long overdue. I think Rive looks like a great attempt at a new Flash.\n\n    The Flash tooling is still around, actually.  It&#x27;s now called Adobe Animate and targets existing web standards.\n\n      Did that pivot ever really work?<p>I know Adobe renamed Flash, and I haven&#x27;t talked to anyone in the cartoons space since then, but it seems like innovation&#x2F;attention to the Flash toolchain died with the player.\n\n        We used to use a tool called flump to rasterize flash animations for iOS games (I ended up writing our runtime and renderer in Unity and later SpriteKit to consume that data). I bet it wouldn’t be too hard to build an exporter from Flash (the program, now Animate) to this runtime if the features are fairly compatible.\n\n          Flump was a fantastic tool in the early mobile days when there wasn’t really anything else to create quality 2D animations. I also wrote a few Flump runtimes and have since written a few more runtimes utilizing the Export as Texture Atlas feature in Adobe Animate. If the goal is to just render the rasterized output from the exported texture atlas animations it should be pretty simple to create a converter.<p>If the goal is to render vectors I imagine it is more complicated due to quirks in how Macromedia triangulated their vectors, but someone has done it before <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bwhiting.co.uk&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;introducing-b2dlite&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bwhiting.co.uk&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;introducing-...</a>\n\n  and think of how much better flash could have been if the player and file format were open, and third party tools didn&#x27;t have to reverse engineer them!\n\n  There was Scaleform, and it looks like it&#x27;s been discontinued along with Flash - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scaleform_GFx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scaleform_GFx</a>\n\nThere&#x27;s a lot of active research around rendering 2-d vector graphics with GPU tessellation (Raph Levien&#x27;s work for instance), so this is pretty cool that they&#x27;re shipping a product with this technique.<p>I&#x27;ve never used Rive so I&#x27;m wondering if its strictly for making cool animations or if it can be used for building dynamic UI&#x27;s (the kind that you might use an immediate mode gui lib for)?\n\n  We have customers shipping full UI with Rive! Games have been adopting us (some cool AAA titles already in progress) and products too.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;game-ui\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;game-ui</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-age-of-learning-uses-rive-to-a-b-test-their-upsell-experiences\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-age-of-learning-uses-rive-to-a-b-t...</a>\n\n    Bevy but not Godot?\n\n      Bevy is written in Rust and according to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rive-app&#x2F;rive-bevy&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rive-app&#x2F;rive-bevy&#x2F;</a>, the backend used for the integration uses Vello (also Rust), not the Rive renderer. Could be that integrating Vello into the C++-based Godot would be finicky. With the Rive renderer open-sourced, maybe both Rive and Godot will see an integration using the Rive renderer?\n\n        I’m quite interested in Rive + Godot<p>Incidentally, I recently opened a PR to add Metal to Godot via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;godotengine&#x2F;godot&#x2F;pull&#x2F;88199\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;godotengine&#x2F;godot&#x2F;pull&#x2F;88199</a>\n\n      Never tried using it, but this github repo shows rive + godot4 in some fashion<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kibble-cabal&#x2F;godot-rive\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kibble-cabal&#x2F;godot-rive</a>\n\n  One of the things that makes Rive great for dynamic UI components is the excellent state machine deeply supported by the editor: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.rive.app&#x2F;editor&#x2F;state-machine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.rive.app&#x2F;editor&#x2F;state-machine</a><p>While I&#x27;ve built some fairly complex UI with Rive, one area I haven&#x27;t explored is programmatically adding elements or say changing UI text based on external events.\n\nHow does the rendering performance of this compare to something like Skia or Pathfinder? Note that the latter can also optionally do the paths-to-triangles conversion step using GPU compute, if the hardware supports that.  There&#x27;s also Vello for a more comprehensive compute-based approach to 2D rendering.\n\n  We need to do some newer benchmarking, the Rive Renderer has gotten faster since these initial tests: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;guidorosso&#x2F;status&#x2F;1595187838454140928\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;guidorosso&#x2F;status&#x2F;1595187838454140928</a>\n\n    Can you talk a bit about text rendering? How does it compare to slug? [1] Would it be suitable for rendering text heavy applications? (like, say, a PDF viewer, a code editor, web browser, etc).<p>--<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sluglibrary.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sluglibrary.com&#x2F;</a>\n\n      The Rive renderer takes an animation-first approach to all path rendering, including text. Meaning, every glyph is redrawn from raw bezier curves with full precision antialiasing, every frame. (Just like any other path.)<p>This optimizes the smoothness of animation, is fast enough to render fullscreen pages on top of pages of high dpi text at 120fps (on a decent GPU), and the antialiasing quality is always full precision in the (0..255) color channels.<p>If you want more niche text-specific features like hinting and clear text, those aren’t supported because they don’t animate smoothly and&#x2F;or don’t work as well with colors other than black and white.<p>I recommend trying all the options for your specific needs and finding what works best!\n\n        How is antialiasing implemented in the Rive renderer? It doesn&#x27;t appear to be using MSAA. I took a look at the source code, I found some shaders that mention coverage and AA, but I cannot figure out how it works.\n\n  Looking at the GPU tech used and the committer names in that repo, I&#x27;m pretty confident this will at very least compete with both Skia and Pathfinder.  I&#x27;m not super familiar with Vello.<p>These are solid tech choices by people who know what they&#x27;re doing... definitely worth the effort to check its performance and quality out for yourself.<p>These GPU-first renderers all have slightly different approaches and each probably occupies a best-in-class niche for some multidimensional space of quality x performance x hardware&#x2F;driver support x ease of integration.  If you&#x27;re not happy with one of the four, the others are all worth checking out.\n\n    &gt; <i>I&#x27;m pretty confident this will at very least compete with both Skia and Pathfinder</i><p>Couldn&#x27;t Vello be embed &#x2F; used by Skia, Cairo et al, if those renderers wanted to use GPU Compute instead of CPU&#x27;s for preprocessing?\n\n      Skia does include some support for using Vello for rendering but it&#x27;s just experimental, not enabled by default.\n\n  At least one of their runtime implementations I checked out was implemented on top of Skia. Looks like they support a number of possible backends!\n\n  I&#x27;m looking forward to doing careful benchmarking, as this renderer absolutely looks like it will be competitive. It turns out that is <i>really</i> hard to do, if you want meaningful results.<p>My initial take is that performance will be pretty dependent on hardware, in particular support for pixel local storage[1]. From what I&#x27;ve seen so far, Apple Silicon is the sweet spot, as there is hardware support for binning and sorting to tiles, and then asking for fragment shader execution to be serialized within a tile works well. On other hardware, I expect the cost of serializing those invocations to be much higher.<p>One reason we haven&#x27;t done deep benchmarking on the Vello side is that our performance story is far from done. We know one current issue is the use of device atomics for aggregating bounding boxes. We have a prototype implementation [2] that uses monoids for segmented reduction, and that looks like a nice improvement. Additionally, we plan to do f16 math (which should be a major win especially on mobile), as well as using subgroups for various prefix sum steps (subgroups are in the process of landing in WebGPU[3]).<p>Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled to see this released as open source, and that there&#x27;s so much activity in fast GPU vector graphics rendering. I&#x27;d love to see a future in which CPU path rendering is seen as being behind the times, and this moves us closer to that future.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawn.googlesource.com&#x2F;dawn&#x2F;+&#x2F;refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;dawn&#x2F;features&#x2F;pixel_local_storage.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawn.googlesource.com&#x2F;dawn&#x2F;+&#x2F;refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;da...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linebender&#x2F;vello&#x2F;issues&#x2F;259\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linebender&#x2F;vello&#x2F;issues&#x2F;259</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4306\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4306</a>\n\nAny chance of publishing the algorighm details? The main header (pls.hpp) mentions some links to private google docs.\n\n  Thanks for pointing this out! We need to \nmake these public.<p>For the 10,000 foot view, watch our presentation at the WebGL&#x2F;WebGPU meetup at GDC!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khronos.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;webgl-webgpu-meetup-GDC-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khronos.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;webgl-webgpu-meetup-GDC-2024</a>\n\nI&#x27;ve been looking forward to this ever since they announced it. Previously they used Skia and their entire app is (and rendering output was) built with Flutter. Now Flutter has a new rendering engine via Impeller which is more optimized than Skia for Flutter specific challenges.<p>When I asked the Impeller team before what they thought of the Rive renderer, they said that it is great for vector graphics but Impeller needs to also deal with all of the UI related rendering challenges like displaying text properly, so they&#x27;re not a one to one comparison. Hopefully with this renderer being open source now, both teams can learn from each other.\n\n  Correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t fonts rendered from vector graphics already? TTF and OTF are vector formats, correct?\n\n    Fonts begin as vector graphics, but every single character on your screen isn&#x27;t rendered as a tiny, individual vector graphic. Text rendering libraries use a lot of optimizations to cache rasterized glyphs because they&#x27;re reused all over your screen.<p>It also gets extraordinarily complex when you have to handle text layout, kerning, languages that read in different directions, styles, and all of the other complications that come with font rendering.<p>TrueType fonts even support a small virtual machine to process tiny code programs related to font rendering. It&#x27;s an incredibly deep topic.\n\n      Thank you for your insight!\n\n      &gt; small virtual machine to process tiny code programs<p>Or even WebAssembly (though more of an experiment than anything): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;harfbuzz&#x2F;harfbuzz&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;wasm-shaper.md\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;harfbuzz&#x2F;harfbuzz&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;wasm-sha...</a>\n\n      This, but see also Text Rendering Hates You <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faultlore.com&#x2F;blah&#x2F;text-hates-you&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faultlore.com&#x2F;blah&#x2F;text-hates-you&#x2F;</a>\n\n    These glyphs are indeed defined in terms of vector paths (quadratic or cubic Bezier splines depending on the font format), but it’s rarely a good idea to directly render these shapes to display text.<p>Performance optimizations mentioned in the other comments is not the sole reason. Another one is visual quality.<p>Direct rendering of these vector glyphs would look good on high DPI displays and&#x2F;or for very large font sizes. For normal-looking text on typical displays you won’t achieve great results without hinting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Font_hinting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Font_hinting</a><p>Another quality related problem is subpixel rendering <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Subpixel_rendering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Subpixel_rendering</a> Just like hinting, hard to solve while directly rendering vector shapes.\n\nThis looks extremely cool and I&#x27;m excited to use it in my own personal hobby projects.<p>It looks like the somewhat standardised Cairo&#x2F;Skia&#x2F;canvas&#x2F;NanoVG API (moveTo, lineTo, etc.) is provided so should hopefully take not much effort to learn, I&#x27;m hoping.<p>(I do see lineTo here at the very least. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rive-app&#x2F;rive-renderer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;renderer&#x2F;pls_path.hpp\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rive-app&#x2F;rive-renderer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;renderer...</a> )\n\nIt&#x27;s so insane they don&#x27;t offer any way to export movie files. The animation IDE is decent. Nowhere near as good as Flash was. But at least let me animate in it and export movie files.<p>It&#x27;s hilarious how so much new tech is just barely scratching the surface of what Flash offered in terms of a creative production tool. Every passive consumer fixates on Flash the plug-in and has no idea how incredible the tool was.\n\n  Their pricing page, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rive.app&#x2F;pricing</a> suggests that they support MP4&#x2F;GIF&#x2F;PNG Sequence and WebM exports?  Is that not what you&#x27;re looking for?\n\n    I believe its in reference to QuickTime File Format (.Mov files). The fact its not supported is odd and one of the reasons I have yet to try rive\n\n      If it can export to mp4 or a sequence of pngs what stops you from using ffmpeg to covert that to quicktime?\n\nHappy to see this!<p>Would love to see somebody try to re-implement some limited Canvas2D API but using Rive Renderer as a backend. Would likely be faster and more flexible in some ways (e.g. I&#x27;ve found that Canvas2D clipping is not anti-aliased in some browsers).\n\nSo does this mean someome can create a free editor I can use for basic animation that I don&#x27;t have to pay $25 for the rest of my life to use?<p>Edit* $39 per month if you don&#x27;t pay for an entire year in one go. Wtf haha, anyone actually paying this for basic solo-dev work?\n\n  We&#x27;ve really been spoiled by modern software competition.<p>Once upon a time middleware like this would have been &quot;Call Us&quot; with a custom 5 figure license and royalties.<p>Now it&#x27;s not even an hour of a single developer&#x27;s time cost per month and you get complaints.\n\n    Right? Also one &quot;hack&quot; I use quite a bit is to subscribe for when I need a tool and then unsubscribe when I don&#x27;t. I use privacy.com to create virtual credit cards that can only be charged once, or a certain amount, or for a certain period of time.<p>Of course you&#x27;ll need to backup your data, but  honestly that&#x27;s good practice anyway. I just search Google to ensure the service makes it easy to unsubscribe and easy to export your data.<p>Many projects have phases where you use certain tools extensively—no sense in continuing to pay for say an online video editor on the months you aren&#x27;t, well, editing any video.\n\n    It&#x27;s the market distortion created by people who work for free and expect to get stuff for free<p>It seems like OSS is more and more bigcorp making money anyway so probably that perception will keep shifting until we&#x27;re back to normal conditions and OSS developers will be able to earn a salary from their work.\n\n      Who said anything about free? Have you used Rive Designer? It&#x27;s $39 per month for a basic animation DCC tool, which is based online and your files are locked away so you can only alter them if you keep paying perpetually. For a solo developer doing basic animation now and then, the price is absolutely insane for the stuff you get out of it.\n\n    Wait until they find out how much compilers used to cost!\n\n      Surreal you&#x27;re comparing this to a compiler like its in any way comparable.\n\n        I didn&#x27;t compare it to a compiler.<p>I mentioned compilers used to cost money, and new programmers today might not even realize it.<p>Implying a good editor (aka Rive) might be worth paying for if it&#x27;s unique or early.\n\n    Lets say I wanted to make a simple ball bouncing animation using Rive for my app. That would take me around 8 minutes to make. Rive editor is an online tool so I&#x27;d have to pay $39 constantly to have access to it if I wanted to adjust it at some point as the data is stored online.<p>Lets say I wanted to create a more complex animation. That might take me 2 days. But I&#x27;ve been forced to pay for the entire month and I need to pay forver to have access to it if I cancel.\n\n      How long would it take you to implement the Rive rendering engine from a blank notepad?<p>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re paying $39 a month for.<p>Not too long ago people were paying $8500 per platform to play back static video. Or about 18 years of Rive access.\n\n  It seems to be just the very basement level of an open source Rive-type project. You would need to build the runtime around this renderer and then of course the authoring app. It would still be quite a lift, but hey, success does start with high-performance vectors.<p>More likely, I see perhaps other projects with vector-rendering needs (in-game UIs, video creation tools, svg tools, etc) perhaps studying or adopting the render to make their own graphics more performant.<p>But to answer your question on &quot;who pays for this?&quot; I can raise my hand and say &quot;I do!&quot; and it&#x27;s a great value. But just like Copilot probably isn&#x27;t the best monthly investment if you&#x27;re not doing quite a bit of coding, Rive probably isn&#x27;t the best investment if you aren&#x27;t doing quite a bit of animation.\n\n  &gt; Edit* $39 per month if you don&#x27;t pay for an entire year in one go. Wtf haha, anyone actually paying this for basic solo-dev work?<p>Out of curiosity, how much do <i>you</i> expect to make for your basic solo-dev work?<p>Very often I find that devs&#x27; attitude when it comes to their own work is &quot;I deserve a six figure salary&#x2F;equivalent sales&quot; but when it comes to other people&#x27;s work, that flips to &quot;software should be free&quot;. I have zero idea where the salaries are supposed to come from then.\n\n    The amount they are charging for this product has no relevance to the expected payout for any future basic solo work.<p>Lets say I wanted to make a simple ball bouncing animation using Rive for my app. That would take me around 8 minutes to make.

But I&#x27;ve been forced to pay for the entire month and I need to pay forver to have access to it if I cancel.\n\nIs there technical documentation to understand the method behind the engine? because at first sight it seems like the classic &quot;path flattening to polygon and then triangulation&quot; that has been used for 20+ years (at Mazatech our first AmanithVG on OpenGL used that technique) but I&#x27;m sure there is more than that on Rive renderer ...to be recognized as a such powerful engine.\n\nThis is really exciting to see for me personally.<p>I&#x27;ve been pushing over the past six months or so for multiple clients, from healthcare companies with basic mobile apps to deep gaming companies &#x2F; products, to adopt Rive over Lottie and other past solutions, as I think it&#x27;s finally hit its stride and is &quot;ready-for-adoption&quot;.<p>This was the last piece that came up in some of those discussions as a potential concern (latest renderer being &quot;closed source&quot; &#x2F; not quite final).<p>Really excited to see this problem space continue to improve thanks to this decision and the work the Rive team is doing in general (drop shadows, blur, etc. are all going to be very exciting as they ship)!\n\n  Maybe this is a basic question, but why?<p>Lottie is becoming fairly established as a file format and the workflow is well established and fairly simple.<p>What does Rive do significantly better warranting pushing for it?\n\n    yes and Lottie has Adobe After Effects as an editor. Is speed really that much better in Rive? Even if it is, maybe there would be a way to convert from a lottie file to a rive file&#x2F;format and vice versa\n\nWow. And MIT license. This is crazy impressive.\n\n  &gt; And MIT license.<p>For me, that’s very much the unimpressive part.\n\n    Why?\n\nSo I love Rive—the product and the company. And I love open source.<p>But this is an MIT license for Rive&#x27;s rendering abstraction layer, a subset of the Rive runtime that requires the Rive Editor to build content for.<p>I&#x27;m just curious about the goals for open sourcing this and what your hope and plan is for the larger community you&#x27;d like to build around it. Can you think of perhaps another project that would benefit from adopting just the renderer? Thanks!\n\n  Vector graphics do not require a special editor to be built.<p>Plenty of projects from games to UI toolkits need a vector graphics renderer, which is why libraries like Skia and Cairo (and now Rive&#x27;s) exist.\n\n    vector graphics != SVG<p>Vector graphics can absolutely require specialized editors to be built. SVG editors are an example of this.\n\n      I&#x27;m well aware that vector graphics doesn&#x27;t equal SVG. On the other hand, <i>you</i> seem to be conflating &quot;vector graphics file formats&quot; with &quot;vector graphics&quot;.\n\n  &quot;I&#x27;m just curious about the goals for open sourcing this&quot;<p>I suppose, continue to make money with the proprietary editor, but have an open source renderer to deploy and enable an ecosystem, where other people target this renderer, as it might be superior. I am definitely interested, I routinely hit the limit of 2D drawing with my limited 16ms per frame (currently I use the canvasAPI and pixi).\n\n  &gt; a subset of the Rive runtime that requires the Rive Editor to build content for<p>From github[0]: This repository contains the renderer code and an example for how to interface with it directly.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rive-app&#x2F;rive-renderer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rive-app&#x2F;rive-renderer</a>\n\n  It seems like a smart strategy of &quot;not becoming Macromedia Flash&quot;\n\nDoes anybody know what that figure on the home page is called? It’s sort of like a Lissajous plot but with extra wiggles.\n\nI like this a lot, but it represents a turning away from desktop technology (as in having a native editor as a desktop app) that just makes me say “no”.\n\n  Right. &quot;Available for iOS, Android and web&quot; ... if that&#x27;s the future, I don&#x27;t want to live in it (which is OK, because I won&#x27;t be).\n\n    Have my bitter sweet upvote.\n\n  It has an open-source format, you can create animations yourself as well. Plus this renderer is literally a desktop app, isn’t it? It is as cross platform as it gets, with this project being the most optimized implementation.\n\n    Just because it&#x27;s open source and I can create animations myself (by hand) doesn&#x27;t mean either solve the underlying problem that we are killing off desktop application technology.\n\n  You can also download some windows or apple binary. No idea if that is just a packed web browser, but even if, if it is fast, what is the problem?\n\n    Electrons gotten pretty good at the speed thing (or processing speeds caught up with it), but I can still feel the missing native elements and small touches that make native macOS apps a joy.\n\nHow does this renderer compare to Qt Quick&#x27;s renderer (if it&#x27;s at all a fair comparison)?\n\nBut can I export video assets with this!?  That&#x27;s my question - I&#x27;ve had to resort to WebGL for a lot of this so far.\n\nHow feasible is it to build web games with this? I’d like to build something with this treating it like you would Pixi.js, it looks to me like it’d be as performant if not better but with the amazing advantage of having a vector asset pipeline built into the system. Using vector graphics with Pixi, especially when rendering in a web worker, is a pain in the ass.\n\n  That was my question as well some weeks ago and my resume was, to wait a bit more. I could not find ressources on how to bind from the web at all, but maybe I missed it.<p>&quot;Using vector graphics with Pixi, especially when rendering in a web worker, is a pain in the ass.&quot;<p>Yes it is.\n\n    I currently load SVGs on the UI thread, draw them on a canvas, and then use `createImageBitmap()` to convert the canvas into an ImageBitmap, which I send back to the web worker. This method allows for scalable vector assets to be rasterized on-demand, even at high resolutions like retina, maintaining quality comparable to the browser&#x27;s rasterizer. Third-party libraries didn&#x27;t offer consistent or satisfactory results.\n\nThis problem seems to create a continuous stream of software attempting to solve it with no definitive solution.<p>It&#x27;s kind of strange, because there is a single objectively correct rendering for any vector graphics scene given a pixel sampling function and colorspace metric (the one where each output pixel&#x27;s value is the closest representable color to the convolution of that function with the scene, expressed as a function from R^2 to R and a linear color scheme respectively), and it seems like it would be achievable with GPU compute and some care with error bounds on either curve tessellation or numerical computation of the exact symbolic integrals of curves.<p>And it also seems easy to make such a solution have a tunable level of approximation to have faster rendering.\n\n  Sounds like you should write a vector graphics library.\n\n    <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;</a><p>:-)\n\n  I think you&#x27;ve got a point here. 2D rendering is reasonably well defined. The problem is the overwhelming complexity of the GPU ecosystem. If you just had a decent parallel computer, it wouldn&#x27;t be so hard. But instead you have to adapt your rendering logic to the particular combination of pile of hacks your GPU infrastructure supports, each having an exquisitely unique set of limitations and tradeoffs.<p>You&#x27;ll likely enjoy our upcoming GPU-friendly stroke expansion paper - the core of it is <i>exactly</i> numerical methods with error bounds for the exact symbolic integrals of (certain curvature metrics) of curves. And the code is in Vello main (shader&#x2F;flatten.wgsl) if you&#x27;re curious and want to look at it now.\n\n    I poked at this a few times over the years, think my initial intent was to add SVG textures to Blender.<p>What I always found is the &#x27;good&#x27; renderers were a small part of a massive project (totally impractical to add as a dependency) and the small, standalone ones weren&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;good&#x27;. I think I found one (nanoVG IIRC) that could have probably been beaten into submission with some hacking but that was around the same time I was winding down my involvement in Blender.<p>A quick peek at the code seem like this is exactly what I needed those 15 years ago and it just so happens I have some python bindings that could be easily be ported over to this if anyone is interested.\n\nThat&#x27;s exciting! Congrats on the release.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about rive but it looks like a better framer &#x2F; lottie.<p>Especially with an OSS renderer with an eye to performance.<p>I tried out the bevy integration (definitely the best implementation of ECS, anywhere) and there&#x27;s a working (still unmerged) fork but it&#x27;s still using vello.<p>Looking forward to see more!\n\nMan, I was literally at their booth in GDC 25 minutes ago.<p>Truthfully the program they have looks fantastic at empowering UI&#x2F;UX designers to do more with games.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if everyone is aware, but the normal flow is that a UI&#x2F;UX designer will spend days in Figma; give the output to a programmer and the programmer will (often) say that it&#x27;s impossible to implement for X,Y reason.<p>What follows is a back and forth between the programmer and the designer until eventually a design exists that can be implemented.<p>This is compounded by the fact that there&#x27;s no <i>good</i> UI framework in Unreal engine, at least not for AAA games.<p>So, while I have not done a feasibility test yet, the workflow of this tool is definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen and seems to integrate seamlessly with Unreal Engine and blueprints.<p>I&#x27;m personally really excited, because with this it&#x27;s possible for a UI&#x2F;UX designer to work without the aid of a programmer.<p>(also, game programmers tend to hate doing UI).\n\n  i&#x27;ve often thought that if i were a UI&#x2F;UX designer, i would want to work in games. most productivity software already has deep-rooted paradigms and abstractions, and attempting to challenge any of these results in grumbling users. in video games, however, a novel UI&#x2F;UX decision is usually met with curiosity rather than irritation. presumably this can be ascribed to the user&#x27;s frame of mind when they sit down to do work versus play a game.\n\n    This would depend, I reckon, on whether ones emphasis was on user experience or user interaction.<p>Games are great for user experience, because gamers are, by definition, looking for an experience. They aren&#x27;t there to get work done, they want to have fun. So a fun interaction paradigm, with creative visuals, sound effects, various game-related skeuomorphisms: all of that is what they want.<p>User interaction, on the other hand, is about keeping the software from standing between the user and what the user wants to do. A large part of this job is insisting that developers don&#x27;t do surprising things, but rather, stay within the lanes of expected interactions for the platform. There&#x27;s room for creativity and novelty, but the budget for those must be spent carefully.\n\n  Agree that design&lt;-&gt;programming handoff is tedious but curious where you think UMG is lacking. I’ve found it pretty fun to implement UI in once I got the hang of it.\n\n  It&#x27;s unfortunate that Unreal Engine is so bad at UI&#x2F;UX these days. I was playing UT99 with some friends the other day and was struck by just how powerful, intuitive, and flexible it&#x27;s UI&#x2F;UX was, both in-game and through all the configuration&#x2F;server browser&#x2F;etc. menus. It&#x27;s one of the first times I&#x27;ve really like like an old man yelling about how the modern equivalent of things is so awful.\n\n    It&#x27;s certainly not <i>worse</i> at authoring smooth UIs, it&#x27;s just not aaaaalll that much better. While UMG-- UE&#x27;s 2D toolkit-- has lagged other parts of UE by a lot, it&#x27;s still way easier to get precise visual results for your UI than in most native UI toolkits, even if it&#x27;s less mature than, say, CSS. That said, given how elegantly things like 3d collisions are handled in UE, it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous that you can&#x27;t have, say, convex hit boxes for buttons in UMG.\n\nIs there no Linux support for the editor? I only see libraries for various platforms.\n\nIs it significant that the renderer is open-source when you need their paid products to create content for it?"

      "conversation_text": "A friend of mine from a farming family in Europe once told me a story that his family would wait until the year one of his siblings was due to go to college and then invest in new farm machinery. Their reported net income for the year would reduce or go negative and the sibling would get to college effectively for free on a hardship tuition grant.\n\n  Yep very common tactic for small business owning families.\n\n  At least in America, they usually look at the past 2-5 years of income to avoid these types of shenanigans.\n\n    In Canada, they use gross income instead of net income for student grants.\n\n      So, what happens if you work in an area where the cost are high but the margin is low? You might make $100K but have $85K in costs. You still have $15K in income. Does this apply to those self employed or only wage earners (gets a paycheck)?\n\n    In Austria, we just don&#x27;t have tuition fees, which also avoids these types of shenanigans :)\n\n  Huh? Wouldn&#x27;t they have to depreciate it over several years so only a fraction of it would be a deduction in the current?  Or is the idea that they&#x27;d buy so much capital equipment that even the fraction they could depreciate that year would wipe out all the other income?<p>AIUI, the concept of depreciation exists in tax law precisely to prevent indefinitely deferring taxes via reinvestment (though it can&#x27;t do anything about the portion of reinvestment going to pay salaries a la Amazon):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15061439\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15061439</a>\n\n    Many countries allow accelerated deprecation of designated equipment.<p>Here&#x27;s the IRS&#x27;s - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;additional-first-year-depreciation-deduction-bonus-faq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;additional-first-year-depreciat...</a>\n\n&gt; The following histograms of Russian elections across polling stations shows curious spikes in turnout and results at nice, round, numbers (e.g., 95%) starting around 2004. This appears to indicate that there&#x27;s election fraud via fabricated results<p>Two observations:\n1. Why from 2004? Things were much worse in Russia before 2004.\n2. The numbers of this election seem to agree with approval rating polls conducted by western agencies.\n\n  By 2004, a former KGB spook was in power long enough to introduce a falsification system.<p>The 1990s were worse <i>economically</i> in Russia, but Yeltsin was a relatively liberal politician and possibly didn&#x27;t <i>want</i> to falsify elections.\n\n    I am not sure.\nYeltsin was “our guy”. He was feted by us, he even addressed  the congress, etc. Until he was not when he refused to deliver Russia on a plate.<p>Guys that are not “our guys” never win a legitimate election. Remember how integrity of elections were questioned when a guy that is not our guy won an election in 2016?\n\n      I am far from sure either, but Yeltsin had some &quot;street cred&quot; speaking for him. I remember the 1990s quite well, being a teenager with intense interest in politics.<p>He got to power by organizing a folk uprising against an attempted coup by KGB generals Kryuchkov et al., who were hardliners and quite skilled people as well; they caught Gorbachev and held him hostage.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1991_Soviet_coup_attempt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1991_Soviet_coup_attempt</a><p>That coup could very well succeed and that would mean death for Yeltsin, possibly after a torture session in Lubyanka. He certainly demonstrated personal courage there.<p>What followed was &quot;too free Russia&quot;. As in, lawless. It had certain advantages. For the first time in Russian history ever, multiple independent media sprang from the ground and journalists would criticize and attack powerful figures in a way that they no longer can; we&#x27;re used to it, but open media criticism of powerful people is actually not that typical in the world. But at the same time, crooks stole everything and the regular Russian suffered. As a nasty consequence, democracy and freedom became one with poverty and corruption in minds of many Russians.<p>Yeltsin only contested one election, in 1996. His opponent Zyuganov was a classical communist. The result was 54.40% for Yeltsin and 40.73% for Zyuganov. Was this election clean? How can I know? But it wasn&#x27;t a travesty with 90 per cent for The Leader and paper figures for &quot;opponents&quot;; Zyuganov was a real politician with a competing party and a very different program, and he got 40 per cent of the vote, and nobody fell out of the window etc.<p>Everything is relative, and I believe that for the standards of Russia, Yeltsin was by far the most liberal leader in its history.\n\n        Good points.<p>It didn’t matter that Yeltsin was the most liberal of all. He did not roll over and play dead for NATO expansion and balkanisation projects. So he became a pariah overnight and was painted as an alcoholic and corrupt.\n\n  2004 was the first election after the dictator took office and decided he would never leave. (He pretended to leave once, installing a puppet for 1 term, due to Constitutional limits. When he officially returned, he amended the Constitution to make himself dictator for life.) He&#x27;s still dictator 20 years later.\n\nHaha, I recall seeing a similar plot with a &quot;suspicious discontinuity&quot; when I looked up data on home appraisal price vs sale price. I remember asking the loan officer why the contract was forwarded to the appraiser before they did the appraisal, because that might bias their assessment. She gave me a funny look and replied &quot;that&#x27;s kind of the point.&quot;\n\n  Yeah of course, the appraiser is a person who is paid to write down the predetermined number. The US federal government should nuke this industry as part of their crackdown on &quot;junk fees&quot;. Either the appraiser serves a legitimate arms-length purpose or their whole line of business should go away.\n\n    I could see a third option as a &quot;lemon detector&quot;. That is, instead of their output being a number, it would be a binary, intended only to limit downside risk in the worst cases.<p>I think in practice this is indeed the role they play. If I&#x27;m &quot;overpaying&quot; by 20%, the appraiser will probably still &quot;write down the predetermined number&quot;, but if I&#x27;m overpaying by 100% and taking out a mortgage to do it, there&#x27;s a pretty good chance that the bank&#x27;s appraiser is going to sink that deal.\n\n      That&#x27;s basically what they do, they&#x27;re not to find the actual value of the property (that&#x27;s more properly a tax assessor, perhaps) - they are there to make sure the valuation is &quot;in the ballpark&quot; to what it would liquidate for.<p>An appraiser will never get in trouble if a bank forecloses on a $500k property and it sells for $450k or so, but they will get in trouble if the $500k property only sells for $200k - they&#x27;d need to explain why.\n\n    I think it&#x27;s really a problem of different incentives.<p>Somebody (A) at the bank does not want to give out loans that are well beyond a properties value.<p>Somebody (B) _else_ at the bank is actually the one giving you the loan and makes money from you getting it.<p>So A requires B to have an appraiser so they can&#x27;t completely run away writing loans. From talking to some real estate agents, the appraiser will only fudge so much for you. An appraiser might agree that the house is worth 750k even if they actually think its 699k but if you try to get a 700k loan for a 350k house they&#x27;ll write down 350k in their appraisal.<p>--<p>IIRC, the government&#x27;s crack down on &quot;junk fees&quot; is mostly that you can&#x27;t advertise a price and then inflate it later with fees. So as long as the bank states that they require an appraiser and their in-house cost is $X; it doesn&#x27;t count as a junk fee. But if the bank says that the loan is going to cost say $5k in overhead and then later says it doesn&#x27;t include appraisal fee then it be a junk fee.\n\n      &gt; An appraiser might agree that the house is worth 750k even if they actually think its 699k but if you try to get a 700k loan for a 350k house they&#x27;ll write down 350k in their appraisal.<p>This is kind of the point. The appraiser isn&#x27;t trying to find the &quot;true value&quot; of the house, otherwise buyers would hire appraisers prior to even offering a bid.<p>The question that the bank wants answered is, &quot;is this house sufficiently matched to loan amount such that if the borrower defaults, the house can be sold for enough money to recoup the loan?&quot;<p>And if the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then they write down the number.\n\n    Semi-related: the time an appraiser raised the estimated value after the couple removed all traces of the place being inhabited by black people:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstcoastnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;jacksonville-couple-sees-home-appraisal-jump-40-percent-after-they-remove-all-traces-of-blackness&#x2F;77-c3087e8c-0c65-4fb9-8319-da82f5c0ea20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstcoastnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;jacksonvil...</a><p>Reddit &#x2F;r&#x2F;nottheonion discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nottheonion&#x2F;comments&#x2F;igk83g&#x2F;jacksonville_couple_sees_home_appraisal_jump_40&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nottheonion&#x2F;comments&#x2F;igk83g&#x2F;jackson...</a>\n\n    Appraisals function as a major fraud reducer, especially for internal fraud.<p>Appraisers will fudge $100k on the value of a $1m house because that&#x27;s their opinion as an appraiser. They won&#x27;t fudge $1m on the exact same house (2x value).<p>That serves as a kind of cap on funny business to some extent. 10% of the value isn&#x27;t going to make that much difference on the ability to pay for most borrowers so an excess $100k in the valuation doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> matter anyway. As long as appraisals don&#x27;t get too out of line they serve their purpose.\n\n  When I was selling, I must&#x27;ve gotten the only appraiser in the world that actually appraises rather than just follows the contract. Idiot lost me $15k on my house.<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s _very_ clear their appraisal, which is usually _dead on_ with the offer, is a sham. I mean, even just considering the incentive structure (Who&#x27;s going to hire an appraiser who causes deals to go sideways?), it&#x27;s clear that they&#x27;re just a middleman taking their cut.\n\n  Appraisals are such a joke. We had an appraiser say that my new construction was going to appraise at $100k under cost -- so my broker fired him, ate the fee, and  hired an old friend of his instead. She gave us the number we needed and the deal closed.<p>Then again, the finished house then appraised at $50k _over_ cost 12 months later when I converted the construction loan, so maybe the first appraiser really was nuts.\n\nSimilar to car prices, we see the same mental rounding effect in rents. People will rent a home for $2100 or $2200, sometimes even $2150 for those truly dedicated to price finding, but hardly anyone rents an apartment for $2137.<p>Source: my data for the city of Berkeley <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@jwb&#x2F;berkeley-rent-board-data#cell-454\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@jwb&#x2F;berkeley-rent-board-data#cell-...</a>\n\n  The car pricing seems to be that some amount of people round 79,999 down to 70,000 when determining mileage and so cars with 79,999km on the odometer are penalised much less than cars with 80,000km.<p>I think the rent one is much more driven by &quot;some landlords like round numbers for posting ads&#x2F;doing their finances&quot;.\n\n    The &quot;round prices&quot; is definitely a factor, the math may say to rent for $2134 but the landlord will either round that down to $2100 or up to $2200.<p>And unless increases are limited by some law, they will usually only raise it by even amounts.\n\n    This is the same reason grocery store prices are $x.99, people anchor on the first digit and $5.99 feels like a lot less than $6.00\n\n  You might get some of that if rent is raised by percentage.  When I started my current job my salary was an integer multiple of $10,000.  I got a raise at the end of my first year that was an integer percentage (3%, IIRC) so my salary was then an integer multiple of $100.  The following year I got a raise again (it might have been an integer percentage, I don&#x27;t recall) and my salary was just some random-looking integer.<p>Rent-controlled Berkeley apartments are allowed to increase rent by some fixed percentage, so maybe you can see this in your data?  But I don&#x27;t think the math would work out so cleanly.\n\n    Very true, but the graph I posted is initial leases only.\n\n      I see you said that in your link.  Maybe I should read more carefully before making comments.\n\n        Reading any part of it launches you into the top percentile already.\n\nI went to school at a relatively late age and started in community college. The school&#x2F;state had a policy where any independent income earners making less than 35,000&#x2F;year would not pay tuition. A single dollar over that would require paying full tuition of ~$60&#x2F;unit or about $750 a semester. One year I worked a little more overtime during the holidays than usual and realized with a week to go in the year that I&#x27;d go a few hundred dollars over, so I called out of a few shifts and nearly got fired over it. I barely squeaked in under the limit, and if I hadn&#x27;t, there was pretty much no way I would have been able to continue school. It&#x27;s not like I could suddenly afford it now that I made $35,001 vs $34,999. I have never understood why things like this don&#x27;t use some sort of sliding scale, rather than absolute dividing line.\n\n  An instructive image of the welfare trap: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Welfare_trap.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Welfare_trap.png</a><p>People making $30K on welfare would need to make $81K at an actual job to have the same income after tax.<p>More info: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Welfare_trap\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Welfare_trap</a>\n\n    Something seems very off with that image. I&#x27;ve known a lot of different people who were on welfare over the years, and not one of them had a standard of living anywhere close to what someone who nets $60,000 a year does. That said, there is absolutely a cliff where you could risk a loss just by taking in more money.\n\n      The main feature of that image is &quot;childcare&quot; which seems to be a fixed subsidy of $16k (and &quot;CHIP&quot;, ~$4k related to child health care).<p>I don&#x27;t know what the former means and how these are calculated, but if you don&#x27;t have children, this graph would look a lot less exciting.\n\n        The ones I&#x27;ve known with kids all seem to have it far worse. If they were getting a $16k tax credit or whatever it must not have been making up for the other costs involved with raising children.\n\n          That graph is also showing an <i>ideal</i> situation—that is, you fully qualify for <i>and</i> fully receive all of the benefits listed.<p>That means you have to also know that you qualify for them, apply for them, prove that you qualify, oh, nope, whoops, you missed one piece of proof there—that means you have to start all over.<p>You have to apply for each one, prove that you qualify, jump through all the hoops, you start receiving benefits! Now it&#x27;s time to apply for the next one, get the <i>slightly different</i> proofs together, send them all in—oh, what&#x27;s that? someone gave you just enough money that you went over one of the limits? you get nothing this year!<p>A new year, you have to apply for each one, prove that you qualify....\n\n            So, are you going to go for that 14th job interview, or are you going to go spend four hours making sure you have childcare next month? Do you finish the online test, or do you fill out the form on the benefits website for the fifth time this month?\n\n            In my cab driving days I hauled around a bunch of people to&#x2F;from medical appointments and they talk on the phone a lot...<p>Some people are absolute experts at navigating the bureaucracy to the point I expect they know the rules better than the people that work at the various government agencies. It was quite impressive to be honest.<p>One example off the top of my head; this lady was talking on the phone with a friend (or whoever) explaining how their benefits would be impacted if they declared the father of the children resided in the household and how it was much better to just lie and claim to be a single mother.<p>No judgement from me as it was quite the education on governmental programs.<p>As an added bonus I also learned a bunch of methods on how to steal groceries from walmart since people are surprisingly candid on these things when they&#x27;re just having a conversation with some random cab driver they probably won&#x27;t ever see again.\n\n              If you&#x27;ve got the mental bandwidth and dedication to learn these kinds of things, it <i>can</i> be very impressive. This is obviously a much less dramatic example, but when my wife worked for a costume wholesaler over a decade ago, she had to learn how customs regulations worked in order to design costumes that would be able to be imported without the higher duty associated with &quot;wearable garments&quot;, and by the time she left that job, she knew the regulations better than at least some of the customs agents she had to interact with.<p>I have great respect for people who can learn to navigate government bureaucracies well enough to avoid getting caught up on all the deliberate snares and thorns—all the moreso if they can do so while also being poor, working 3 jobs, raising kids as a single parent, etc.\n\n                &gt; I have great respect for people who can learn to navigate government bureaucracies well enough to avoid getting caught up on all the deliberate snares and thorns—all the moreso if they can do so while also being poor, working 3 jobs, raising kids as a single parent, etc.<p>Yes, the latter is a very peculiar combination, because not many people with the mental skills required to navigate a bureaucracy like that stay poor (because some employers are willing to pay a lot for those skills).<p>Or to flip the statement: in order to fully benefit from the programs designed to help poor people, you need skills that few poor people have.<p>(Of course, this is all about averages and aggregates.  There are certainly people who manage to be both poor and have the skills and mentality required to navigate the bureaucracy.)<p>My &#x27;flipped&#x27; statement is one of the best arguments for a UBI-style simplification of means testing that I know of.\n\n                  &gt; Yes, the latter is a very peculiar combination, because not many people with the mental skills required to navigate a bureaucracy like that stay poor (because some employers are willing to pay a lot for those skills).<p>Whooo boy that&#x27;s a lot of assumptions there.<p>Sorry, but it just doesn&#x27;t hold up in practice. If you&#x27;re working at McDonald&#x27;s, your employer has very little interest in your ability to navigate a complex bureaucracy. Especially when the manager is the manager because he&#x27;s the franchise owner&#x27;s nephew.<p>Unfortunately, in most low-level jobs, that kind of skill—and, more importantly, the initiative required to obtain the skill—is not only not valued, it is <i>punished</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a number of people I know who are <i>very</i> bright, <i>very</i> talented people stuck in low-end jobs for exactly those reasons. (Plus the good old standbys of &quot;can&#x27;t take time off to do job interviews, too exhausted each night to spend hours sending out applications&quot;, etc.)\n\n          16k wouldn&#x27;t cover daycare in much of the US let alone food, clothes, etc.\n\n            What are you imagining the typical rate is in much of America. When we lived in the city we had a range of about 225 to 300 per week as of last year. Outside of the city we pay 160 per week.<p>The real issue was the waiting list…\n\n              Lol, over 400&#x2F;week is standard in eastern PA, US. Many daycares sampled in our search. Medium cost of living suburban area.<p>Also over 1 year wait list.\n\n              If you have a wait list, the price isn&#x27;t high enough\n\n                Or maybe you value the consistency of full enrollment that comes with a waitlist over the additional revenue you could earn with higher prices. Could be the case if there are high costs to changing the size of the business.<p>Imagine there’s a law that you can only have 4 children per caregiver. Your capacity is 8. Lose one and your revenue is down 12.5%\n\n                A good example of where free market ideology falls flat\n\n                  How so?  This doesn&#x27;t have much to do with a free market.<p>The same applies if eg the government provides a service for a fee, or otherwise gates access to something.  Eg H-1B visas to the US should arguably be auctioned off.\n\n                  You can&#x27;t criticise free markets where there is no market, let alone a free one.<p>&quot;Supply and demand&quot; is not a free market claim, it is accepted by everyone.<p>I&#x27;m just pointing out that the NHS exchanges monetary cost with temporal cost - you&#x27;re paying with your time rather than your dollars, for access. You&#x27;re also paying dollars via tax, but that&#x27;s unrelated to access.<p>A nation can accept or even demand this trade-off, and many do - but support tends to drop when it is made explicit.\n\n              You are a lucky person. I just looked up my tax statements for 2022 and I paid $1341.67&#x2F;month for an older kid (not infant). Waiting lists are atrocious and everywhere (and many places charge a $75-150 deposit for the waiting list alone); we got in fast because it was a new location. I am in the Midwest, not a coast.\n\n          &gt; The ones I&#x27;ve known with kids all seem to have it far worse. If they were getting a $16k tax credit or whatever it must not have been making up for the other costs involved with raising children.<p>Worse than someone who doesn&#x27;t have to pay raise a kid isn&#x27;t the same thing as worse than someone else with kids who makes $8000 more and therefore loses the $16,000 credit.<p>And the cliffs are only half the problem. Did you get a childcare subsidy? Only if you use approved providers, which charge more than your older niece would to watch the kids, and now the money goes to some bureaucratic corporation with lawyers and lobbyists instead of your own family, and you see your niece less often and don&#x27;t talk to her dad as much and now he&#x27;s less likely to offer to do you a favor when you need one or realize that you do.<p>You also get a housing subsidy, but only for particular housing, which isn&#x27;t as close to your job or doesn&#x27;t allow you to pool resources with roommates, so now you have to pay more for transportation or most of the subsidy gets eaten by higher rents etc.<p>The entire welfare system should be vaporized and replaced with a tax credit for the poor (i.e. a UBI).\n\n            &gt; The entire welfare system should be vaporized and replaced with a tax credit for the poor (i.e. a UBI).<p>Yep, call it a negative income tax if it goes down better than UBI, but many other things would be better than the system we have now.\n\n              The problem with UBI isn&#x27;t so much the politics, it&#x27;s the feasibility of the cost. $12k a year over 300 million people is 80% of the US government&#x27;s tax revenue.<p>A negative income tax might work out a lot better on the numbers, but it won&#x27;t help the people that need it the most (the ones that can&#x27;t get a job).<p>But hey, maybe it can work. The US has a deficit spending of $1.7 trillion in 2023, $1.4 in 2022, $2.7 in 2021. That $1.7 would cover almost half of a $12k ubi. But how long could that last?\n\n                This is nonsensical for numerous reasons<p>1. The federal government doesn&#x27;t have tax revenue. It issues a currency and then taxes go toward countering inflation. The notion that a currency-issuing government needs to &quot;balance its budget&quot; in its own currency is a political fiction. Also, policies that benefit people at the lower end of the income spectrum disproportionately actually move money around in the economy, which generally speaking is less inflationary than allowing it to accumulate in various silos like hedge funds<p>2. A &quot;negative income tax&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to require employment. You can make zero dollars in income as a self-employed person, and the self-employed still track their income for taxation purposes<p>3. There are many unnecessary-to-malicious subsidies and inefficient welfare programs that could easily have their rationale subsumed by UBI, and doing so would save considerable cost that is mostly the overhead of all the means-testing personnel and in some cases (like SNAP) completely separate financial machinery necessary to maintain them<p>Even setting all that aside, you could make considerably more &quot;tax revenue&quot; by funding the IRS or reversing some of the nakedly corrupt corporate tax breaks that have been created over the last several decades. There always seems to be more money to subsidize artificially lowering the price of certain goods, fund incredibly inefficient private government contractors to do things that once cost considerably less for the government to do itself, fund drug research only to then allow the resulting breakthroughs to be patented by a private firm and then gouge people for treatment, or buy ludicrously expensive weapons for militarized police forces, but propose anything that actually benefits people and suddenly everyone&#x27;s worried about the costs.<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but all this &quot;Well have you considered the cost?&quot; handwringing people do when UBI comes up just drastically misunderstands how governments use money, while claiming to be &quot;responsible&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot;\n\n                  Your point (1) sounds like the same old &#x27;modern monetary theory&#x27; that never amounted to anything.  To quip, MMT is both novel and correct.  It has both novel and correct parts (but no parts that are both).<p>See eg <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econlib.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;Columns&#x2F;y2021&#x2F;SumnermodernmonetarytheoryPartI.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econlib.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;Columns&#x2F;y2021&#x2F;Sumnermodernmo...</a>\n\n                  &gt; you could make considerably more &quot;tax revenue&quot; by funding the IRS<p>The US government expenditure as percentage of GDP is now over one-third, as opposed to the pre-WW1 long-term average in the single digits. Keep in mind that massive infrastructure projects like the Transcontinental Railroad were able to be built in those single-digit percent times, or that US educational spending per pupil has been going up year after year for decades yet student achievement flatlined, and of recent years been trending down. Clearly, more tax revenue is neither necessary nor sufficient for the public good.<p>&gt; reversing some of the nakedly corrupt corporate tax breaks<p>No arguments from me there.<p>&gt; fund drug research only to then allow the resulting breakthroughs to be patented by a private firm and then gouge people for treatment<p>Fundamental research and bringing a drug to market are markedly different areas that require very different skills and incentives. An organization that is good at one is not necessarily good at the other. And this isn&#x27;t confined to drug research; an architect can draw up plans for a house, but a family cannot live in a plan. Foundations need to be poured, chalk lines snapped, lumber nailed together, and plumbing and wires laid, all in the context of a competitive marketplace.\n\n                    I attribute a lot of the higher expenditure and lower efficiency to the continued insistence that outsourcing to contractors, effectively picking winners in a &quot;market&quot; to give monopoly status, is a better way to provide government services. These firms have little if any accountability to the electorate, no incentive to set reasonable prices, get anything done efficiently, and in some cases don&#x27;t even produce working services<p>Similarly, bringing a drug to market with a patent is not a competitive marketplace, by design, and it consistently creates an outcome wherein people are charged exorbitant sums of money because of this non-competitive market. Doing a bunch of government-backed R&amp;D and then getting a patent for it is the government picking a winner, not creating a market<p>Basically, it seems like the government was and remains a lot more efficient when it directly builds the capacity to provide goods and services it determines to have an interest in providing, rather than try to do this through &quot;the market&quot; (again, this is almost never an actual market)\n\n                      &gt; outsourcing to contractors, effectively picking winners in a &quot;market&quot; to give monopoly status<p>In principle this is supposed to be a competitive bidding process, and then the winner is chosen by the most competitive bid rather than the government. In practice the process is corrupt and regulatory barriers are created to prevent smaller companies from submitting bids or project requirements are set such that only one company can satisfy them.<p>The problem here is corruption, which has nothing to do with whether the corrupting entity is a corporation. Public sector unions lobby for the same kind of labor-inefficient practices because they know that more jobs give them more members which give them more power, even (or especially) when the jobs are unnecessary or inefficient.<p>The advantage that existed pre-WWII is that neither large government contractors nor large public sector unions already existed in order to lobby for corrupt practices and their continued existence, so the government could just pay someone to do work and then have them to return to the private sector when the work is done. But WWII created such a large apparatus dependent on taxpayer revenue that it had enough lobbying power to sustain its continued existence, and now it needs to be disassembled before we can have nice things again.<p>But probably the best way to do it is under anti-corruption. You still want roads and ships to be built, but if you could get the corruption out of the bidding process then they&#x27;d be built by smaller and less consolidated companies with less individual lobbying power, and then you could address efficiency issues without having to fight a multi-billion dollar corporation or huge public sector union because that inefficiency is their profit margin&#x2F;job. Another possibility would be anti-trust -- break the big government contractors up.\n\n                        No, the problem would exist even if the bidding process was completely fair, because it still creates a situation where a long-standing project creates stable returns for a company while decoupling the service it provides from both market forces and public accountability. It is the worst of both worlds: shielded from market forces by having its customer be the government, providing a government service shielded from public accountability by the corporate veil<p>Yes, we should reduce corruption and break up existing entrenched players, but the core issue is in the structure of that kind of arrangement. I do also think that there&#x27;s no good reason to have a &quot;corporate veil&quot; in the first place, but that&#x27;s a broader problem\n\n                          &gt; it still creates a situation where a long-standing project creates stable returns for a company while decoupling the service it provides from both market forces and public accountability.<p>But that&#x27;s just a mechanism for the corruption. The contract for the design of something and its manufacture and maintenance should each be separate bids. Even each <i>stage</i> of the design should be a separate contract that could go to someone else. The government says &quot;we need a design for a ship&quot; and they put it out to firms who submit their proposals and then the government picks one and buys it outright. Then they say &quot;we need a design for a propulsion system for this ship&quot; and take bids again. If you need to modify the ship&#x27;s design some to facilitate it, that&#x27;s fine, because none have been built yet and the necessary change gets incorporated into the design before you put out contracts to build any of it.<p>What you want is for each of the contracts to be as small as practicable, to maximize the number of potential bidders. None of this &quot;single contract to design and build an entire fleet of ships and maintain them for 30 years&quot; nonsense.\n\n                            Yea, that does seem like a reasonable way to design less corrupt mechanisms for these processes, but I think the standard way piecemeal designs like that get rejected is by arguments to &quot;efficiency&quot; (Nevermind that efficiencies gained by bundling require some pretty strict discipline within a firm, mostly benefit the firm, and are easily dwarfed from the government&#x27;s perspective by the inefficiencies taken on by the problem we&#x27;re talking about)\n\n                              That&#x27;s the &quot;monopolies are efficient&quot; argument. Look, see, they can amortize their fixed costs over so many more units if they have the whole market.<p>Claims that you can increase the efficiency of a system by reducing competition should be met with the same level of skepticism as claims that you can violate of the second law of thermodynamics.<p>But let&#x27;s try one that should get their ears to perk up. Monopoly suppliers are systemic risk, which is a threat to national security.\n\n                  Actually most of the money is created as debt. Lincoln and JFK both issued &#x27;Green backs&#x27;, money not created via debt issues. But neither lived too long\n\n                  &gt; <i>fund drug research only to then allow the resulting breakthroughs to be patented by a private firm</i><p>Governments should be paid royalties for the patents (and other IP) they issue and protect.<p>For IP subsidized with public money, maybe auction off those rights.\n\n                The cost is fiction because it&#x27;s a tax credit. The money is on both sides of the ledger. If you&#x27;re making $60,000&#x2F;year and your pre-credit taxes go up by $12,000 and then you get a $12,000 tax credit, you have paid an additional zero dollars in taxes. If you don&#x27;t make much money and the government used to pay you a net $10,000 in benefits and now you get a $12,000 UBI and pay $2000 in taxes, that hasn&#x27;t actually cost any additional money, all it does is convert the needlessly inefficient constellation of benefits into cash.<p>The &quot;universal&quot; part of a UBI is serving the same purpose as the progressive rate structure in the income tax, i.e. you want an effective rate curve which is higher for the rich than the poor. Which means that you don&#x27;t need both. What you use instead is a flat tax rate which serves as the de facto &quot;phase out&quot; for the UBI. Except that because it&#x27;s all in one place, there are no cliffs, and there are no poor people paying higher de facto marginal rates than rich people, and there are no mountains of paperwork to apply for benefits.\n\n                  &gt; The cost is fiction because it&#x27;s a tax credit. The money is on both sides of the ledger. If you&#x27;re making $60,000&#x2F;year and your pre-credit taxes go up by $12,000 and then you get a $12,000 tax credit, you have paid an additional zero dollars in taxes.<p>Yes, but marginal rates are important, too.\n\n                    Most people miss that the &#x27;money&#x27; will get spent. This should lead to an income multiplier. Then hopefully to a reallocation of resources moving bureaucrats from administrative work to something else.\n\n                      (Fiscal) income multipliers don&#x27;t really exist (ie they are one) in an economy with a competent central bank that targets eg inflation or nominal GDP.<p>If whatever fiscal policy you have makes overall nominal spending go up (or down), that would have an impact on inflation, so the central bank will remove money from circulation (or add money to circulation) to counteract.<p>Thus neutralising any multiplier, you might naively expect.<p>(Also keep in mind that when you don&#x27;t tax some money, it also gets spend or invested etc.)\n\n                    &gt; Yes, but marginal rates are important, too.<p>Which is exactly the point. What&#x27;s the &quot;marginal tax rate&quot; on low and middle income people of the existing benefits phase outs?<p>The &gt;100% marginal rates that create actual cliffs are so patently absurd that no one can look at them and find any way to justify it, but even when the combined tax+phase out rates are in the neighborhood of 80-90% of marginal income, that&#x27;s still not what we want, is it?\n\n                      Yes, you need to look at the combined effective marginal rates.  That&#x27;s what a lot of the discussions around UBI and welfare etc neglects.\n\n            &gt; You also get a housing subsidy, but only for particular housing, which isn&#x27;t as close to your job or doesn&#x27;t allow you to pool resources with roommates, so now you have to pay more for transportation or most of the subsidy gets eaten by higher rents etc.<p>Yeah the subsidies also will not cover the entire cost of housing. So you probably have to drive a lot farther than someone else who is not using welfare to pay for the same kind of housing.<p>A lot of welfare stuff looks like a great deal when you put an amount on it but completely falls apart when you look at how challenging it is to access and what the conditions are around continuing in the program. It gets to the degree that getting that extra $40-50k a year requires you to give up a LOT. And it&#x27;s a full time job to maintain. So you have to do all of that on top of your full time job, often with agencies who have no hours after work. And god help you if you have to show up somewhere regularly to pick something up.<p>As a bonus nuking welfare and replacing it with UBI would help a lot of the chronically homeless because it would allow them to get assistance without needing to have a permanent physical address.\n\n              &gt; It gets to the degree that getting that extra $40-50k a year requires you to give up a LOT.<p>And it&#x27;s still costing the taxpayer ~$45k -- more than that, because the government has its own administrative overhead on top of that.<p>But people still use it, because they&#x27;re doing $30k in work to get $45k in benefits, it&#x27;s just that they were supposed to be getting $45k in benefits. Which the taxpayer is still paying for even though the net benefit is far less.<p>The people asking how to pay for it haven&#x27;t understood the math. If you subtract both the government&#x27;s administrative overhead and the recipient&#x27;s, we could provide a <i>higher</i> level of true benefits to people and still <i>lower</i> taxes on everyone else, just by splitting the efficiency gains between them.\n\n          In my Midwestern area, infant care is ~$2000&#x2F;month or more at a center and you get down to ~$1200 a month if you&#x27;re at the right kind of center by age 4. So there are still some thousands to contribute to childcare even with $16k &quot;off&quot; and then that doesn&#x27;t count diapers or clothes or formula (breastfeeding is great but you can&#x27;t do it forever, some can&#x27;t do it at all, and it is very hard to do on a practical level if you&#x27;ve got an hourly&#x2F;service job).\n\n        The chart (2012) is from Gary Alexander, Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Public Welfare - so take note the commenters who are trying to suggest this is libertarian propaganda.<p>Pennsylvania has a substantial program to pay for child care for many of its residents: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.pa.gov&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Children&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;Child-Care-Works-Program.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.pa.gov&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Children&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;Child-Care-Wo...</a>\n\n          It is not: it&#x27;s inspired by it.<p>If you look carefully, the numbers are different.

Rationally, no.\n\n          &gt; The chart (2012) is from Gary Alexander, Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Public Welfare - so take note the commenters who are trying to suggest this is libertarian propaganda.<p>In fairness, the linked image is sourced to a libertarian&#x27;s blog and Gary Alexander is also a conservative who was appointed to Corbett&#x27;s administration and was often criticized for extensive cuts to Pennsylvania’s welfare programs which he characterized as fighting fraud and waste until he resigned after a few scandals (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonexaminer.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2380594&#x2F;ex-pennsylvania-lawmaker-to-lead-corbetts-welfare-agency&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonexaminer.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2380594&#x2F;ex-penns...</a>) including the fact that he was still living in Rhode Island and was charging tax payers for his travel&#x2F;commute expenses.\n\n        CHIP -&gt; Child Health Insurance Program.\n\n      Well, this is well outside of my area of expertise, but the only factual dispute attached to the image in wikipedia is that SSI is only available to people essentially assumed to be out of the work pool. From the SSI site: &quot;Little or no income, and Little or no resources, and A disability, blindness, or are age 65 or older.&quot; That&#x27;s a pretty tiny slice of that graph. Maybe it just hasn&#x27;t been thoroughly interrogated but my gut says that whoever attached that SSI criticism would have probably addressed more severe discrepancies first.<p>The source-- a libertarian blog-- implies that the problem is welfare itself, but I think the bigger problem is a naive approach to means testing that is entirely divorced from economic reality.\n\n        The primary source is a welfare bureaucrat, Gary Alexander, Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Public Welfare, not a libertarian blog: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ruzo8bm96Io?t=2191\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ruzo8bm96Io?t=2191</a>\n\n          This fact alone doesn&#x27;t mean much. He was appointed by a Republican governor and could very easily be a liberterian ideologue to the same degree of said blog.\n\n            So you actual critique over the chart provided and the claims made therein, rather than your ad hominem?<p>I don&#x27;t care who it was. Are the claims verifiable, and are the derived claims defensible?\n\n              No, that&#x27;s not my critique at all. If you go back and read the comment I was replying to and then my reply, you&#x27;ll understand why I said what I said.\n\n          A conservative &quot;welfare bureaucrat&quot; who was brought in to gut the welfare system\n\n          Thanks for the correction. I know nothing of that person.\n\n          You mean former Secretary of Public Welfare, who resigned after two years on the job in 2013. He now runs an anti-welfare consulting business. He was highly controversial during the two years he was in the job, and the Obama administration had to step in. He also claimed he was moving to Pennsylvania, and then used public funds to commute to his Rhode Island home instead.\n\n      How much of that standard of living is based on credit, though?  Credit is largely based on income.  Housing, payment flexibility for amenities and vacations, big ticket purchases that reduce long-term costs, etc.<p>When 3&#x2F;4 of those making less than 50k and 2&#x2F;3 of those making less than 100k are living paycheck to paycheck, that extra flexibility influences quality of life quite a bit.<p>Quote (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankrate.com&#x2F;finance&#x2F;credit-cards&#x2F;living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankrate.com&#x2F;finance&#x2F;credit-cards&#x2F;living-paychec...</a>):<p><pre><code>   * Statistics vary, but between 55 percent to 63 percent of Americans are likely living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\n   * Three in four Americans who earn less than $50,000 are living paycheck to paycheck, compared to roughly two in three of those making $50,000 to $100,000.</code></pre>\n\n        I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of it. It could help explain how one person has to live in a roach infested apartment while another can get a nice house in the suburbs. Same with having no car or only being able to afford a used one in poor condition vs having nice new cars with very low monthly payments. Those two things alone can mean a lot in terms of standard of living.<p>I know that they say it&#x27;s expensive to be poor but it&#x27;d be a very broken system if we had a $60k a year social safety net for everyone, but poor people still couldn&#x27;t afford fresh healthy food, reliable transportation, or adequate housing and were still fighting to keep their heads just above water.\n\n    That graph needs [citation]s. The source it cites does not mention how they obtained the figures for childcare, and a questioner in the comments asks for, and does not receive, a source for that information. The source article itself doesn&#x27;t even seem to be the source, it links to yet <i>another</i> article. That article <i>also</i> doesn&#x27;t seem to be the source, the source appears to be … a politician.<p>The childcare part — the largest and most problematic benefits cliff in the graph — appears to be specific to PA. But PA doesn&#x27;t offer a monetary childcare benefit: one would have to be arguing that <i>this is the specific dollar amount that the care is worth</i> … which … IDK. I&#x27;d like to at least <i>see</i> that argument. But the vesting cliff, as depicted, doesn&#x27;t line up with any of PA&#x27;s cutoffs, <i>either.</i><p>So, this graph smells of statistical lies.\n\n      The original chart (2012) is from Gary Alexander, Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Public Welfare.[1] Pennsylvania has a substantial program to pay for child care for many of its residents: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.pa.gov&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Children&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;Child-Care-Works-Program.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.pa.gov&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Children&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;Child-Care-Wo...</a><p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ruzo8bm96Io?t=2191\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ruzo8bm96Io?t=2191</a>\n\n      Here&#x27;s an older CBO report making the same point (p.15): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;cbofiles&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;cbofiles&#x2F;attachments...</a>\n\n    I… can’t figure out what you’re saying.<p>1) “making $30k on welfare”. What is the dollar amount here? Literal checks? All support including food stamps?<p>2) someone making $81k will take home something like $50k of their income. That’s _way_ more than $30k\n\n    That&#x27;s an incredibly concise description of it, thank you.\n\n  &gt; <i>I have never understood why things like this don&#x27;t use some sort of sliding scale, rather than absolute dividing line.</i><p>Because it&#x27;s easier to pass a law that sets up such welfare when it has a simple threshold, or at least it was.<p>Last time this article came up, someone referenced a group of lawmakers in the US who were working at smoothing out these awful discontinuities, but I can&#x27;t quickly rustle up the link.\n\n    And there are tons of these various programs, all with differing requirements, and some take into account others and some don&#x27;t.<p>Some trigger &quot;automatically&quot; (if you apply for X and receive it, you qualify for Y, Z) and that can have weird side effects, too.\n\n    The cliff might be a political feature: you save paying out the benefit (that you took credit for funding) since people who blow the cliff lose the money, but if they complain can be characterized as (some variation of) &quot;welfare cheats&quot;.\n\n  Frankly, because many people think that any kind of welfare or assistance is, at best, a necessary evil—and more often just <i>evil</i>—and they <i>want</i> to make it painful, complicated, and hard to access.\n\n    There were parts of what I described that were brutally difficult. Particularly, we would receive a certain $ amount to purchase books (that were frequently $500+ dollars per semester). However, the office that doled this fund out would frequently be <i>weeks</i> behind, or your scheduled disbursement just wouldn’t show up. Then you’d have to find multiple hours out of your work week to go down to the financial aid office to wait in line for hours in an office that was only open 10am-2pm. Or sometimes the complete scam of a bank&#x2F;card they forced you to use had some issue.<p>So, frequently, you wouldnt even be able to purchase books without a loan or extending credit til 1-2 months into the semester. by that time you could be having midterms and tons of assignment with no textbooks. I would frequently have to beg other students to let me photocopy sections of their books so I could do the assignments. Or resort to pirating.<p>To them that’s “working as intended” I guess. no amount of complaining ever got anywhere.\n\n  &gt; I have never understood why things like this don’t use some sort of sliding scale, rather than absolute dividing line.<p>They often do use sliding scales, but that’s more complex (and expensive) to administer, and (because of multiple interacting programs) ends up not actually solving much of anything. Also, because of the way things (including available funds) work, but even ignoring budgeting for the increased admin cost, a sliding scale probably would start stepping down from full benefit where a sharp cutoff is, that would probably be more like the middle of the sliding scale, so if you “barely squeaked in under the limit” on the sharp cutoff version, you’d probably get <i>far less</i> benefit under a sliding scale system.\n\n  I changed career paths post age 40 via a coding bootcamp.<p>Despite being a terrible student when I was younger, I found had a great time learning, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my job ever since.<p>I found myself in a strange position though, lots of services offered benefits to students, discounts, internships, storage &#x2F; compute time etc.   I was not enrolled in a traditional university (although they were administering it), and so I didn&#x27;t qualify, for much of any of those kinds of offers.  Most of the systems in place thought of students as a typical 4 year university student and frankly ... younger.   One internship I applied to did not seem to clearly indicate they were only really interested in younger, and more traditional students until the second interview.<p>Some of these rules I get, they don&#x27;t want someone abusing their free &#x2F; discounts for other reasons and they have systems in place for dealing with traditional students.<p>With people changing jobs and seemingly continued potential for the need for job market retraining and related disruption and etc ... it feels like it&#x27;s time to make some adjustments as far as what a &quot;student&quot; is and so on.\n\n    &gt;One internship I applied to did not seem to clearly indicate they were only really interested in younger, and more traditional students until the second interview.<p>Well, you missed out on a lucrative lawsuit there if you&#x27;re in the US. An interviewer telling someone they&#x27;re not going to be hired because they&#x27;re over 40 (or even just because they&#x27;re not young enough, when they are over 40) is legally equivalent to telling them they&#x27;re not going to be hired because they&#x27;re black or Jewish.\n\n      When you&#x27;re changing your career and trying to get into an industry ... it&#x27;s hard to know how that plays out.   More directly a buddy of mine, also my age, and in the same camp was straight up told by a recruiter they were looking for someone younger.   He had her on speakerphone and asked her to repeat it and she did.<p>Then the question was, do you want to be the guy who calls that out?  Trying to get a job...<p>I don&#x27;t think the outcome is a sure thing, in that case I wanted to do &#x2F; say something but I felt like it was the applicant&#x27;s call.  Not an easy decision.<p>I respected his choice to just move on, still burns me up a little, but his call IMO.\n\n    I finished my bachelors degree after I turned 40. I was a much better student than I’d been in my 20s or teens.<p>My wife is friendly pursuing her bachelor’s and it is clear to both of us that universities are really just tolerant of non-traditional students. You won’t be treated poorly, but all of the infrastructure, tools, class progression, etc, is constructed around post-Highschool young adults.<p>It’s been a while since I’ve been to a community college, but I suspect they’re slightly better.\n\n      I agree, there&#x27;s a weird culture barrier almost at times.<p>My wife was in grad school and pregnant.   Some of the instructors seemed completely confused on how to handle things.   Others seemed to handle it in stride.<p>It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s an expectation that &quot;you&#x27;re relatively poor, young&quot; and some other expectations that when that&#x27;s not the case the system starts to fall apart.\n\n        Yep, my wife did a masters degree in a program &quot;for professionals&quot;, which was very clearly designed around people between the ages of 22 and 25, with empty evenings and weekends and definitely no children :)\n\n  It&#x27;s because the people who make such rules are both innumerate and if not lazy then uncaring.\n\n  Not to condone the school&#x27;s policy, but could you have donated the excess income to charity to get your taxable income back under the limit?\n\n    Probably not relevant unless you have itemized deductions&#x2F;donations above the value of the standard deduction.\n\n  &gt;I have never understood why things like this don&#x27;t use some sort of sliding scale, rather than absolute dividing line.<p>Try translating your idea of a sliding scale into a piece of legislation which matches your intention.\n\n    Here’s my shot: Anyone may at any time declare a portion of their income to be “cliff income,” pay 40% percent tax on it to the feds and 20% to the state, and then keep the last 40% to do with as you please. All govt and private programs that measure income  are required to disregard cliff income.\n\n    The usual solution is something like: for x units of excess past the set limit, remove y unit of subsidy&#x2F;support.<p>Example: something costs 20 money, if you earn 100 money or below, then it is subsidized to cost only 10, where 10 money is a subsidy.\nFor every 2 money you gain, 1 money in subsidy is removed.<p>If you earn 104 money, it will now cost 12.<p>The x and y values vary depending on what kind of things are subsidized, but this is a fairly simple way of doing it that doesn&#x27;t punish you harshly for a small difference in earnings.\n\n(2020), but still interesting.\n\n&gt; It&#x27;s generally believed that this is caused by a discontinuity in youth sports:<p>&gt; 2. Within a given year, older kids are stronger, faster, etc., and perform better<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few youth ice hockey games and by god it&#x27;s just unfair; there&#x27;s a kid like a foot taller than the rest. I&#x27;m kind of surprised there isn&#x27;t some system that buckets kids by size , it can&#x27;t be fun for the small kids to get elbowed in the neck every time they bump the tall guy.\n\n  I remember playing basketball as a kid and being very entertained beating kids that were much taller than I was. Sure, they had the height, but they lacked so many fundamental skills and sometimes it was clear they didn&#x27;t think they had to work very hard or do practice drills because they were tall.<p>Fun fact, the ball and hoop don&#x27;t care about any of that. It lets me steal it from you and it lets me put it into the hoop. The scorekeepers even add two to the scoreboard!\n\n    &gt; Fun fact, the ball and hoop don&#x27;t care about any of that.<p>Tangent: I grew up around a high school basketball coach and saw that <i>all</i> of the adults knew exactly who was going to college in which sport, and usually by late jr. high.  We&#x27;d go to games just because he said some kid on the visiting team was going pro and that&#x27;s exactly what happened.\n\n      Can  you expound more? How did this work across different fields of sport? I assume a basketball scout can recognize talent early in their domain but how is it crossing sports?\n\n        We&#x27;re talking about people dedicated to the idea of &quot;sport&quot; in general getting excited about kids in local communities who are already talented and driven enough to be twice as good as their peers.  Sports scouts follow up on phone calls more than they discover talent hidden away in the cornfield, if you see what I mean.\n\n  If you&#x27;ve ever played Nintendo&#x27;s Ice Hockey (1988), it&#x27;s super realistic, and the tradeoffs of big vs little are clear: little guys bounce off of big guys and big guys move slow.<p>My kid is in 12U youth hockey and is a big guy, and yeah, smaller kids can often usually skate around him, but if they bump into him, they fall over, and often he&#x27;ll get a &quot;big kid penalty&quot; which means he gets a break in the penalty box for the crime of being tall and physically near a smaller player who fell over. We had to do a bit of coaching on how to make (allowed) physical contact so it reasonable contact doesn&#x27;t look like prohibited contact (mostly be sure to have hands off when kids are falling, it&#x27;s real easy to look like cross checking when it was actually just incidental contact).<p>Some of the littler kids seem to have a lot of fun getting away with a lot more physical play than he can. Although he says he enjoys it when a small kid gets mad at him and tries to knock him over, too. So at least so far, seems like everyone is having fun.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can really just bucket kids by size and ignore age though... there&#x27;s a lot of mental development between 10U hockey and 12U hockey, and putting a big 10 year old on the 12U team is often not right because the level of play is so much different, most 10 year olds won&#x27;t keep up. At the same time, a small 12 year old on the 10U team is going to have a big advantage from age.<p>Around here we do have two different leagues, one for &#x27;recreational&#x27; teams and one for &#x27;reputation&#x27; teams, and you more or less have to demonstrate a decent amount of skill to get on the rep team, and then you&#x27;re playing with much better teams. All the teams are composed of a mix of big and small kids though.<p>Edit to add: All that said, I think bucketing kids by age makes sense <i>and</i> I agree that there can be advantage to being at the extremes of the cohort. Since the US school system usually has a different cutoff date (september-ish) than US youth hockey (jan 1), you might see different results where there&#x27;s grade level based high school hockey and age based youth hockey... but not in Canada where the cutoff is Jan 1 for both.\n\n    I think you could bucket by age but have the ability to move kids around.<p>The problem is that these youth sports can get very competitive, and then people will be tempted to move the bigger kids down to get an advantage.\n\n      At least in USA Hockey, it&#x27;s not too hard to get approval for kids to &#x27;play up&#x27;, our 12U team this year had 3 kids that were under age by one year. Getting approval to &#x27;play down&#x27; is a lot harder. Our competitive league rules say (sorry for caps) &quot;HAVING 10U PLAYERS PLAYING UP AT 12U IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS TO DO SO. EACH ASSOCIATION AT THEIR DISCRETION MAY ALLOW UP TO TWO 10U PLAYERS PER SEASON TO PLAY UP AT THE 12U DIVISION.&quot; And further players are on a case by case basis, determined by a league coordinator from the opposite side of the state.<p>USA Hockey rules don&#x27;t permit playing down unless a doctor says it&#x27;s medically necessary, but then they&#x27;re not allowed to play on competitive teams. Simply being small or unskilled is specifically not an acceptable reason. [1]<p>IMHO: playing up is pretty easy to administer, but playing down would be very hard to administer fairly for competitive teams, so it&#x27;s just flat out prohibited.<p>Edit for further thought: If you have enough participants, it might make sense to try running Jan 1 leagues and Jul 1 leagues and see if it makes sense to go to quarterly leagues too. Or maybe agitate to change the cutoff for Spring Hockey and see how that looks?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sedistrict.org&#x2F;page&#x2F;show&#x2F;834907-playing-up-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sedistrict.org&#x2F;page&#x2F;show&#x2F;834907-playing-up-down</a>\n\n    <i>&gt; I don&#x27;t think you can really just bucket kids by size and ignore age though... there&#x27;s a lot of mental development between 10U hockey and 12U hockey, and putting a big 10 year old on the 12U team is often not right because the level of play is so much different, most 10 year olds won&#x27;t keep up.</i><p>A friend of mine has a son who is giant for his age. The kid is 7 but he&#x27;s the size of a late middle-schooler.<p>One of the things that ends up being really difficult for him is that everyone around him assumes that he should be smarter and more mature than he is. They inadvertently expect him to be mentally the same age as kids the same size as him. It sucks because it makes him seem developmentally disabled or emotionally unregulated. He&#x27;s not! He&#x27;s a totally normal seven-year-old. Just a really tall one.\n\n      Yeah, we definitely get&#x2F;got a lot of that. At his current size&#x2F;age, it&#x27;s not so bad, but it was definitely a bigger deal when he was a newborn that looked like 2 months old (delivery nurses didn&#x27;t understand why we were in their ward), and a preschooler who looks older, where there&#x27;s a lot of development happening in a short amount of time.\n\n  I noticed the same in Ontario, any kids who weren’t born in the first few months of the year had a huge disadvantage.\n\nRelated:<p><i>Suspicious Discontinuities</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28452926\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28452926</a> - Sept 2021 (54 comments)<p><i>Suspicious Discontinuities</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22378555\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22378555</a> - Feb 2020 (297 comments)\n\nAlso UK VAT.

I see now. Because people stop playing when they hit a milestone, right.\n\n  Haha, guilty. I put my rapid rating above 2k and haven&#x27;t played in months since then.\n\n    When I dip below 600, I usually get angry and play more, then lose and quit even further down.\n\n  (That’s basically how the election falsification example in TFA works, too: a lot of individuals targeting a subjectively nice metric without cooperating with one another.)\n\n  Or you can look at the cut off date of competitive sports players and athletes. If January 1st is the cut off for age there will be a disproportionate number of players born in December. If it&#x27;s June 1st many of the players will have birthdates in May and April.\n\nAnother place this shows up is in online chess ratings.<p>See Lichess:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lichess.org&#x2F;stat&#x2F;rating&#x2F;distribution&#x2F;blitz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lichess.org&#x2F;stat&#x2F;rating&#x2F;distribution&#x2F;blitz</a><p>Couldn&#x27;t find this in Chess.com stats, but maybe they do some smoothing in their plot.\n\n&gt;One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there&#x27;s a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). ... That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they&#x27;d be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.<p>I had the opposite problem for the 2022 tax year: I turned out that, with investment losses and no earned income, my adjusted income was below the poverty line, which ... means your ACA healthcare subsidy is cut off entirely!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;affordable-care-act&#x2F;individuals-and-families&#x2F;eligibility-for-the-premium-tax-credit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;affordable-care-act&#x2F;individuals-and-fami...</a><p>The &quot;logic&quot; there (from reading discussions of the cutoff) is that, &quot;well, if you&#x27;re below the poverty line, you should be on Medicaid and not on the ACA exchanges at all, silly!&quot; Okay, but if you have wildly varying income, and a high income from previous years, you don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ll be &quot;in poverty&quot; this year, and won&#x27;t qualify because of the past year.<p>I was tempted to update my taxes to claim phantom income from my imaginary cash-based business, which would then get me the subsidy, but that feels ick.<p>(Which, I know, being retired on crypto, I <i>also</i> feel ick about taking the subsidies to begin with, but that&#x27;s a different issue.)\n\n  A reminder to anyone reading that there is no actual &quot;opposite problem&quot; to yours (which I&#x27;m very disturbed to hear about, hope things work out).<p>For now, there is no income level cut off for ACA premium subsidies, just a limit that says you should never spend more than 8.3% of your AGI (more or less) on health insurance (more or less).<p>This may change next year and&#x2F;or in the future.\n\n  &gt; The &quot;logic&quot; there (from reading discussions of the cutoff) is that, &quot;well, if you&#x27;re below the poverty line, you should be on Medicaid and not on the ACA exchanges at all, silly!&quot; Okay, but if you have wildly varying income, and a high income from previous years, you don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ll be &quot;in poverty&quot; this year, and won&#x27;t qualify because of the past year.<p>This wasn&#x27;t setup this way because it was thought to be a good design, but as a political compromise. At the time, it was seen as important to keep the headline cost of the bill below some arbitrary threshold and for it to be revenue neutral (the wisdom of this is questionable in hindsight since the moderate Dems that supported the bill mostly got wiped out anyway and it never got any Republican support). Medicaid is cheaper for the government than ACA subsidies (at least for low income people given the way the subsidies are structured), partly because the government has a lot of negotiating power and partly because Medicaid is stingy.<p>This was made worse when the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government couldn&#x27;t make receiving existing Medicaid funding conditional on Medicaid expansion (Medicaid is partially funded by the federal government, but the program is administered by individual states) so whether the Medicaid expansion is even available to you largely depends on whether your state is run by Democrats or Republicans (with a few notable exceptions).\n\n    People like me are an extreme edge case, I doubt this was a big factor in any debate.\n\n  I would consider just taking the medicaid for a year.<p>Medicaid can actually be very good quality healthcare, if you&#x27;re located say, near a very good research hospital in a city with a structural oversupply of medical care due to having a lot of med schools.<p>I&#x27;d rather have medicaid living next to a high quality (non profit) health system,  than &quot;nice&quot; insurance living in a shithole. All the insurance in the world can&#x27;t materialize doctors that aren&#x27;t there\n\n    &gt; I would consider just taking the Medicaid for a year.<p>ACA subsidy eligibility may be annual, but Medicaid eligibility is based on current <i>monthly</i> income, and if you have a change that makes you ineligible, you lose it. You can’t just decide to “take Medicaid for a year” because you aren’t subsidy-eligible based on prior-year income.\n\n      So? Isn&#x27;t losing medicaid an ACA qualifying event? Your income goes up, you lose the medicaid but now qualify for ACA.<p>That said, in my secondhand experience across multiple states I won&#x27;t name, the medicaid office probably won&#x27;t actually find out or do anything before 12 months are up.<p>Also, a few states are starting to officially enact &quot;continuous eligibility&quot; and intentionally not check your income for 12 months -- mostly for children[1] right now, but some states for adults[2] too.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicaid.gov&#x2F;medicaid&#x2F;enrollment-strategies&#x2F;continuous-eligibility-medicaid-and-chip-coverage&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicaid.gov&#x2F;medicaid&#x2F;enrollment-strategies&#x2F;cont...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2023&#x2F;sep&#x2F;ensuring-continuous-eligibility-medicaid-impacts-adults\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2...</a>\n\n      ACA subsidy eligibility is not annual. &quot;Income changed&quot; is a qualifying event.\n\n  &gt; (Which, I know, being retired on crypto, I also feel ick about taking the subsidies to begin with, but that&#x27;s a different issue.)<p>One qualifies for subsidies regardless of how much wealth they have? Sounds like US welfare system is a joke.\n\n    Well, remember, any time you have cutoffs like that, you can introduce the kind of welfare traps and discontinuities that the article focuses on. But yes, Congress definitely wasn&#x27;t even asking &quot;wait, do we want the subsides for high NW, choose-your-income people?&quot;\n\n  I had a friend in that situation one year. He reported some imaginary income that brought him up over that limit. Paid the tax on it, received the subsidy, and was able to continue with his existing ACA healthcare plan (and doctors, and etc).\n\n    Oh wow, good to know about other people who went that route. I was also considering getting a friend to pay me &quot;consulting fees&quot; for their business, and then I&#x27;d silently gift back the money ... but, as above, ick.\n\nAt least in the government, there should be a law that any hypothetical scenario where someone making more money before government taxes&#x2F;incentives would cause them to earn less after, must be quickly resolved by replacing hard cutoffs with gradients.<p>No benefits should apply 100% for anyone making under a certain amount and 0% for anyone making over. Instead there should be a range they slowly decrease, so that if you make $1 more before the benefit you still get less than $1 after. Maybe even a lot less, like only $.30. But you should never <i>lose</i> money.<p>This is obvious. It goes to show how bad beaurocracy and subtle misaligned incentives are that these hard cutoffs ever existed in the first place.\n\n  This is why people don&#x27;t want to pay taxes at all\n\n  It all comes back to the fact that government is a low accountability sector, despite what many people seem to think.\n\n    What is the point of saying something like this? Would you prefer that people just not bother to do anything and let poor people starve to death instead?\n\n      The &quot;starve the beast&quot; propaganda has been wildly successful and is seeded deep in American culture and psyche.\n\n        &quot;Vote for me and I&#x27;ll show you how bad I can make government&quot; has been supremely effective, somehow\n\n          Republicans want to cut funding to programs, then point at how bad the underfunded program is doing, thus demanding more cuts. Either the result is the department is killed, or is on a shoestring budget and everyone hates them. Many were welcomed departments doing good works. People eventually tire of chronically underfunded gov depts, and vote the other side.<p>Democrats want more taxes, which inevitable come from middle class, not being able to get it from the poor or rich. Then they set laws in those programs as &quot;means testing&quot;, where the poor get the benefits, and the middle class doesn&#x27;t. The rich never needed it. The middle class tire of paying for everything and getting nothing, and vote the other side.<p>And, that pendulum swings back and forth.<p>And that&#x27;s how we get this horrible ass-backward system we have. And going back to first principles and doing is right is &quot;against the other side!&quot;.\n\n      It&#x27;s important to deal with reality as it is.  Perhaps government is not always the best way to prevent poor people from starving to death.\n\n        If we anticipate the private or nonprofit providers might perform poverty alleviation more optimally, we<p>(1) massively duplicate fixed costs for logistics<p>(2) ignore that a primary reason governments exist at all is to help prevent people from starving to death, despite it often being hijacked by powermongers<p>Just gotta say, that&#x27;s a pretty extreme position to take.\n\n        The private charities that fill the gaps left open by government are another form of government, just not democratically elected.<p>(I realized I was contributing to that problem by donating to local charities.)\n\n      That won&#x27;t change until there is wide enough demand to change it. Broad recognition will come long before the changes.\n\n  Replace one number (the cutoff) with two (the start and end of sliding part).\n\n  Right, and this is one of the reasons why I support a UBI that replaces most existing welfare programs. Amazingly some people criticize UBI on the grounds that it removes the incentive to work, when it&#x27;s almost exactly the opposite.\n\n    Funnily, I&#x27;m okay with people not working if they didn&#x27;t want to. Most people would end up getting bored doing nothing after a few months and work with what they like to do anyway.\n\n      But, &quot;what they like to do&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily anything that will make billionaires more money.\n\n      Devil&#x27;s advocate: the longer you stay away from gainful employment, the more marketable skills you lose. (This is one of the arguments against a minimum wage; that it keeps low-skill and therefore low-pay labor from establishing a foothold in the labor marketplace that would enable them to up-skill over time.) So UBI would incentivize the creation of a permanently unemployable underclass.<p>I&#x27;m OK with people not working if they don&#x27;t want to, too, as long as those people are OK with subsistence-level living standards. I don&#x27;t see why able-bodied people who are capable of working but just don&#x27;t want to should live a comfortable life at the expense of the working taxpayer.\n\n        &gt; as long as those people are OK with subsistence-level living standards.<p>I mean, UBI never meant &quot;Extravagant money.&quot; It has always meant something akin to &quot;basic standards for survival.&quot;<p>The entire idea from what I understand is that you should be able to survive just fine, not have it pay for your 98&quot; micro OLED :P<p>&gt; the longer you stay away from gainful employment, the more marketable skills you lose.<p>I sorta relate to this as someone who&#x27;s been coasting by at my current job for last year or so. But I&#x27;m also working to upskill myself actively. You bring a good point but I don&#x27;t know what teh solution to that would be.\n\n        Point taken, Mr. Devil. I even agree, up to a point - and I think this might be a major issue in the immediate introduction of a UBI. The reason why is that the incentives will change but there will be many who have learned the system under different conditions and will not so easily adjust.<p>I&#x27;ve grown up amongst poverty and while I don&#x27;t particularly like the term (as it tends to be deployed in aid of demagoguery), there really is a element of &#x27;welfare culture&#x27; in effect, and having been on welfare myself (and treated like a prince because bizarrely the system was obviously classist: so Ed you&#x27;re an out of work indie game dev and you&#x27;re currently learning something called &#x27;Nim&#x27;? &quot;well that&#x27;s just great then have some money&quot;. Go in there as a bricklayer and say you are looking but haven&#x27;t found any work the past few weeks: here are 20 forms). I was always very impressed on the knowledge these working class labourers would have of the welfare system, because in their situation it really made a difference.<p>Their attidue was: (and who can blame them) fuck the govt they don&#x27;t give a shit about me, the more I get &#x2F; the more I can play the system, the better.<p>UBI from their perspective would be total victory. No more queuing no more forms or interviews, just free money for ever. But what then?<p>If the UBI was only sufficient for survival &#x2F; dignity but not enough for luxury I think the psychological topology chances <i>a lot</i> and what could be previously described as &#x27;getting one over on this enemy&#x27; now can only be described as your own failure.\n\n        The devil doesn&#x27;t need volunteer advocates, he can afford plenty paid. But you actually make the case <i>for</i> UBI as a replacement for means-tested welfare and its associated cliffs: “the longer you stay away from gainful employment, the more marketable skills you lose.”<p>That&#x27;s one of the main points of UBI as a replacement for means-tested welfare [0]: eliminating the perverse incentives against maximizing outside work and for expending energy into working the system that exists with means-tested welfare that has complex eligibility rules and is rapidly cut with outside income. By making the clawback <i>much</i> slower and starting much higher up the income scale through the tax system, UBI, compared to the status quo, rewards gaining additional income in the labor (or other) market and learning skills other than navigating a welfare system.<p>There is a reason that UBI—under the name “negative income tax” because of the political valence of taxation on that corner of the political universe—was originally a right-libertarian proposal.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m OK with people not working if they don&#x27;t want to, too, as long as those people are OK with subsistence-level living standards<p>There&#x27;s no plausible way a UBI provides anything substantially better than that any time in the near (likely, the lifespan of abyone now living) future, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>[0] Perhaps even stronger if UBI is also seen as a (partial or full) replacement for the minimum wage, which could be justified because, unlike means-trsted welfare, it doesn&#x27;t tail off with income and provides a basic support level for all—there is then no reason that employment must <i>also</i> serve that minimal support purpose, which makes it possible to offer employment whose marginal value to the employer is less than would minimally support an employee, but which would still be positive (and in some cases still have more long-term value to the employee because of experience that could contribute to more valuable future employment.)\n\n      I&#x27;m early-retired and all I can say is that it didn&#x27;t work that way for me. I do have more time, but I&#x27;m not so bored that I want to tie up my schedule. I&#x27;ll come up with a project I can do at my own pace.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like telling yourself that you&#x27;ll go back to school. Some people do, but most don&#x27;t.\n\n        &gt; I&#x27;ll come up with a project I can do at my own pace.<p>Right, but wouldn&#x27;t that be similar? Obviously there are going to be people who are going to say &quot;screw it, I&#x27;m going to live like this&quot; on a basic survival-wage UBI, but I doubt a majority would want to.\n\n          I wouldn&#x27;t expect a small but steady income to be enough all by itself, but it will put people closer to retiring. When combined with some savings, I&#x27;d expect some people would choose to retire earlier than they would if they didn&#x27;t have it.<p>I do support UBI, but I also expect that it would have complicated effects.\n\n    Is UBI the same as a negative income tax that Milton Friedman advocated for?\n\n      The most common variant is for (effectively) every adult citizen to receive a fixed &quot;tax refund&quot; amount.<p>This is paid for by a combination of: replacing existing welfare with UBI, retrenching the bureaucrats that used to implement those complex welfare programs, and increasing the percentage of income tax paid.<p>There&#x27;s some threshold where you might pay extra $20K on your income, but you get a flat $20K back as UBI, so you don&#x27;t notice any change. This is typically somewhere in the middle class. Everyone poorer than this gets a boost to their income and&#x2F;or have their existing welfare (and associated requirements!) replaced by an <i>unconditional</i> payment.<p>Everyone richer pays more tax, but not a huge amount more, since UBI mostly replaces existing welfare. It isn&#x27;t an entirely new type of welfare on top of existing welfare -- this is the <i>strawman</i> that the right-wing likes to use in debates.\n\n      Negative income tax is the Earned Income Tax Credit, paying a subsidy for earning income.\n\n  These kinds of anti patterns are quite intentional and meant to drum up resentment for government programs for all sides of the argument.\n\n  &gt; At least in the government, there should be a law that any hypothetical scenario where someone making more money before government taxes&#x2F;incentives would cause them to earn less after, must be quickly resolved by replacing hard cutoffs with gradients.<p>Multiple programs, offered by different jurisdictions, with overlapping populations, each with sliding scale benefits that reduce less than $1 of benefit for each $ of income, still can (and do) end up with beneficiaries losing in net with additional income. But instead of doing so at particular cliff points associated with each program, they do so continually over a wide range. You replace a series of cliffs with a slide.\n\nI&#x27;d bet the race time data looks similar to weight-lifting data for certain thresholds, whether it&#x27;s the number or plates or such. Goals people set and then they mentally stop themselves at that goal.\n\nWe had something like this when we were on ACA one year. I hadn&#x27;t been working that year, but I ended up getting a job in August and it looked like we were going to go over the income threshold because we have a rental and were getting rental income. I asked the renters to please not pay their rent for Sept-December until January of the next year. They happily complied. We were able to squeak under the threshold, but it was close.\n\n  I guess you were taxed on cash accounting not accrual?\n\n    Didn&#x27;t receive the income for 4 months of rent until January of the next year. Reported the income in the year it was received. Isn&#x27;t that generally how it works? (not an accountant or a tax expert)\n\n    Individual income taxes in the US are usually cash basis (it is poasible to change to accrual, but from what I understand it almost never makes sense for an individual to do so.)<p>And only individual income taxes would be directly relevant to individual ACA subsidy eligibility.\n\nNeed to add this one here \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;martinmbauer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1769672126905090386\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;martinmbauer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1769672126905090386</a>\n\nThe worst one of these that affected me was money helping people in the 2008 housing crisis. qualifying was based on what percentage of your income your mortgage payment was.  So I would have got it if I had made a little less money, or if i had bought a house I knew I couldn’t afford. It felt like being punished for making the right decisions.\n\n  So... people who&#x27;d been misled into making bad decisions and were being given help because they really needed it, made you feel like you were being punished by not getting similar help you didn&#x27;t really need because you were making OK money and had avoided making the same kind of mistake?<p>IMO, that&#x27;s a <i>really</i> glass-half-empty way of looking at the situation.<p>You did good! Try to give yourself a break. People like you who didn&#x27;t fall for the sleazy mortgage brokers helped limit the damage that the rest of society had to deal with. And maybe next time some society-wide con goes down, if you (or someone you love) is unlucky enough to get stung by it (because none of us are smart enough to spot the con-men 100% of the time), hopefully you (or they) will get the help that&#x27;s available that time around when it is really needed.\n\n    It&#x27;s definitely both a glass-half-empty way of looking at things, and also true. I think the point is that the people who did the right thing ended up, at the end, with smaller houses and the same money.\n\n    I forgot to mention that because of the crash I was underwater on the house and couldn’t afford to sell it even though I wanted to.<p>It was also something silly like the article, where if I made like $5k less annually I would have qualified for much more than that.  I was struggling at the time and really could have used it.\n\n  This is like saying, &quot;If only <i>my</i> house had been destroyed by a hurricane too, and then I would have qualified for that sweet FEMA money.&quot;<p>I mean, sure, but you were still better off to not have your house destroyed in the first place.\n\n    No, his house was just as &quot;destroyed&quot; as everyone else&#x27;s. It&#x27;s like complaining that after his house was destroyed by the same hurricane that hit the rest of the neighborhood, FEMA made him, but only him, ineligible for assistance.\n\nThe discontinuities at the used care sale prices graph seems like an arbitrage opportunity on depreciation. Buy right after a round number, sell right before another, pay less on dep.\n\nI was all excited when I saw on Zillow a decent new apartment complex in town with rents that were actually reasonable...  until, after hours of studying photos and floorplans and neighborhood, I noticed a statement on Zillow, near the bottom of the scroll, in one of the tabs in right column, that the building is subsidized, and there&#x27;s a permissible income range.<p>While some of us could qualify while on early startup salaries, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d feel about subsidies as a techbro, and I know I wouldn&#x27;t feel good about having to move from a nice building (big time investment, moving monetary cost, and quite possibly moving to a crappier building) because the startup was doing OK.<p>I was disappointed, but not surprised.  As a middle-class techbro, this is a very lite version of a much bigger problem that has affected many low-income people.  News has long had stories about low-income people who are trapped with subsidies they need (housing, food, support for children, etc.).  They make a lousy wage, and can&#x27;t afford to get much of a better wage, because the societal safety net on which they depend would be ripped out from under them before they could afford it to.\n\n  &gt;I know I wouldn&#x27;t feel good about having to move from a nice building because the startup was doing OK.<p>Subsidized apartment buildings in the US don&#x27;t make you move out if your income goes up: they just take away your subsidy, i.e., your rent goes up to what HUD calls the apartment&#x27;s &quot;contract rent&quot;. Then HUD (statistically speaking) directs the money they used to use to subsidize your rent to building more subsidized housing. HUD <i>wants</i> successful people living in HUD-subsidized buildings, at least the ones with children in them, to serve as role models.\n\n    Interesting; that sounds enlightened of HUD.\n\nIt&#x27;s too bad income &quot;cut-offs&quot; even exist. Shouldn&#x27;t it always be a smooth function?\n\n  Smooth - definitely not.  Continuous - yes.  (SCNR.)\n\n  It depends on public opinion. In some countries people think, taxes must be equal for all, or linearly grow (and with ideally smooth function).<p>They even sometimes change mind and make experiment with other function.<p>Many experts think, this is because in these countries, laws made entities tax agents (every entity pay all taxes for all hired people), so people just don&#x27;t bother how many taxes they pay, and how much time spent to calculate all these things and to fill all papers.\n\nThe author of the marathon paper explains the phenomenon he is observing, and then goes on to &quot;reject that explanation&quot; without attempting to do anything to control for it.<p>&gt;For example, the 2013 Chicago Marathon provided pace teams for 3:00, 3:05, 3:10, 3:15, 3:20, 3:25, 3:30, 3:35, 3:40, 3:45, 3:50, 3:55, 4:00, 4:10, 4:25, 4:30, 4:40, 4:55, 5:00, 5:10, 5:25, and 5:45.T he institution of pace teams then could provide an alternative explanation for the bunching we observe at round numbers.<p>It would be easy to do, even. Restrict to marathons where the pace team spectrum is known to be of a specific type and see if the other spikes disappear. The author certainly has the data to do this, and isn&#x27;t. <i>That</i> is suspicious.\n\n  There is one more reason for discontinuity around 4:00 - many amateur runners make a goal to run in 4:00 or less (hard but achievable) and reduce training intensity once they finished in 3:5x - 4:00.\n\n    That doesn&#x27;t explain a discontinuity, and moreover, the effect of the pace runners has yet to be controlled for, so there is no more explanation required.\n\n&gt; One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there&#x27;s a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn&#x27;t have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200&#x2F;yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they&#x27;d be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.<p>Except that in real life there is no &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null that you can immediately pipe in <i>exactly</i> $6440 to hit your target.<p>You have to spend your <i>time</i> in order to achieve this reduction in AGI.<p>And discontinuities being discontinuous means that the number of people who have the necessary training&#x2F;experience to confidently achieve this in, say, three hours, is probably in the same ballpark as people who can successfully set up encrypted email in the same amount of time.<p>For everyone else, it&#x27;s going to take at least a week&#x27;s worth of time to plan, double check, execute, triple check, etc. (And realistically double that, or more.)<p>At 55K, you&#x27;ve already spent that savings in the value of the time you gave up to get the savings.<p>People often make fun of free software developers for failing to properly value their own time. But at least that&#x27;s not their domain of expertise. A financial hobbyist spending $2 of their time to save $1 is professional grade irony.<p>Edit: clarification\n\n  The example of buying options given in the article would take literally minutes for anyone with an existing brokerage account.\n\n  These aren&#x27;t financial hobbyists.<p>At $48,560, these are mostly people who don&#x27;t have a lot of money relative to their living expenses, and are doing what they need to do in order to not feel totally broke. &lt; $50k in a lot of places was already getting hard to raise a family on, even before Covid, all the moreso if you&#x27;re paying full price for ACA exchange insurance, which was then and remains now disgustingly expensive.\n\naside: if you&#x27;re on Arc browser, I made a boost that adds some styling to Dan&#x27;s website to make the reading experience just a little better: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arc.net&#x2F;boost&#x2F;80CE9A49-4D0A-48C6-9C53-13BF02696009\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arc.net&#x2F;boost&#x2F;80CE9A49-4D0A-48C6-9C53-13BF02696009</a>\n\nCoding hard cut-offs like this into legislation, regulation or policies seems crazy almost to the point of negligence, incompetence or malice. Especially when it&#x27;s so obvious such cliffs will incentivize behavior certain to cause negative or perverse outcomes. It&#x27;s even more incomprehensible when implementing graduated thresholds is so well understood.<p>A related common failure mode is baking in fixed, absolute thresholds for dynamic domains sure to evolve instead of linking thresholds to dynamic metrics (such as inflation, cost of living, etc).\n\n  It&#x27;s often said that the cruelty is the point.\n\n    If it were, why would they offer welfare programs at all? Surely an &quot;indolence tax&quot; assessed on anyone with income below a certain threshold would be more cruel.\n\n      What do you think poor people would do if there were no welfare programs?\n\n        This is what I find perplexing.<p>Welfare programs are not for the poor.<p>They are so the poor doesn&#x27;t &quot;eat the rich&quot;.<p>(For those playing at home this is a slogan tossed around with connotations of society wide rebellion - which would not be a comfortable outcome for rich people.)\n\n      It&#x27;s frankly amazing that we still have welfare, social security, etc., at all. The pro-cruelty folks have been diligently working to discredit them since FDR enacted them during the great depression.\n\n      Don’t give them any ideas. Roughly half of US politicians would probably support that. Without constitutional safeguards, a shocking number of them would support turning their opponents into Soylent Green.\n\n  This unthinking encoding of thresholds feels like a &#x27;Systems&#x27; problem that percolates into almost every part of life, whether its income brackets or hard limits on how many books you can borrow from the library. Some make more sense than others, just out of the sheer complexity and cost of implementing continuous (e.g. tapering) systems in the real world.<p>A particularly troublesome example I encountered, entirely unrelated to finance, was when working on a renal ward in hospital, we had to count respiration rate and input it into the obs machine, but if you inputted over 16, it would increase their sepsis score (or &quot;acute deterioration&quot;), meaning there&#x27;d be additional work to be done. It was rarely the case that they were actually producing symptoms of sepsis, but because of the hard threshold, to my horror, nurses would often just enter 16 on the mark, and juniors like me were told to do the same.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are literally tonnes of examples of these discontinuities and the bad incentives they produce across every industry and government function. In addition to laziness and inertia, I feel a general problem is that lack of curve&#x2F;distribution&#x2F;continuous-thinking in our schooling, as opposed to the easier discrete thinking.<p>All systems are fundamentally analog in nature. If only we just taught things this way...\n\n  How can it be blamed to negligence? It&#x27;s not like these disincentives and dangerous gotchas are not obvious when these rules are written?\n\nIf you are upset about somebody not wanting to take that $50k a year job because it would cost them a subsidy, just wait until you hear about trust funds and inheritance!!<p>If you think losing a $20k subsidy is demotivating, imagine inheriting $25 million.<p>So instead of knuckling down and working hard to contribute their fair share, they are incentivized to just loaf.  No telling the costs to society from these freeloaders.\n\n  - Trust fund babies are far more rare than people making ~$50k<p>- Trust fund babies will not qualify for much government assistance<p>It is a net good for the economy and the individual if a person who is capable of making ~$50k does so within the workforce, rather than avoid improving their own life in order to qualify for assistance.<p>This is not a moralization of the use of government assistance, it is a criticism of the incentive structures within those assistance programs.\n\n    &gt; It is a net good for the economy [for individuals to improve their lives]<p>I agree.  If you&#x27;ve just inherited $25 million, it would <i>still</i> be better for you and for society for you to get a job--even a job paying $50k a year if that is all you could get.<p>But...are you going to be <i>incentivized</i> to do so?<p>If you care about somebody not wanting to make $50k because they&#x27;d lose a $10k subsidy, how much MORE should you care about a $25 million subsidy disincentivizing somebody to improve themselves and contribute to society as a productive citizen.<p>&gt; Trust fund babies are far more rare than people making ~$50k<p>That just means that imposing enough inheritance tax to incentivize them to work wouldn&#x27;t effect enough people to have a negative effect on the economy.  And lets not forget, the person being taxed is dead.  They will feel absolutely no ill effects from the tax.  Its all upside.<p>Not Trolling here.  I advocate a 100% inheritance tax, the proceeds of which should be dedicated to education, nutrition, and housing for the next generation, to achieve the following goal:  Equal ability should be given equal opportunity to succeed.<p>And just giving free money to one kid and nothing to another is the <i>absolute diametrical opposite</i> of that.\n\n      &gt; I advocate a 100% inheritance tax<p>What sort of nonsense half-measure is this? <i>I</i> propose a 100% tax on parent-child resource transfers starting from the moment of birth!<p>Although, you might just cut out the middleman, seize the children, and raise them in a state-run &quot;Nurturing Center.&quot;\n\n        I enjoy a gaming science fiction universe with such &quot;Clanners&quot;.<p>Fun stories do not necessarily make for fun real life experiences I imagine.\n\n        &gt; seize the children, and raise them in a state-run &quot;Nurturing Center.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know a parent who hasn&#x27;t fantasized about this.  I hadn&#x27;t considered the inheritance angle; my kid&#x27;s young yet.\n\n          Don&#x27;t worry, we will send them a bill.\n\n      Why would anyone with above-median ability to acquire resources stay in such a country\n\n        Why would anybody with above-median ability to acquire resources <i>NOT</i> want to live in a society where equal ability always means equal opportunity??\n\n      - The government created an incentive structure keeping people on government benefits from being productive members of the economy. It should fix that.<p>- There is still a question of scale: the trust-fund-baby population is several orders of magnitude smaller than the makes-50k population<p>&gt; I advocate a 100% inheritance tax<p>Well then I don&#x27;t think there is much common ground between us :) A 100% inheritance tax severely dis-incentivizes savings and investment, cutting off capital to the businesses that have created so much value over the last century.\n\n        &gt; A 100% inheritance tax severely dis-incentivizes savings<p>Sure, but how much value have we lost because talented kids didn&#x27;t get the education they needed?  How much are we being harmed right now because a mediocre, but wealthy person is holding an office which could be better done by somebody who was excluded through no fault of their own&#x2F;&#x2F;\n\n          The people with that kind of money don&#x27;t have borders restricting them.<p>Anyway you&#x27;re wasting your time because these people are lawmakers.\n\n            &gt; The people with that kind of money don&#x27;t have borders restricting them.<p>Anybody who would leave a country which gave them so much--just so they could take EVEN MORE from it--is somebody I don&#x27;t want voting in my elections anyways.<p>Good Riddance.  Either grab an oar and start rowing with the rest of us, or get off the boat.<p>&gt; Anyway you&#x27;re wasting your time<p>No doubt I am.   But when people come on here and complain about somebody making $40k a year getting a subsidy for their health care, it&#x27;s fair to hold them to their own standard.  You are against handouts, I get it.  Well what about that handout you got from your parents when they kicked off, on set up that trust fund?<p>You want people to be incentivized to contribute to society, I get it.  Well, if giving somebody $10k to subsidize their health care is a bad incentive, what about giving somebody $25 million?<p>If it&#x27;s bad for people to just be arbitrarily handed free money, so be it.  Let everybody start from exactly the same starting line, and let them go as fast and as far as their talents can take them.  But they don&#x27;t get to just give free money to people, even their kids, because apparently, that&#x27;s bad.\n\n              Here&#x27;s who&#x27;s getting money<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39765718\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39765718</a><p>People and organizations that understand what&#x27;s important to keeping the American Empire strong and gas prices low and offer to deliver.<p>They aren&#x27;t going anywhere.

How about New Zealand and Australia? I really wonder<p>The US already spends more on health per capita even excluding the costs of drugs. It&#x27;s not because some random put money into Bitcoin in 2006 and is now a a near billionaire. Or because they won the lottery. There&#x27;s an entire system eating away at the money and even Amazon couldn&#x27;t fight it. You&#x27;ll have better luck getting rid of the TSA\n\n                Alright, fess up, this is a post from a bot!\n\n                  You can find my phone number online. My time zone is UTC+1.<p>Call me and hear my very African accent\n\nThe problem is labels, and beyond that political parties. Politicians like labels because the parties depend on labels for branding. They want to use rhetoric to group people, like “poor” or “rich” and the second you do that you create the discontinuity.<p>Avoiding benefit cliffs requires more than understanding the issue of discontinuities, it requires the reduction of identity politics which neither party is on board with. Parties themselves are labels. They cater to the human desire to simplify and form tribes around those labels.\n\n&gt; However, a tax system that encourages people to lose money, perhaps by funneling it to (on average) much wealthier options traders by buying put options, seems sub-optimal.<p>In expectation, they&#x27;re likely not really funneling that much money to options traders. Indeed - if the option pays out, they likely will not have to worry about medicare&#x2F;healthcare for quite some time.\n\nI remember my deep disquiet at a tax return where my reportable income was exactly 2^n-1 for some integer n, naturally provoking obsessive checking and audit on my part.\n\nIt&#x27;s interesting how the marathon discrepancies mostly disappear at left and right of the curve (looking at 2:30 and 6:30). Presumably top runners are putting out 100% of sustainable effort the whole time so there&#x27;s no reserve energy and the slowest are similarly doing all they can just to get the race done. The folks in the middle are the ones who are putting in something less than 100%.\n\nFor those of you that are fans of Jon Bois, he once noted in a video that the statistics for ball placement by an NFL ref is notably skewed towards 5 yard lines.<p>Because, he thought, refs are human.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons that means tested, rather than universal programs end up producing perverse outcomes. People in countries with universal healthcare, daycare and education do not have to limit their participation or productivity in the real economy in order to access essential services.\n\nMarginal rate discontinuities in the UK income tax system [0] are driving highly undesirable (from the taxman&#x27;s point of view) behaviour. The increase in marginal tax rate from £100K p.a. upwards has already led to:<p>- doctors going part-time to keep their income below £100K, in the middle of a shortage of doctors across the health system<p>- employees turning down promotions because with the combined effects of income tax, student loan repayments and loss of childcare subsidy the effective marginal rate of income tax between £100K and £117K is &gt; 100% (!)<p>- single high earners (core voters of the present government) effectively subsidising families of middling earners (the opposition&#x27;s core voters) because the discontinuities apply to single person&#x27;s income, not combined household income<p>The behaviour changes are simple first order effects. The second order effects on public service workforce availability and overall tax take were also highly predictable.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;archive&#x2F;03270&#x2F;tax_3270753a.PNG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;archive&#x2F;03270&#x2F;tax_327...</a>\n\n  But these tax rates are all under the current government, why would single high earners vote for it?\n\n  If I understand the linked chart, there are discontinuities in the <i>marginal</i> tax rate, not the effective tax rate. So in that case yeah at certain levels the amount you owe on each additional dollar goes up, but that would not mean that making 105k is worse than 100k unless the marginal tax rate is greater than 100%.<p>This ignores stuff like losing childcare subsidies that is likely not included on the graph.<p>In the us you hear stories of people decreasing their income to be in a lower tax bracket and often it is due to them not understanding that the tax brackets are for marginal tax rates.\n\n    &gt; If I understand the linked chart, there are discontinuities in the &lt;i&gt;marginal&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; tax rate, not the effective tax rate.<p>True, but they are <i>harsh</i> discontinuities, sufficiently so to have the effects I described. And yes, there is a common combination of personal circumstances (high income plus student loan repayments plus child care subsidies) which means that any gross salary between £100K and £117K means less net income than being on £99,999 gross. I&#x27;ve not been able find a graph for that, but the maths checks out.<p>The result of this particular combination is to effectively impose a ceiling on many employees at £100K gross, because they would have to receive a greater than 17% pay rise to be better off than before.\n\n    &gt; there are discontinuities in the marginal tax rate, not the effective tax rate<p>This is often claimed. And the whole point of the article and much of this discussion is that no, there are often major steps &#x2F; discontinuities in the overall tax rate. In the US, the many ACA discontinuities just by themselves are large and do not effectively pay attention to the bottom line. For that matter, I don&#x27;t know of a single country or US state that actually &quot;runs on effective tax rate&quot;. Which might be a solution to the problem if anyone were actually looking for a solution to the problem.\n\n  Decreasing marginal rate thresholds on UK income tax (like going from 60% at 125,139 to 40% at 125,140) is insane and leads to wacky optimisations like the following:<p>Suppose you predicably earn 150k a year. Taking 110k per year salary and putting 40k in your pension for four years results in less net income than:<p>* Taking 140k salary and 10k pension in year one<p>* Take 100k salary and 50k pension in years two, three, and four<p>In both cases you have taken 440k salary and put 160k in your pension. But in the first case you have paid highest tax rate of 60% tax rate on 40k and in the second case you paid the highest tax rate of 60% on only 12,570.<p>Since the annual pension allowance is now 60k per year, and you have a three year carry-forward to use unused pension allowance from previous years you can do this trick with quite a wide range of gross salaries. And you can use it for the 125,139 to 125,140 decreasing marginal rate, or the 59,999 to 60,000 decreasing marginal rate due loss of child benefit.\n\n“Some other discontinuities are the TANF income limit, the Medicaid income limit, the CHIP income limit for free coverage, and the CHIP income limit for reduced-cost coverage.”<p>I know more than one person who intentionally keep low, part-time hours for this. One had a good, work ethic when on the job. Just didn’t want to lose those benefits.<p>Policy makers should definitely weight this into any decisions about reforms.\n\nWe have some discontinuities in our tax code in Argentina, if you are an independent worker, and earn up to 11,916,410 pesos ($11,682) per year, you pay 793,332 pesos ($777) in taxes, around 6.6%, but if you earn one more peso, you enter the general regime, and start paying &gt;50% in taxes.\n\n  A simple solution (probably used in many places) to this problem is to have brackets. Everybody is taxed 6.6% on its income until a certain threshold and the rest is taxed at 50%. You can add more brackets as needed. And so, there is no incentive to be just bellow a certain bracket threshold.\n\nThis article is so straightforward and well articulated to hammer in the main concept: statistics are funky!!\n\nOkay but can we talk about how beautiful that Polish language exam score histogram is?\n\nIs this true? You can&#x27;t mark cap losses against income to reduce income more than a few thousand. You have to actively make less, not make bad investments.\n\n  &gt; You can&#x27;t mark cap losses against income to reduce income more than a few thousand.<p>You can if a significant part of your income is capital gains.\n\nDuring the pandemic, as was the case for many organizations, my employer implemented pay cuts. In the name of fairness, they did it by income so that those with the highest incomes would pay a larger percentage. That sounds good, but they did it with discontinuities.<p>What upset me was couples with combined salaries far greater than mine but individually a little less so they were just below the cutoff. Their combined cut on considerably more income was less than mine. We were living on one income, and the cuts would have been tough to absorb if not for the stimulus checks.\n\nI don&#x27;t think this is a problem about &quot;discontinuity&quot;. It&#x27;s about the monotonicity of the function from income before tax (and insurance, etc.) to income after tax. So I don&#x27;t think &quot;sharp threshold&quot; is a problem, as long as the law is &quot;if you are making more than this amount, <i>the extra part</i> should be taxed at a higher rate.&quot;<p>From other comments I learn that some laws indeed do not work like this. Really?! That&#x27;s awful.\n\nh\n\nThresholds are almost always a bad solution (in engineering or otherwise) - the only advantage I have found for them is that they are usually easier to understand than the alternative.\n\nSpecific to the welfare&#x2F;UBI&#x2F;public benefits subthread of this (with a digression):<p>I saw the phrase &quot;middle class solution to lower class problem [&#x27;MCSLCP&#x27;]&quot; applied to stuff like this years ago; that characterisation is possibly not politically correct today.  It was discussing various forms of &#x27;credit fine print&#x27; --- the ad for &quot;Buy this recliner today, no interest, no payments for three months!!!&quot; ... followed by five lines of fine print at the bottom of the ad (likely double the verbiage of this posting) about need to pay promptly, the upfront fees, etc etc, and the (somewhat usurious) rates and fees payable if the process wasn&#x27;t followed to the letter.<p>What makes it &#x27;MCSLCP&#x27; is that for a large percentage of the population that would look at this, if you have the time &#x2F; savvy to assess the deal and make it work, you probably have better credit options available.  [1]<p>It&#x27;s super easy to comply with the terms if you have a personal organization system (&#x27;tickler&#x27;) that works.  Maintaining that system is really tough if you&#x27;re a single parent&#x2F;double job trying to keep the ship afloat... and also to have the funds to keep the deal working on the day that the tickler is triggered.<p>But the &#x27;MCS&#x27; of the MCSLCP is, just buy it with the cash-back credit card, and pay the balance in full before the due date.  Easy percentage, and you already do that as part of the monthly bill-payment chore.<p>For the vendor, the deal is a moneymaker since the majority of the takers will not (be able to) comply with the letter of the terms, and the fees and rates become the profit.<p>The public benefit aspect is that, the space to screw it up and lose the benefits is politically a feature, not a bug.  The legislators can paint themselves as guardians of the public purse and the people who blew the cliff as thwarted welfare cheats.<p>[1] if I could &#x27;ping&#x27; patio11 on this... I think some recent posts from &#x27;bits about money&#x27; are in the same area as this.\n\nI disagree with the proposed solutions, all way to complex. The thing to do is simply give the subsidy to everyone and make up for it with higher taxes. That is how you achieve more equable outcomes, give fixed subsidies to everyone and recover via proportional taxes.<p>Instead we end up with a situation where we have arbitrary cutoffs, a large buerocracy just checking for eligibility and often even progressive subsidies (giving more to those with higher incomes)\n\nI love the example with Russian elections! It&#x27;s impressive that they allow themselves to be that low-effort in their fake results.\n\nThere&#x27;s also Poincare and the Bakery [0], which is quite possibly apocryphal but often told - esentially a departure from the normal disibution showing something odd going on.<p>I vaguely recall reading that the technique was used in the second world war to catch black marketers; if the distribution of weights of rationed items had a discontinuity near the weight limit, it was evidence that the seller was keeping the heavier portions back for private sales.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;houstonstatisticians.wordpress.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;poincare-and-the-bakery&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;houstonstatisticians.wordpress.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;poinca...</a>\n\nI suspect the inconvenience and weirdness of dealing with a hard cut-off is easier than the complexity of dealing with some kind of continuous scale. Laws need to be, first of all, easily comprehensible so that all parties can plan accordingly. It&#x27;s easy enough to plan to keep your income under $X, but hard to figure out the optimum benefit&#x2F;income sliding scale and plan accordingly. The only other simple and fair option I can think of would be to implement a &quot;judge&quot; to issue approval on a case-by-case basis instead of a hard number.\n\nThis happens in other countries as well. An option here is to donate to a charity. It is tax-deductible, carries no risk of accidentally making you more money, and typically does some good instead of lining the pockets of the wealthy.<p>Do check if that would work for you before wasting money on useless put options.\n\nWe have some of these in the UK tax system, some of which are being resolved (or at least improved) but many which aren&#x27;t.<p>Currently, if you have a child, you&#x27;re entitled to a cash payment called child benefit. For a first child it&#x27;s worth £26 per week and then any subsequent children you&#x27;d get £15.90 per week. However, you only get this if the highest earner&#x27;s income is below £50,000. Between £50k and £60k, it&#x27;s on a sliding scale, so at £55k you get 50%, £57.5k you get 25%, etc.<p>Side effects of this are that if you have two earners both on £49999, you get the full amount, and one earner on £60000 you get nothing. It means there&#x27;s a crazily high effective marginal rate on people. If you put money into your pension, it can bring you down below the threshold again, so many people (if they can afford to) will do this.<p>From next month, they&#x27;re changing the threshold to £60-80k over which it drops off, which is a big improvement, but the marginal tax rate effect is still there."

From the FAQ:<p>&gt; The ADS-B data used by this map includes information on the accuracy of the navigation system used by each aircraft, but doesn&#x27;t specify the type of navigation system. It could be GPS, another global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like GLONASS, or it could be an inertial navigation system (INS). My understanding is that most aircraft are using GPS, so that&#x27;s probably mostly what the map shows.\n\n    Flightradar24&#x27;s visual representation definitely sucks, but comparing the two, gpsjam has a lot of unexpected missing areas across Africa, South America, and SE Asia that at least have some data on FR24.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that means FR24 has a better dataset, or they&#x27;re processing it differently or if they&#x27;re just extrapolating from few data points when they maybe shouldn&#x27;t be.\n\nIt would be awesome if they published this data more openly for academic use!<p>Edit: Looks like they might source their data from commercial ADSB providers. Bummer\n\n  They are the commercial ADSB provider\n\nHey, I&#x27;m living in one of these cells in Germany. Hmm.\n\n  They are fairly large cells. I assume the “bad” cells are displaying some maxima-based aggregate rather than implying the whole area (or a large part of it) in them is noticeably jammed.\n\n    Also, the reports are coming from aircraft which have a much larger horizon at altitude. The jamming from Kaliningrad probably doesn&#x27;t have any effect on the ground at long distances.\n\n  Turn off WiFi location in your phone and see how long it takes for it to get a GPS fix, or if it never gets one.\n\nMany of the patches are not surprising, but why is a small area between Germany and Sweden jammed?\n\n  A small area between Estonia and Finland likewise.\n\n    Any chance the area being referenced in relation to Germany is near the headquarters of a company named aaronia? They manufacture, high-end spectrum rf analyzers, and high-end drone tracking and jamming&#x2F;drone disabling equipment.  \n(As a result, I would expect them to be testing, and or demonstrating their equipment near their headquarters.)<p>Just a guess&#x2F;speculation as I’m familiar with aaronia’s products and services (indirectly)\n\n      If any civilian company jammed GPS enough to affect commercial aviation that would be a huge no-no - RF emissions in places like Germany are strictly controlled, even if you&#x27;re just &#x27;testing&#x27;\n\n  If you click through some different days, it looks like that is just a patch of the larger overall jamming zone around Kaliningrad.\n\nI wonder why there&#x27;s some jamming near a small section of the Texas&#x2F;Mexico border?\n\n  Cartels disrupting law enforcement, and&#x2F;or vice versa.\n\n  Drug Cartels most likely. That area is frequently jammed.\n\n  That is Eagle Pass, TX. The infamous, massive border crossing area where suspected criminal border crossers are corraled under the bridge, where Elon visited, etc.<p>The jamming is done to make crossing the border without going through the checkpoint more difficult\n\n    Is there some official source for that? If so, is it just GPS or do other GNSS constellations get jammed too?\n\n      Since even phones can receive and understand the other systems&#x27; signals, if one wants to jam, one would probably jam them all...\n\n    Do these cartels only operate during normal US workday hours and observe US federal holidays?\n\n    That&#x27;s north of Eagle Pass.  Laughlin AFB is on the southwestern edge of those two red cells.  Eagle Pass is like 50-60 miles south.\n\n  I&#x27;m curious as well. My first thought was cartels, but it&#x27;s also right over Laughlin AFB.\n\n  You&#x27;re not the only person: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;group&#x2F;scpnt&#x2F;gpslab&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Liu_ION_ITM_2023_ADSB.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;group&#x2F;scpnt&#x2F;gpslab&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Liu_...</a><p>TL;DR: It&#x27;s weak signal, not jamming. The weak signal reports come from military training aircraft carrying out maneuvers that cause temporary signal loss.\n\n    really? unless they&#x27;re jamming it, how would that happen?\n\n      Rapidly execute a series of maneuvers (flips, rolls) that cause the radios to lose signal.\n\n        So I&#x27;m a little skeptical on that front because military aircraft are still not that often broadcasting ADSB even during routine flights, at least in my (also close to the border) region. In theory the Air Force was supposed to have completed ADSB installation on their fleet last year but they blew the deadline pretty bad on even installing transponders, and of course they still reserve the right to disable them during military operations.<p>Maybe with the data we can figure out what portion of military flights are included?<p>For the helicopter training flights that I notice most often, it&#x27;s still rare to see one that broadcasts ADSB, probably &lt;10%. C-130s usually don&#x27;t either here but it&#x27;s more often, maybe more like 25%. Perhaps for other categories of aircraft they&#x27;ve installed more transponders. But in the city where I live, even passive mode-C MLAT is probably around 50% success on tracking military flights for ADSB Exchange. FlightAware might have better coverage for mode-C. mode-C can&#x27;t contribute to this GPS reliability data anyway but it illustrates that even C-130 pattern practice is sometimes &quot;stealth&quot; from a radio perspective due to the low installation rates for ADSB and difficulty of good mode-C coverage.<p>The paper linked elsewhere (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;group&#x2F;scpnt&#x2F;gpslab&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Liu_ION_ITM_2023_ADSB.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;group&#x2F;scpnt&#x2F;gpslab&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Liu_...</a>) mentioned issues with military training flights resulting in spurious low-NIC cases but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t quantify it. With the way the AF rollout has gone it probably depends on the specific installation, command, and aircraft type.<p>In the border region specifically we would tend to expect the majority of non-military flights to be civilian CBP aircraft that aren&#x27;t performing unusual maneuvers. CBP has a somewhat complicated and limited authority to disable ADS-B that I don&#x27;t know the contours of, I&#x27;m not sure how often they do so on their larger (non-sUAS) aircraft. Involvement of the Air National Guard in the Texas area might complicate the analysis though.\n\n          How does not having ADSB impact air control?\n\n            ATC is used to working with military aircraft without ADSB since it&#x27;s been the status quo (and keep in mind that ADSB is not required on aircraft in general, although the set of airspace situations in which it&#x27;s required has been expanded over the years to become a de facto near universal mandate). But the FAA doesn&#x27;t like it, which is why they set the deadline for the Air Force to install ADSB, which the Air Force missed.<p>Military aircraft on military maneuvers don&#x27;t deal with FAA ATC, the military has its own controllers. It&#x27;s mostly an issue when they&#x27;re operating near civilian airports (or the many, many military facilities that share an airfield with an airport). There are still adverse safety impacts to the lack of ADSB on many military aircraft, in that it defeats things like TCAS.<p>Actually this topic is slightly complex and I think a lot of people have misconceptions, so let&#x27;s lay it out. These rules have gotten stricter and stricter in recent years.<p>1. ADSB is not required. Meaning, there is no universal requirement that aircraft be equipped with ADSB, and plenty of aircraft still legally operate without.<p>2. ADSB <i>is</i> required in class A, B, C, in many cases in class E, and within the &quot;Mode-C veil&quot; surrounding major airports.<p>3. ADSB is required in any case where a transponder is required, for those edge cases that are not included in the above.<p>4. The result is that the areas in which you can legally operate without ADS-B are mostly limited to low altitudes in rural areas. Of course, this encompasses a large portion of hobby aviation especially, but not very much commercial flight.\n\n          I can say that in San Antonio where I live and also operate a ADSB receiver the dedicated air force flight trainers (T38 Talons and T6 Texans) routinely fly with ADSB on. The C5 cargo plans also fly with ADSB on when doing training but I&#x27;ve seen non-training flights fly overhead with ADSB off.<p>I can actually receive high flighting planes over Del Rio so it would be interesting to see if they are reporting bad NIC values.\n\n          I thought Mode C was just barometric pressure data measured by the aircraft. It&#x27;s related to altitude, not position, so there&#x27;s no such thing as Mode C &quot;coverage&quot;.<p>e; oh wait you said passive MLAT off Mode C, that makes more sense then\n\n    Yep, this map doesn&#x27;t show jamming.  It shows weak signals, of which jamming is one potential cause.  An airplane pointing their GPS receiver at the ground will also cause a weak signal.\n\n      How does an airplane &quot;point their GPS receiver at the ground&quot; (for an extended period of time since a combined GNSS&#x2F;INS positioning solution, which is what all airliners use at this point as far as I know, will need an extended signal loss to report decreased accuracy)?\n\n        Probably something like this<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ynvoriv09Ks?t=105\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ynvoriv09Ks?t=105</a>\n\n          Ah, is this Ryanair&#x27;s plan to divest from their all-Boeing fleet? :)<p>It should be pretty simple for Flightradar24 to exclude non-commercial aircraft from the data through, which would solve that problem.<p>There&#x27;s also tons of data available in the ADS-B signal that should help distinguish between aircraft-motion-induced outages and actual jamming: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mode-s.org&#x2F;decode&#x2F;content&#x2F;ads-b&#x2F;7-uncertainty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mode-s.org&#x2F;decode&#x2F;content&#x2F;ads-b&#x2F;7-uncertainty.html</a>\n\n            From the FAQ, it sounds like they simply presume that anywhere with multiple low NIC values is indicative of interference.<p>&gt; The GPS interference data is derived from NIC (navigation integrity category) values that we receive as part of the ADS-B protocol. We mark regions as affected if a significant number of flights in that area report lowered NIC values.\n\n            Unfortunately some of the data that&#x27;s most directly applicable to determining aircraft attitude, like roll, is optional and rarely sent by aircraft, but yes I&#x27;m sure you could do a decent job of inferring maneuvering from change in heading and vertical rate (especially if you&#x27;re looking at ADS-B data with high temporal resolution vs., say, every 10-60 seconds.)\n\n          on a pure radar scan, what would return of formation flying like this look like to a radar operator? is it just one large dot, or can they distinguish the number of planes in the formation?\n\n        It happens when you are giving the bird.\n\n    That&#x27;s a good link (that I should have posted). I suspect that some of the yellow (maybe even red) hexes in the U.S., and maybe some in Europe too, are due to that effect.<p>For people doubting that aircraft maneuvering can affect navigation accuracy as reported by ADS-B, I found a fun example. Around 1300 UTC today (0800 Texas time), 4 T-38s took off from Laughlin AFB for what looks like training, with lots of maneuvering. This link shows what it looks like when mapped in 2D: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=adffc3,adfff9,adffd2,ae0041&amp;lat=29.432&amp;lon=-100.750&amp;zoom=9.5&amp;showTrace=2024-03-20&amp;trackLabels\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=adffc3,adfff9,adffd2,ae...</a><p>Here&#x27;s a 60 second segment of the track of one of those jets, STEER21, that captures a steep turn and dive: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=adfff9&amp;lat=30.067&amp;lon=-100.555&amp;zoom=13.4&amp;showTrace=2024-03-20&amp;startTime=17:00&amp;endTime=17:01&amp;trackLabels&amp;timestamp=1710954030\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=adfff9&amp;lat=30.067&amp;lon=-...</a><p>If you click on the track, you can inspect the ADS-B data at that point in time in the sidebar on the left. If you scroll to the bottom of that sidebar, there&#x27;s an &quot;ACCURACY&quot; section, that shows the Estimated Position Uncertainty (EPU). You can see it change from better than &lt; 30 meter uncertainty to &gt; 18.5 km(!) uncertainty as it performs the maneuver.<p>I made a video that shows how to see those values, and also shows the maneuver in a 3D viewer so you can see how steep the dive is (it&#x27;s steep!): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jfHlpnEdHxw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jfHlpnEdHxw</a><p>(The viewer uses a generic aircraft model, FYI, don&#x27;t be distracted by that.)\n\n  Can&#x27;t the US military turn it off in some areas.  Law enforcement wouldn&#x27;t have to jam.\n\nIs the data actually interesting? I feel like any place that would have widespread jamming would also see routing away of non-military aircraft meaning you&#x27;d never see the jamming taking place except if you happen to get lucky and the jamming zone is larger than the &quot;stay out&quot; zone. This makes sense then why the map is entirely green with some red just at the periphery of Ukraine with the majority of Ukraine having no data since it&#x27;s a no-fly zone for civilian traffic.\n\n  The jamming over Kaliningrad affecting civil aviation has made the news recently, and the map does provide some interesting insights both how far the effect reaches into Poland and Sweden, and how often it is turned on and off.\n\n  If you read the article, jamming is based on uncertainty of the aircraft, just because it&#x27;s uncertain, doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s dangerous level of uncertainty\n\n  This is a case where nominally, with a solid understanding of geopolitical events, maybe it&#x27;s not interesting on average. BUT, all of a sudden something might pop up one day. The accessible, &quot;crowdsourced&quot; data is helpful to have in those cases.\n\nWhy in the world is there so much jamming in Turkey? What&#x27;s going on?\n\n  Iran maybe?\n\n    Red dots are in the north of Turkey. I don&#x27;t think that Iran reaches there.\n\n  Turkey has been jamming GPS for years. I can&#x27;t find a good explanation.\n\n  To the north is the Black Sea, and the Russia-Ukraine war. To the east is Armenia and Azerbaijan (as well as Iran). To the south is the middle east. Also Cyprus with the frozen conflict, there.\n\n    In addition to Armenia&#x2F;Azerbaijan, Turkey has had a significant internal conflict with the PKK (Kurds) in the East&#x2F;South East for... a very long time.<p>Also that whole region is just patchy with flight data - it makes it difficult to really see the true shape of jamming.\n\n      &gt; Turkey has had a significant internal conflict with the PKK (Kurds)<p>PKK the terrorist organization, yes.

Kurds the ethnic group, no.<p>The Turkish government has a decades long history of discrimination against Kurds, including banning their language, even denying their existence as a people. If Turkey had treated Kurds better, PKK may well have never existed, and almost certainly would not have had as many Kurds supporting it even if it still had.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Denial_of_Kurds_by_Turkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Denial_of_Kurds_by_Turkey</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Xenophobia_and_discrimination_in_Turkey#Against_Kurds\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Xenophobia_and_discrimination_...</a>\n\n          Turkish Government has had many high-ranking Kurdish officials, including multiple presidents and prime ministers.<p>There have been more Kurds served in the Turkish Army than all the other armed organizations combined.<p>Majority of Kurds in Turkey openly support the Turkish Government, especially against the PKK terror.<p>Several Kurdish organizations in Iraq, Syria, and Iran support the Turkish Government, especially against the PKK terror.<p>PKK kills Kurds. PKK kills Turks. PKK will happily kill you if doing so benefits the crime and propaganda business they have been profiting for decades.<p>Let&#x27;s not parrot some politically charged material as facts without having any actual understanding about such sensitive matter.\n\n            According to Wikipedia [0]:<p>&gt; The Kurdish language was banned in a large portion of Kurdistan for some time. After the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état until 1991 the use of the Kurdish language was illegal in Turkey.[52]<p>&gt; Before August 2002, the Turkish government placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media.[55][56] In March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in Kurdish. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children&#x27;s cartoons, or educational programs that teach Kurdish, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week<p>It is true that over the last 20 years or so, the Turkish government has relaxed many (but not all) of its anti-Kurdish laws and policies. But that doesn&#x27;t erase the reality of the decades of oppression which proceeded it.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kurdish_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kurdish_language</a>\n\n              In the 1980s, Iraqi Kurds were fleeing to Turkey for freedom and safety. The Prime Minister was of Kurdish origin. You could hear people speak Kurdish freely anywhere between the west and east end of the country.<p>There were no &quot;anti-Kurdish&quot; laws and policies. The pro-American coup d&#x27;état in 1980 came with a law to control non-Turkish publications, but it was never put into action.\n\n                &gt; There were no &quot;anti-Kurdish&quot; laws and policies.<p>Here&#x27;s a 1999 Human Rights Watch report – &quot;RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE&quot; – <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;1999&#x2F;turkey&#x2F;turkey993-08.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;1999&#x2F;turkey&#x2F;turkey993-08.htm</a>\n\n                  You can&#x27;t just dump links to 10,000-word political essays, and expect them to support your original premise that the PKK terrorism is justified.<p>You must have a knowledge about the history and currency of the topic to hold such strong opinions. You should also use your own words to articulate your arguments, so I can keep myself engaged in this conversation.<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve read the report. It misinterprets the government&#x27;s certain actions to protect the public against several jihadist, separatist, and other destructive movements, which are not exclusive to a specific ethnic group.<p>It also fails to recognize the newly founded republic&#x27;s goal to build an inclusive Turkish citizenship identity, and to provide a progressive and secular education program to everyone regardless of their race, religion, and gender while preserving the cultural value of each.<p>&quot;Kurdish&quot; isn&#x27;t a single language anyway. There is a reason Kurds use French in France, English in USA&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Canada, and Turkish in every part of Turkey to communicate with each other, unless they&#x27;re from the same tribe. It&#x27;s not realistically possible to institute a system to provide public service to every individual without establishing a common ground.\n\n                    &gt; You can&#x27;t just dump links to 10,000-word political essays,<p>I&#x27;m citing reputable sources, your reply is just your own say-so.<p>If you don&#x27;t like Human Rights Watch, how about the European Commission?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;projects&#x2F;success-stories&#x2F;all&#x2F;echr-and-human-rights-violations-against-kurds-turkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;pro...</a><p>&gt; and expect them to support your original premise that the PKK terrorism is justified.<p>I&#x27;m not defending attacks on innocent civilians. Consider Northern Ireland: the IRA&#x27;s attacks on civilians were shameful and wrong. But, if it were not for the oppression of Catholics by the Stormont government, and the failure of the UK government to stop it, those attacks may well have never started.\n\n                      You&#x27;re trying to connect the dots between two separate phenomenons. This oversimplification will only mislead you.<p>You&#x27;d think that your left-wing instincts will guide you through this, but you will accidentally end up taking ugly sides in proxy wars in this part of the world.<p>PKK started out according to CIA&#x27;s Operation Gladio to justify the 1980 coup, and continued operating in line with the Carter Doctrine. Its first actions were assassinating Kurdish and Turkish left-wing leaders (Zeki Ön, Mehmet Ongan, Adil Turan, Hasan Erkılıç to name a few).<p>Today, PKK follows the radical Islamist narratives (Şeyh Said, Seyit Rıza, etc. are often celebrated by them). PKK is in agreement with an Islamist terrorist organization (FETÖ) behind the 2016 coup attempt, whose leader (Fethullah Gülen) resides in the US. PKK conducts international drug trafficking at &quot;cartel&quot; scale (between Asia and Europe; ask your neighborhood drug dealer about it). PKK is backed by several crime syndicates and tribes who are responsible for countless human rights violations from systematic child&#x2F;woman abuse to forced labour and human trafficking. PKK is currently taking part in the ethnic cleansing of Arabic, Turkish, Assyrian population in Syria and Iraq to make a space for an American-backed puppet state under &quot;YPG&quot; alias.<p>How is your IRA-PKK correlation shaping up now?<p>Your &quot;reputable sources&quot; are compilations of quotes by &quot;usual suspects&quot; anyway. Western organizations are not known for being the gold standard of social justice advocacy here, as they have a history of endorsing any &quot;project&quot; that fits their financial and political agenda; from cyanide process in gold mining, to civil warfare for carving up sovereign states.\n\nSo how should I interpret this? The map lacks geopolitical boundaries, so it&#x27;s hard to interpret.<p>There looks like a big hole of no data over Ukraine, where I&#x27;d most expect GPS jamming, but I suppose there are no civilian flights either. Maybe they could setup an GPS observation station on the ground at a surveyed point to get data there.<p>There&#x27;s a big red blob over Turkey, is that maybe the southern edge of the reach of Russian jammers in the Black sea?<p>There&#x27;s also a big red blob over the eastern Mediterranean.  Is that Israel? I&#x27;m not so sure though, because it&#x27;s not centered on Israel and parts of Israel proper are green on the map. I also assume they&#x27;re heavy users of GPS, so wouldn&#x27;t want to jam it.<p>There&#x27;s a red blob in Southeast Asia, and that looks like Myanmar, where there&#x27;s a civil war right now.<p>There&#x27;s a little red blob over what looks like Kashmir.\n\n  I was curious too. Did some sleuthing, it looks more like Punjab. I think that’s to block drone infiltration from Pakistan [1]. It does change going back to 14th March there is no jamming in the region, US and Europe blobs also reduced, so I think this stuff is event driven, wonder what goes on, fascinating stuff.<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thehindu.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national&#x2F;other-states&#x2F;over-100-pakistani-drones-recovered-from-punjab-border-in-2023-bsf&#x2F;article67695052.ece\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thehindu.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national&#x2F;other-states&#x2F;over-100...</a>\n\n    Or could it be related to the farmer protests?\n\n  Their data comes from commercial flights. If there are no flights, there&#x27;s no data. There aren&#x27;t many commercial flights over Ukraine or Belarus right now, so that whole area&#x27;s empty.\n\n    ADS-B is only commercial flights? I thought many kinds of flights are broadcasting. Does Flightradar24 only track commercial flights?\n\n      I doubt there’s any private flights over Ukraine too. Military planes generally don’t advertise their location in combat zones\n\n        &gt; Military planes generally don’t advertise their location in combat zones<p>They might if they are from countries neutral to that conflict, like NATO flights over the Black Sea.\n\n        No flights at all.<p>About three or four civilian aircrafts were able to leave Ukraine during the war and every departure was a major military operation to undertake.\n\n      It tracks private flights too. I&#x27;m only tangentially familiar (though I have an ADS-B receiver reporting to FR24), but my understanding is that it&#x27;s not required for private flight now, but more and more aircraft are being retrofitted.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s more about airspace:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aopa.org&#x2F;go-fly&#x2F;aircraft-and-ownership&#x2F;ads-b&#x2F;where-is-ads-b-out-required\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aopa.org&#x2F;go-fly&#x2F;aircraft-and-ownership&#x2F;ads-b&#x2F;whe...</a><p>&quot;The FAA requires ADS-B Out capability in the continental United States, in the ADS-B rule airspace designated by FAR 91.225:<p>Class A, B, and C airspace;<p>Class E airspace at or above 10,000 feet msl, excluding airspace at and below 2,500 feet agl;<p>Within 30 nautical miles of a Class B primary airport (the Mode C veil);<p>Above the ceiling and within the lateral boundaries of Class B or Class C airspace up to 10,000 feet;<p>Class E airspace over the Gulf of Mexico, at and above 3,000 feet msl, within 12 nm of the U.S. coast.&quot;\n\n  The hole over Ukraine is definitely the lack of civilian flights.<p>Another notable spot is Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave. It looks relatively normal on some days, like today, but on others like yesterday it&#x27;s covered by solid red stretching far into Poland, Sweden and even Germany.\n\n    &gt; Another notable spot is Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave. It looks relatively normal on some days, like today, but on others like yesterday it&#x27;s solid red.<p>Oh yeah, I totally forgot that was a thing, and that explains that spur of red in the Baltic. I&#x27;d (probably incorrectly) assumed it was some kind of spillover from jamming in Ukraine.<p>I didn&#x27;t realize you could look at it over multiple days. One interesting thing about that blob is the <i>outline</i> of red seems to always be there, in the same shape, but the middle is often green. Maybe that&#x27;s some artifact of their agreement algorithm? More overflights around the edges than through?<p>It also looks like there&#x27;s some jamming in Estonia? Or maybe that&#x27;s just the edge of jamming around St Petersburg?\n\n      Russians do plenty of jamming that expands beyond their borders in the Baltic, either on purpose or just as a spillover as they don&#x27;t care. Before Finland joined NATO they used to also violate our airspace on frequent basis, but since then that has stopped.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yle.fi&#x2F;a&#x2F;74-20079715\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yle.fi&#x2F;a&#x2F;74-20079715</a>\n\n        They violated NATO airspace a lot with their &quot;Bear&quot; nuclear-capable bombers until very recently. Not sure if it&#x27;s still happening. It was so frequent that it didn&#x27;t make the news every time.\n\n          The idea that russians are doing these things &#x27;by accident&#x27; ain&#x27;t even funny, just dangerously naive and nobody from intelligence community thinks so. They know damn well what they do and its well planned and even heroic in some childish fashion in their f*cked up mindset.<p>They are at war with west (more Europe than US though) for solid 2 decades straight, just that they started to use military only in last decade, but were subverting public opinions in usual command &amp; conquer strategy for much longer (riling western and former soviet populations against EU and Nato, supporting ultra-right groups, spreading false rumors  ie on covid in us vs them psi-ops).<p>Whatever politicians on their side say is meaningless or diversion and definitely just wasted time, just look at actions alone.\n\n            I never said it was by accident. It surely isn&#x27;t.\n\n        &gt; <i>Before Finland joined NATO they used to also violate our airspace on frequent basis, but since then that has stopped.</i><p>Probably temporarily. They violate the Estonian airspace on a regular basis with military planes, with their responders turned off. The NATO planes stationed in Estonia then take off and go see them off.\n\n  hole = no measurement\n\n  Yea, oddly, if you go back to like august, there&#x27;s still a bunch of red over the Mediterranean, parts of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, etc. so it&#x27;s not totally clear what that is. I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally that gps has gotten unusable in Israel in recent weeks but it&#x27;s not clear why that&#x27;s changed based on the mapping information we&#x27;re seeing here.\n\n    Northern Israel is completely jammed. There&#x27;s talk of Israelis getting matched on Tinder with women from Beirut.\n\n      That’s because Beirut is 60 miles from northern Israel and Tinder’s max is 100 miles IIRC. These are small countries we’re talking about here.<p>Phones don’t use GPS these days if they can help it - WiFi triangulation is significantly faster and uses much less battery - so GPS jamming wouldn’t have anything to do with Tinder matches.\n\n        This didn&#x27;t happen before the war started.\n\n          Probably some new-age hippies at Tinder taking the &#x27;make love, not war&#x27; manta to heart. &#x2F;s\n\n  I see 2 red cells on the US&#x2F;Mexico border right about Texas&#x2F;Coahuila region. Navigating that dessert region without GPS or with GPS for that matter can be deadly.\n\n    That&#x27;s the most curious jamming I see on the map—anybody know why jamming is present there? Is there a military base in that region?\n\n      U.S. military has some Very Secret Stuff happening in certain desert areas.\n\n      Laughlin air force base is there.\n\n      Probably because it&#x27;s pilot training bases and the maneuvers they perform tend to throw off the ADS-B due to signal issues.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpsworld.com&#x2F;one-gps-mystery-solved-another-remains&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpsworld.com&#x2F;one-gps-mystery-solved-another-rema...</a>\n\n    Organized crime in Mexico would probably do it to prevent other people from using migration routes they control and reduce police efficacy. Of course, slightly rogue Mexican police or even US vigilantes also have an incentive.\n\n    If you line it up with that big lake, you can see there&#x27;s an Air Force base right nearby<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@29.3385589,-100.8055747,12.72z?entry=ttu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@29.3385589,-100.8055747,12.72z?...</a>\n\n  The Eastern Mediterranean might be the (significant, underreported, under-remembered) Russian military presence in Syria. They have airbases, a naval base, they rotate and train their officers there, they constantly ship military equipment back and forth from the Black Sea ports via the Bosphorus to Syria, they train the Syrian army, they build human shield observation posts overlooking Israel.<p>What&#x27;s unfathomable to me is how Israel (or Netanyahu?) keeps treating them as a frenemy.\n\n    I think there are probably many parties contributing to the interference in the Eastern Mediterrarnean. Russia and Israel are two of the big ones right now (and both have admitted doing it).<p>See this report by C4ADS from 2019, about Russian jamming: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c4ads.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;above-us-only-stars&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c4ads.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;above-us-only-stars&#x2F;</a><p>Map of Israeli GPS spoofing (which is distinct from jamming, and we haven&#x27;t talked much about in this discussion): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lemonodor&#x2F;status&#x2F;1717987479255720076\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lemonodor&#x2F;status&#x2F;1717987479255720076</a>\n\n  I want to know more about the White Sea Canal&#x2F;Lake Onega patch and the spot in West Papua\n\n    The Papua one is weird.

The NIC value informs how certain the aircraft is of its position by providing a radius of uncertainty.<p>&gt; Poor NIC values alone might indicate a problem with an aircraft’s equipment or unfavorable positioning. However, when observed in multiple aircraft in close proximity during the same time frame, it suggests the presence of a radio signal interfering with normal GNSS operation.<p>A single observer can&#x27;t really say for certain that jamming is happening; you need a distributed sample from multiple different sensors over a period of time to have reasonably high confidence.\n\n  &gt; A single observer can&#x27;t really say for certain that jamming is happening; you need a distributed sample from multiple different sensors over a period of time to have reasonably high confidence.<p>Could you use RTLSDR triangulation to hone in on granular lat long of jamming sources?<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtl-sdr.com&#x2F;detecting-gps-jammers-in-augmented-reality&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtl-sdr.com&#x2F;detecting-gps-jammers-in-augmented-r...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtl-sdr.com&#x2F;kiwisdr-tdoa-direction-finding-now-freely-available-for-public-use&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtl-sdr.com&#x2F;kiwisdr-tdoa-direction-finding-now-f...</a>\n\n    You can get rough areas with a GPS and a RTLSDR and a bunch of samples (either over time OR with lots of people with the same device)<p>But to get fine granular data, you need a timestamping SDR. (each parcel of signal data for a quantum of data needs an exact time down to 6-8 significant figures, basically GPS timebase).<p>Most your cheaper SDRs cant do that.<p>Stuff like the BladeRF and higher do provide timestamped data.\n\n    With synchronized receivers you could do some rudimentary direction finding. Note that synchronizing SDRs is much more achievable if they&#x27;re physically nearby (e.g. can run a cable between them for a common clock) vs if they&#x27;re physically distant observers (can&#x27;t exactly use GPS time for synchronization if you&#x27;re measuring GPS interference)\n\n      Very helpful (as well as sibling comment by pierat). Thank you both. I will need to do some research with regards to pairing SDRs with local disciplined clock that can tolerate temporary loss of remote (stratum-0,1) time precision.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GPS_disciplined_oscillator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GPS_disciplined_oscillator</a>\n\n      &gt; can&#x27;t exactly use GPS time for synchronization if you&#x27;re measuring GPS interference<p>Can other GNSSes (Galileo&#x2F;BeiDou&#x2F;GLONASS&#x2F;etc) give usable timestamps? Seems like it&#x27;d be tricky for a jammer to target all of them simultaneously. (Of course, since they&#x27;d be on a different band, unless your SDR is wideband enough you&#x27;d need two RX heads which gives you potential issues with phase drift between the tuning VCOs even if your <i>sampling</i> is coherent).<p>Perhaps a sufficiently directional antenna&#x2F;phased array (for getting an actual satellite signal) as well as an omnidirectional one (for picking up the jamming signal) could get you somewhere...<p>Or perhaps one could look at computing AoA at each receiver site (using MIMO-y techniques, e.g. Kraken&#x2F;KerberosSDR) and triangulating based on angles instead, which wouldn&#x27;t require synchronizing physically-distant sites at all...<p>The problem definitely seems soluble, though I don&#x27;t have the technical background to know how realistic that is.\n\n        &gt;&gt; Can other GNSS give usable timestamps? Seems like it&#x27;d be tricky for a jammer to target all of them<p>Actually the opposite; GNSS systems are all purposely designed to operate at virtually the same frequency (check out this figure [1]) while cleverly not interfering with each other. There are sub-bands within each constellation too (L1,L2,L5 etc) but it&#x27;s very easy to pump out wideband noise across all the GNSS bands.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;The-spectrum-of-current-GNSS-signals-in-15-17-GHz_fig1_259435730\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;The-spectrum-of-current-...</a>\n\n    KrakenSDR would do a good job of this, they combine five RTLSDR into a coherent array. The top end of their tuning range is 1766 MHz which would include the 1575 MHz of the GPS L1 signal.<p>The little five antenna array can even attach on the roof of a car for a handy ground plane. Prob not a good idea to drive with it out there tho.\n\n    You could also use a single receiver with a small antenna array (GPS wavelength is around 20 cm) to estimate the angle of arrival of the incoming signals.\n\n  Do aircraft systems really only use GPS and not the full constellation of navigational satellite systems?<p><i>Besides GPS, the GNSS currently includes other satellite navigation systems, such as the Russian GLONASS, and may soon include others such as the European Union’s Galileo and China’s Beidou.</i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terrisgps.com&#x2F;gnss-gps-differences-explained&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terrisgps.com&#x2F;gnss-gps-differences-explained&#x2F;</a>\n\n    The linked page already says that it reports on the constellation, not just GPS:<p>&quot;The map uses are color coded overlay to indicate low (green) to high (red) levels of interference with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Often just referred to as GPS, there are actually multiple systems beside the US GPS constellation, such as Russia’s GLONASS, Europe’s Galileo, China’s BeiDou, and others.&quot;\n\n      Just came here to wonder who came up with the beautiful name of CLOWNASS... er, I mean GLONASS.\n\n        GLObalnaya NAvigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema in Russian.\n\n    Like the article states, many people use GPS as a shorthand for GNSS generally. In any case, they&#x27;re all at similar frequencies, so typically they&#x27;ll all go out together if there&#x27;s significant interference.\n\n      GLONASS notoriously uses its own band and data format, while following the same basic working principle.\n\n    It doesn&#x27;t matter too much, aircraft don&#x27;t rely solely on any GNSS for navigation, because they&#x27;re all susceptible to similar availability issues.  Magnetic, inertial, barometric, and land-based radio systems are also used.  One or more of those other systems are used as a fallback when GNSS fails.\n\n    They use full constellation, in addition to Inertial Nav (INS) -- at least in the US military.\n\n    Modern phones use all the available navigation constellations, and have done so for years.<p>But aviation is much more conservative due to its safety-critical nature. Galileo was only just recently (2023) certified for use in aircraft systems by ICAO:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.esa.int&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Navigation&#x2F;Galileo&#x2F;Galileo_now_fit_for_aviation#\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.esa.int&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Navigation&#x2F;Galileo&#x2F;Galileo_...</a>\n\n      In the specific case of jamming, it seems unlikely anyone would jam GPS and not <i>also</i> jam the other public GNSS services.<p>The redundancy of multiple independent GNSS systems is a fine thing for dealing with unintentional failures, of course.\n\n    &gt; may soon include others such as (...)<p>Just for the record, this must have been written ages ago.

Jamming is an act by humans to <i>intentionally</i> disrupt the GPS signal.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sapt.faa.gov&#x2F;outages.php?outageType=129001450&amp;outageResolution=0.5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sapt.faa.gov&#x2F;outages.php?outageType=129001450&amp;outage...</a>\n\n    And I think the above commenter&#x27;s point is that ADS-B data does not indicate intentionality.\n\n      Could be. I was directly answering &quot;what&#x27;s the difference?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to know intentionality without also knowing where there is expected+natural interference. Of course, when a region is surrounded by persistent GNSS issues and is a known war-zone with large actors, intentionality is fairly reasonably assumed.\n\n  The GPS jamming map linked to in the article[1] discusses this somewhat, in the &quot;About the data&quot; box:<p><pre><code>    - ADS-B messages include position information from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), like GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BeiDou, etc.\n    - It is not possible to directly measure GNSS interference, but we do calculate the NIC (Navigation integrity category) for ADS-B messages.\n    - The NIC value encodes the quality and consistency of navigational data received by the aircraft.\n    - Poor NIC values alone might indicate a problem with an aircraft’s equipment or unfavorable positioning.

Those cells you find so suspicious in Australia are not there on other days !<p>That kind of disproves the &quot;no data&quot; hypothesis though, no?<p>One explanation could be they have a simplistic algorithm like &quot;if uncertainty &gt; (something indicating more than 5 minutes of GNSS-to-INS fallback) on more than 50% of all flights of a day&quot;, and there&#x27;s only one flight per day in that region.<p>&gt; Seriously, given the largely community-based nature of FR24 data I would not expect too much in term of accuracy.<p>Flightradar24 data is accurate enough for some commercial entities to rely on it. Also, in case of a lack of ADS-B receiver data we&#x27;d also expect a grey square, not a red one, right?\n\n              I thought it might have been Square Kilometer Array interference but that&#x27;s to the north of those spots.\n\n            If green or &quot;no data&quot; areas randomly turn red sometimes, I&#x27;d expect to see them elsewhere in the world sometimes on different days as well.

In remote western Aus we see a few red cells to the west of a large area of empty cells. So they do have ADS-B receivers there, and at least some of them are reporting a troublesome NIC, and there are enough reports for FR24 to place a colored cell there rather than an empty cell. Why exactly do you think that a red cell comes from no data or very limited data, when the article does not indicate that no data &#x2F; limited data results in a red cell?\n\n  Grey areas: Few people live there and none have set up a public ADS receiver.

Likewise, I would guess that the strip of interference from St Petersburg in the direction of Moscow is a similar single-layer of defence by Russia.<p>At this resolution, it also looks like the west is interfering with access to St Petersburg and <i>someone</i> (could reasonably be either side) is worried about Kaliningrad, but that image is also also making me think &quot;WTF?&quot; about the Gulf of Riga.<p>The single tile near Kandalaksha (Russia) suggests <i>something</i> interesting is going on there, but I have no idea what that might be, and there&#x27;s a non-zero possibility that it&#x27;s a deliberate red-herring to make western analysts waste time — as an analogy, imagine a troll releasing three greased pigs with the numbers &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;4&quot; painted on the side.\n\nThis is suspiciously similar to `gpsjam.org`. It&#x27;s useful, for sure, and it does use readily-available ADS-B data that FR24 (and ADSBExchange) uses anyway, but the data viz is just eerily similar.<p>Then again, I&#x27;m not very GIS&#x2F;geodesy minded, so maybe hexagons are the best shape that&#x27;ll tessellate over a sphere easily.<p>Was this work in any meaningful way inspired by GPSjam?

Or is the jamming signal so many orders of magnitudes stronger than the satellites that there&#x27;s always going to be some gain no matter how good the shield is?<p>Ok it exists, but shielding is (only) about 20dB looking downwards, which may not be enough: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safran-navigation-timing.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;8230aj-gps-gnss-anti-jam-outdoor-antenna&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safran-navigation-timing.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;8230aj-gps-gnss...</a>\n\n  I thought GPS signals from space were incredibly weak. Limited power budget + 100km in the sky. Seems trivial for a ground based system to crank up the watts to whatever arbitrary limit they desire.\n\n    True, signal per satellite is only around 150-160dBW on earth despite them radiating at 25W. Satellites are ~20000km away. If a jammer is 100 times closer (200km), they need to use only 1&#x2F;10,000 (1&#x2F;100^2) the power, so it&#x27;s very easy to jam sadly.\n\n  Two issues to consider:<p>- GPS positioning is more accurate if the satellites it sees come from a variety of angles (GDOP), so the satellites near the horizon are valuable.<p>- Aircraft pitch and roll, so a fixed antenna like this would lose precision as it turns to make an approach - just about the worst possible time.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to make an antenna with a sharp cutoff to limit the ground vs. above-ground.  So, most anti-jammers will use beamforming to cancel out interference in one or more specific directions. So, the null in the antenna moves to follow the interference.<p>GDOP: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dilution_of_precision_(navigation)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dilution_of_precision_(navigat...</a>\n\nIt would be a lot more useful if country contours were drawn too like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;</a> does.\n\nDoes anyone know if the how the ADS-B uncertainty measurements interact with GPS spoofing? Often when you look at these maps you see a donut around Kaliningrad - could it be that there&#x27;s wide area jamming, and then localized spoofing more directly around Kaliningrad?\n\nI&#x27;m a little surprised that Shenzhen doesn&#x27;t seem to be churning out ITAR-busting anti-jamming systems. The tech is pretty old by now and the market is there.\n\nI&#x27;m disappointed in Jamaica I thought they&#x27;d be jammin for sure.\n\n  Well played.\n\nI love this feature, especially how they were able to create it from data that they were already getting, but personally my excitement about it is overshadowed by how colorblind unfriendly it is. Considering how many people are colorblind, ~4% of the global population, or roughly 1 out of 25 people, it&#x27;s remarkable how often designers get this detail wrong.\n\n  macOS and iOS have systemwide settings for color blind people. You can remap colors.\n\n    Yeah, I love that feature. It&#x27;s really not helping here though.\n\nIf anyone found the above interesting, I wrote a short article mapping plane activity on FlightRadar&#x27;s &#x27;blocked&#x27; list (i.e FlightRadar had agreed to remove the ADBS data from their dataset following probable legal pressure).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dfworks.xyz&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hnwi-osint-private-jet&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dfworks.xyz&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hnwi-osint-private-jet&#x2F;</a><p>Slightly tangential so feel free to remove if irrelevant\n\n  The article was interesting alone, simply for the Google Dork technique explanation.

However, isn&#x27;t Russians jamming common signals in other states&#x27; territory an act of war?\n\nCurious about the other areas than near Russia where jamming seems to occur: Myanmar and Kashmir(?)\n\n  In Myanmar, since the 2021 Military coup, there have been conflicts and wars between the military forces vs anti-junta ethnic armed organisations<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myanmar-now.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myanmar-now.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rfo_5Cnf4A0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rfo_5Cnf4A0</a>\n\nIs that Perth with a great big red blob as well?<p>I don’t think I am misreading the map - what on earth is that? \nAre the sheep rebelling and have some decent anti-aircraft tech?\n\n  I was thinking that could be the CIA base in Pine Gap, but that seems like it&#x27;s more in the center of the country\n\nWhat if this Russian jamming crap causes another major loss of life like MH17? We really have to do something about this.\n\n  Airplanes don&#x27;t need GPS to fly. Jamming GPS won&#x27;t cause any crashes.\n\n    We&#x27;re actually replacing a lot of VORs for GPS nav and GPS approaches are also a thing.\n\n    GPS jamming is already thought to have caused one drone accident, with fatality: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemondronor.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2013&#x2F;3&#x2F;gps-loss-kicked-off-fatal-drone-crash\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemondronor.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2013&#x2F;3&#x2F;gps-loss-kicked...</a><p>And there have been several close calls already, with passenger jets: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;faa-files-reveal-a-surprising-threat-to-airline-safety-the-us-militarys-gps-tests\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;faa-files-reveal-a-surprising-thre...</a><p>Planes don&#x27;t need radar, transponders, or even radio to fly, but they&#x27;re all very important for safety.\n\n      Yeah exactly, like that second article says, suddenly having to switch to a pretty archaic system that&#x27;s now only used for backup (with a reduced number of VORs) is not fun, and the distraction can lead to build up of other situations that can really cause serious danger. It won&#x27;t be the single cause of a crash, but crashes are rarely the cause of a single problem but rather a compound failure of many things going wrong in just the worst way.<p>Here in Europe VORs are also very rare now. Makes sense because they&#x27;re hugely expensive to operate and when used only for backup it&#x27;s not a very good investment.\n\n  The US has laws against interfering with GPS, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any global laws about GPS jamming, you&#x27;d need something from the UN but it doesn&#x27;t seem like most countries would want to give up that ability - we can&#x27;t even get people to stop making nukes and they have a much higher danger\n\nI find it interesting how far into Poland Russia can jam GPS. I assume this is done from Belarus?<p>What is the max range I wonder? Probably same as radar? How much power does it take?\n\n  More likely it is from around Kaliningrad\n\nInteresting - as I&#x27;m in the middle of one of the red blobs on the map and just used my phone with google maps to drive around. It worked fine. All the local services that rely on positioning via phones seemed to work fine as well.<p>I wonder how the jamming works - is it just for higher altitudes or maybe it only affects GPS and my phone also uses GLONASS or something?\n\n  On your phone the GPS is just one input to determine its position. It&#x27;s most likely also triangulating cell phone towers. Get an app that only shows GPS data and check if you see coordinates jumping around.\n\n  Google maps (and your phone&#x27;s location services) seldom rely only on GPS.<p>For one, accelerometer-based location has become pretty good. You can usually get by for a few kilometers on the average road.<p>For two, Google maps is aware that you are driving, and this it sticks to roads, especially ones that are on your itinerary, because of your GPS registers as the middle of a field, it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;re experiencing GPS issues rather than you driving at 130km&#x2F;h in a potato field.<p>Finally, location services are amplified by nearby wifi signals, mapped by google with street view. Your phone can say &quot;here is the Mac address of every wifi network I can see and a rough estimate of my position&quot; and Google&#x27;s services can very accurately triangulate where you are.\n\n    Does accelerometer-based location algorithm integrate the acceleration readings to get the phone displacement? Is it a part of the phone operating systems ?\n\n      It tries. Accelerometer-based positioning is best used with camera displacement, which isn&#x27;t used in Google maps driving mode (though there was? Is? An experimental on-foot mode that showed directions in AR).<p>the accel-based positioning I&#x27;m pretty sure is implemented app-side, not os-side, but I could be mistaken.\n\n      Probably not. Maybe to like know where you are turning in a round about. But the drift is too big to be useful over any distance.\n\n  Aircraft fly higher, which means they pick up ground radio signals from much further away - both good (ATC communication, ground-based navigation beacons) and bad (intentional jamming).<p>On the ground, the radio horizon is about 20-40 miles. In the air, the radio horizon is about 200-400 miles.\n\nMost of these GPS-jammed zones are, obviously, near areas of active conflicts (Ukraine, Myanmar, Isreal&#x2F;Palestine, Kashmir, etc).<p>But what&#x27;s going on in Western Australia? And South-west Texas?\n\n  Western Australia could be the ongoing emu war - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emu_War\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emu_War</a>\n\n  That spot in western Australia is interesting, I was looking at that earlier. My map doesn&#x27;t show any indication of interference there, in fact from what I can tell there&#x27;s plenty of evidence of _no_ interference. Eh, there are sometimes analysis or other artifacts, and it can be tricky to try to infer too much from one hex.\n\n  I crosschecked with google Maps and I belive the Jindalee Operational Radar Network in Laverton is stationed there. Maybe that has something to with the interference. A 560kw transmitter is no joke.<p>I guess south-west Texas is most likely also military. E.g. the Naval Air Station Kingsville is not far away.\n\n    Huh I had no idea Australia had a big OTH radar network. TIL!\n\n  According to this study (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;group&#x2F;scpnt&#x2F;gpslab&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Liu_ION_ITM_2023_ADSB.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;group&#x2F;scpnt&#x2F;gpslab&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Liu_...</a>), the Texas spot is the US Military doing aerobatics training, causing the training aircraft to repeatedly report signal loss.<p>My guess is that the spots in Western Australia are the same thing, given the nearby RAAF training bases.\n\n  WA may be the radio quiet zone: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.industry.gov.au&#x2F;science-technology-and-innovation&#x2F;space-and-astronomy&#x2F;ska-project-australia&#x2F;australian-radio-quiet-zone-wa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.industry.gov.au&#x2F;science-technology-and-innovatio...</a>\n\n    That was my guess too. Apparently Starlink satellites go quiet over the area too but there is still some detectable EMF.\n\nI&#x27;ve been working on mapping GPS jamming using ADS-B data for a couple\nyears, and I&#x27;ll try to address questions and points brought up here\nbased on what I know.<p>Relevant previous posts on HN:<p>2022: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32245346\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32245346</a><p>2023: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37868106\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37868106</a><p>(From my comment on that 2023 post: &quot;Why haven&#x27;t FlightRadar24,\nFlightAware, or any of the other flight trackers done this?&quot;)<p>&quot;A single observer can&#x27;t really say for certain that jamming is\nhappening; you need a distributed sample from multiple different\nsensors over a period of time to have reasonably high confidence.&quot;<p>There are heuristics you can use that allow you to make a pretty good\nguess about whether jamming is happening based on signals from just\none or two aircraft, and have worked well on GPSJAM for the past\ncouple years.<p>With regard to localization of GPS jammers, yes you can do direction\nfinding of the emitted signal directly, but that&#x27;s easy mode.

I assume as multi-network systems become more\nand more common jammers will just target all of them, if they&#x27;re not\nalready.<p>&quot;There looks like a big hole of no data over Ukraine, where I&#x27;d most\nexpect GPS jamming, but I suppose there are no civilian flights\neither. Maybe they could setup an GPS observation station on the\nground at a surveyed point to get data there.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s right, no (or few) flights over Ukraine with ADS-B transponders\nmeans no data. I actually first started mapping GPS jamming on\nFeb. 14, 2022\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;?lat=45.00000&amp;lon=35.00000&amp;z=3.0&amp;date=2022-02-14\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;?lat=45.00000&amp;lon=35.00000&amp;z=3.0&amp;date=202...</a>),\nbecause I thought it might give me an early warning of the expected\nRussian invasion of Ukraine. It didn&#x27;t work out that way--there was no\nindication of interference right up until Feb 24., and then all civil\naviation stopped and there was no more data for that region\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;?lat=49.18928&amp;lon=33.51687&amp;z=3.9&amp;date=2022-02-24\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;?lat=49.18928&amp;lon=33.51687&amp;z=3.9&amp;date=202...</a>).<p>As some of you have noticed, GPS jamming is highly correlated with\nconflict zones. Some conflicts are higher intensity than others--for\nexample, I think the airspace around Cyprus has been jammed for years\n(since 2018 maybe?), and I get the feeling it&#x27;s more harrassment than\nanything else (maybe someone more geopolitically savvy than me knows\nmore).<p>&quot;I see 2 red cells on the US&#x2F;Mexico border right about Texas&#x2F;Coahuila\nregion&quot;. Someone always says it&#x27;s cartels, and the evidence is that\nit&#x27;s much more likely to be U.S. military testing and training.

(I&#x27;m not even going to try to catalog\nacademic or government efforts, though I will mention HawkEye 360&#x27;s\nsatellite based GPS interference mapping:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacenews.com&#x2F;hawkeye-360-gps-ukr&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacenews.com&#x2F;hawkeye-360-gps-ukr&#x2F;</a>)<p>&quot;If line of sight to the jamming antenna is required to be jammed, why\ndo aircraft not have a downwards shield so that they only receive GPS\nsignal from the sky (satellites) and not from jammers (coming from the\nbottom hemisphere)? Or is the jamming signal so many orders of\nmagnitudes stronger than the satellites that there&#x27;s always going to\nbe some gain no matter how good the shield is?&quot;<p>Yes, GPS signals are so weak (below the noise floor!) that it&#x27;s just\nsuper easy to overpower them with terrestrial (or airborne)\njammers. But there are special antennas and other techniques for\nbuilding jam-resistant systems, e.g. &quot;controlled reception pattern\nantennas&quot; (CRPA):\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpsworld.com&#x2F;anti-jam-technology-demystifying-the-crpa&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpsworld.com&#x2F;anti-jam-technology-demystifying-th...</a>\nBut I think the main reason most civilian aircraft systems aren&#x27;t jam\nresistant is because they didn&#x27;t need to be--For the past several\ndecades GPS jamming has been a much smaller issue than it is now, and\nI don&#x27;t think there was sufficient reason to spend time and money on\nwhat would have been an over-engineered, mostly unnecessary\nsystem. But the situation is changing, and I expect anti-jamming to\nbecome a more significant concern by equipment manufacturers and\naviation authorities.<p>[Edited to add:]<p>&quot;I&#x27;m in the middle of one of the red blobs on the map and just used my\nphone with google maps to drive around. It worked fine.&quot;<p>From the GPSJAM FAQ: &quot;&quot;I live in one of the red zones and my GPS was\nfine?&quot;&quot;\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#i-live-in-one-of-the-red-zones\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#i-live-in-one-of-the-red-zones</a>). Yeah, the\nanswer is, as you mentioned, aircraft fly at higher altitudes, so they\nget much longer line of sight to the jammer.<p>On the general idea of using ADS-B to map GPS interference, when I\nthought of this idea I was pretty excited. I realized that if you had\naccess to worldwide ADS-B data, which ADS-B Exchange graciously gave\nme as part of my Advisory Circular project\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24188661\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24188661</a>), you could also make a\nworldwide map of GPS jamming, and I hadn&#x27;t seen anyone do that before\n(later I found some researchers who realized you could get GPS jamming\ninformation from ADS-B, but they only looked at a couple\naircraft).<p>I just think it&#x27;s pretty neat that even though there were multiple\ncompanies devoted to processing, analyzing, and selling ADS-B data,\nand ADS-B data is not all that complicated, none of those companies\nhad realized this new way of using it. Sometimes there&#x27;s gold left\neven in data that you think must have been completely mined out.<p>Even specifically looking at ADS-B data as it relates to GPS\ninterference, there&#x27;s still lots to be done! FR24 is mapping jamming,\nbut I don&#x27;t think anyone else has made worldwide maps of spoofing\n(yet!): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lemonodor&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770515361739493488\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lemonodor&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770515361739493488</a><p>[Edited to add more:]<p>With respect to safety issues, yes, aircraft have redundant navigation\nsystems. But GPS is one of the important layers that add safety to\naviation, and it is not at all normal for entire countries or even\nlarger regions to lsoe GPS while still maintaining passenger\nflights. This Eurocontrol presentation, &quot;GNSS Interference and Civil\nAviation&quot;, has lots of details:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rntfnd.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;Aviation-GNSS-interference-UN-ICG-WGS-IDM-ECTL-GNSS-RFI-SEP23.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rntfnd.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;Aviation-GNSS-interfer...</a><p>From the presentation:<p><pre><code>  Aviation Safety is built on two main principles:\n    • Trust your instruments\n    • Follow standard operating procedure\n  GNSS RFI causes pilots to have to question both principles!\n</code></pre>\nThere have been close calls due to lack of GPS. It increases workload\nfor both pilots and controllers, which is a safety issue by\nitself. Despite a lot of airlines and government aviation agencies\nsaying everything is fine, they&#x27;re not really prepared for a world\nwith frequent GPS denial, and everything is not fine. Industry and\ngovernment are organizing emergency meetings about how to handle this\nin a less ad hoc way than they have been so far (commercial aviation\nis kind of the opposite of ad hoc).\n\n  I&#x27;m not a NATO strategist or anything, so I&#x27;m adding this as a child comment, but I think the big story in the GPS&#x2F;aviation world these days is probably Russia&#x27;s n̵e̵a̵r̵-̵c̵o̵n̵s̵t̵a̵n̵t̵ frequent jamming of GPS over Poland, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, and Lithuania. Degrading and even neutralizing strategic infrastructure in EU and NATO countries, significantly affecting commercial aviation at the least, is a big deal. There&#x27;s some reluctance to say it&#x27;s Russia doing the jamming, though that seems to be the consensus among experts. I assume governments know with 100% confidence who it is.\n\n    OSINT by Markus Jonsson (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;auonsson?s=21&amp;t=L_vyKMe6Kz1tXjeWTeGk3g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;auonsson?s=21&amp;t=L_vyKMe6Kz1tXjeWTeGk3g</a>) has been tracking this for some time now.\n\n    &gt;&quot;There&#x27;s some reluctance to say it&#x27;s Russia doing the jamming, though that seems to be the consensus among experts.&quot;<p>Why the reluctance? I do not think there is much love lost in regards to Russia.\n\n      Well, if you identify them then you might have to do something about it. But it&#x27;s not clear there&#x27;s much to be done. Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to deny or just not mention that someone is acting in a hostile way. The example I often think of is Iran firing missiles at U.S. warships during Operation Praying Mantis, and then, as Wikipedia puts it: &quot;The Pentagon and the Reagan Administration later denied that any Silkworm missile attacks took place, possibly in order to keep the situation from escalating further - as they had promised publicly that any such attacks would merit retaliation against targets on Iranian soil.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Praying_Mantis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Praying_Mantis</a>\n\n        The situation with Russia is well past escalation by accusation of civil aircraft jamming. After all, they&#x27;ve pretty much stolen all planes they had under lease from Western owners.<p>Appeasement of someone like Putin is always a mistake.<p>So far every time the West calls his bluff he cowardly pretends nothing happened, be it HIMARS, Storm Shadow and HARM missile shipments, tank shipments, AWACS support, you name it.<p>He only attacked Ukraine because he hoped to win in a week, and this wouldn&#x27;t have happened if the West armed Ukraine earlier. The desire not to escalate with Putin cost Europe a war.\n\n          every few weeks they&#x27;re threttening to nuke some country, i think there&#x27;s nothing that can be called excalation at this point (except the obvious idea to retaliate with guns, but that&#x27;s a very bad idea).\n\n            Can you provide sources where they actually threaten to nuke anyone out of the blue (excluding Medvedev, he’s especially nuts)? All I can find is them clarifying their nuclear policy when pressed about it (would only use in situation of existential threat). Which seems less bellicose than US policy (as the US changed ours not long ago, seemingly allowing for first strike which is pretty insane): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armscontrol.org&#x2F;act&#x2F;2022-12&#x2F;focus&#x2F;bidens-disappointing-nuclear-posture-review\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armscontrol.org&#x2F;act&#x2F;2022-12&#x2F;focus&#x2F;bidens-disappo...</a>\n\n              Then you remember they called Ukraine in NATO an existential threat, and wiped their butts with international treaties that were supposed to be much more set in stone than some half-official nuclear doctrine.<p>However, this is all playing chicken. Whenever they were facing actual opposition, they backed down.\n\n                Which threats and treaties, specifically? I don&#x27;t have a great memory - so please share actual sources.<p>Also, are you aware of this?: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armscontrol.org&#x2F;act&#x2F;2019-09&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-completes-inf-treaty-withdrawal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armscontrol.org&#x2F;act&#x2F;2019-09&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-completes-in...</a>\n\n                  For some speculative context: this is because of the &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; as the US does not have a strategic arms reduction treaty with China and is not intended to escalate the arms race with Russia (although that might be a side-effect).\n\n                  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Budapest_Memorandum\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Budapest_Memorandum</a><p>As for INF, US withdrawal was a response to Russia testing infringing missiles first.\n\n                    Maybe, but US pulled out first:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;691521600&#x2F;russia-pulls-out-of-inf-treaty-in-response-to-u-s-move\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;691521600&#x2F;russia-pulls-out-of...</a>\n\n                      Pulling out of treaty is not as treacherous as claiming obeying the treaty, and not obeying it.\n\n                  Here are a few.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ukrinform.net&#x2F;rubric-polytics&#x2F;3503924-president-zelensky-russia-violated-about-400-international-treaties-since-2014.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ukrinform.net&#x2F;rubric-polytics&#x2F;3503924-president-...</a>\n\n                    That is not an unbiased primary source in the slightest.\n\n                      Is BFMTV also biased when reporting words directly from the mouth of Piotr Tolstoi or are you just trolling ?\n\n                        If people are claiming that a country is threatening nuclear war, they damn well better be able to back it up with something more than narrative-shaping sound bytes.\n\n                  Here&#x27;s one.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Budapest_Memorandum\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Budapest_Memorandum</a>\n\n              Medvedev is chairman of the Russian security council though, who else would be more qualified for dishing out the weekly nuclear threat?\n\n                Which weekly nuclear threat?<p>Sensational out of context drive by sound bytes from the likes of Guardian, Fox News, Twitter and video gammer subreddits are not sources - they’re click bait.\n\n                  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JuliaDavisNews\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JuliaDavisNews</a><p>Months and months of this nonsense now.<p>Do you really think Solovyov and Simonyan are broadcasting it without official approval?\n\n                    I literally just wrote Twitter is not news.

Anything from ISW is not neutral, it’s ideological due to the Nuland-Kagan connection: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;F1kjvOsXwAA1tVk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;F1kjvOsXwAA1tVk.jpg</a>\n\n              You mean like Piotr Tolstoi talking about nuking Paris on BFMTV just today ?

A few years ago he promised russia &quot;devastating consequences if Navalny dies in prison&quot;. So Navalny did die in prison. What did Biden do? Right.\n\n          Yup. Promises and talking big works up until someone calls the bluff.<p>NATO in a certain way is based on that as well. If it fails a single test regarding article 5 after someone challenges it, it becomes instantly worthless.<p>The danger as I see it currently is that the West is tired of war and it’s an opportunity for Putin to challenge NATO. Attack a small village in a Baltic state. Are Americans and Germans and the British going to risk their lives for a small village in a Baltic country? I hope they would, but I realistically don’t see it. And that one non-response would make NATO worth less than the paper the agreement was printed on.\n\n      Sticking to the truth &amp; what you really know,  and not scape goating?\n\n    Does this affect everyone there? Google maps on people&#x27;s phones etc?\n\n      No, not unless you&#x27;re really close to the jammer. If you&#x27;re on the ground the horizon is typically a lot closer than the jammer is (it&#x27;s speculated that Kaliningrad is the location of at least some of the jammers affecting the Baltic), so you don&#x27;t have line of sight to it and you&#x27;re not affected. Aircraft are flying way up where they _do_ have line of sight to the jammer, so their receivers are impacted.\n\n    It should be a big story, as should be the fact that Russia invaded a peaceful neighboring country and keeps murdering, raping and torturing its residents.<p>But somehow much of the world pretends not to notice and only does whatever is convenient at the moment (buy Russian oil&#x2F;gas, do business in Russia, stay &quot;neutral&quot;, etc). I find it incredibly depressing, I thought that surely in the 2020s our civilization would have progressed further.<p>Russia will play the slowly boiled frog game to their advantage — GPS jamming is just the beginning. We will likely soon see further small incursions, each one ever so slightly larger than the previous one. And we&#x27;ll hear Mr Scholz say something about doing something, but we won&#x27;t see him actually do anything. Mr Macron will use grand words and do nothing as well. Austria will &quot;declare neutrality&quot; (easy to do when you have other countries as buffers from the aggressor).<p>As someone currently living in the EU close to Ukraine, I find all this very sad.\n\n      I find it rather sad too, especially the US politics at the moment where it seems one man basically can block the political system and let Putin win.\n\n      There are plenty of Russian apologists in the US as well, unfortunately\n\n        Check out the arguments made by John Mearshimer. His heart breaks for the Ukrainian people but he is focused on US policy missteps (because he is American and lives in the US) as the root cause of the problem.\n\n          No offense to you but that man’s argument has strong “I beat my wife because she deserves it” vibes.<p>The US has made more than its fair share of policy missteps. But to try and argue that the actions of the US somehow “forced” Russia to invade its neighbor and former satellite state to rid it of “nazis” (Putin’s quote not mine) is absurd.\n\n            &gt; “I beat my wife because she deserves it” vibes.<p>Hmm. I think there is not much point in discussing\n\n          Check out this analysis of Mr. Mearsheimer&#x27;s arguments:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wE-t2ePFEDc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wE-t2ePFEDc</a>\n\n      The news is not able to keep maintaining the level of outrage at the war. They don&#x27;t even try in a lot of cases because I think deep down people don&#x27;t care.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean people don&#x27;t care about the people though. Human suffering is always bad.\n\n  Who is jamming around Tallinn area? Also is GPSIII just as susceptible to jamming?<p>Hawkeye + SAR data would be pretty interesting for ship tracking. I think I&#x27;ve seen some papers here before, but nothing interactive like your site. I think open SAR data is not quite realtime yet, but hope soon is.\n\n    Search and Rescue data? How does that help here? And is there a repository of SAR rescues somewhere?\n\n      Think it&#x27;s Synthetic Aperture RADAR.\n\n        Thank you, wasn’t aware of this. Learned something today!\n\n  John, I&#x27;ve been following your work for years (including back in the old lemonodor years). I just wanted to say thank you here, for sharing your expertise for all on this topic, and for all the other tremendous work you&#x27;ve done. What an inspiration.\n\n  &gt; but my understanding is that most aircraft are still using GPS.<p>GNSS, GPS plus other constellations depends on the receiver. Even drones or consumer ones support that these days, some bigger drones even support L5 bands.\n\n    Consumer GNSS devices are developed a lot quicker than aviation GPS receivers due to high cost and strict certification requirements.<p>So your 100 dollar drone very likely has a receiver with more features than a 100 million dollar airliner. And that drone is probably made recently, but airliners fly for 30 years.\n\n  &quot;Do aircraft systems really only use GPS&quot;<p>I know older long-range planes from the 70s and 80s had excellent inertial navigation systems.<p>Not quite as good as GPS, but good enough to know the location of the plane within a few nautical miles. The main problem is that inertial navigation systems drifted over time and required constant recalibration from the crew whenever they had a fix from real navigation beacons and errors could be catastrophic (especially when skirting the edge of Soviet airspace).<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered if modern avionics suites kept the older style inertial navigation systems as a backup to GPS, or if the systems were deleted when everyone switched to GPS.<p>I think it would be smart for larger planes to have a modern inertial navigation system that constantly recalibrated off GPS, ready to take over in the case of GPS jamming or spoofing.\n\n    They do that!  Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t always know when they&#x27;re being spoofed, so oops, your inertial reference system has just been infected by the spoofed location and now both nav systems are hosed.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ops.group&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gps-spoof-attacks-irs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ops.group&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gps-spoof-attacks-irs&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aerospace.honeywell.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;spoofing-and-jamming\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aerospace.honeywell.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;spoofin...</a>\n\n      Though shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to know if you are being spoofed. You probably have a decent idea of how much the IRS drifts and any large deviations from that or unexpected jumps in GPS should be noted and possibly, maybe manually, rolled-back so that the IRS only considers data before that point.<p>I understand that current civilian aircraft wasn&#x27;t designed with that in mind though.\n\n        Avionics were designed with the opposite assumption. When a high accuracy location source provides a location (GNSS or DME&#x2F;DME) the position is updated and it&#x27;s assumed that could mean a significant jump for the INS.<p>Practically that was what happened all the time before GPS. You would fly for a few hours over the ocean with no ground based reference, having a reasonable but not perfect INS location. Then get close to the coast where a DME&#x2F;DME fix was done which updated the INS position as a big jump of up to a few miles.<p>Filtering GPS updates that are too far &quot;off&quot; the INS state would be an almost opposite design to the original assumptions that DME and GNSS are highly accurate.\n\n        some amount of IRS drift should be ~predictable, an anticipated deviation from GPS could be used as a measure of trust for GPS\n\n      It seems like there’d be some use for something that correlates what it sees on the ground with known satellite imagery as a check? Especially for anything low-flying.\n\n    Based on discussions of some accidents, pilots often ignore inertial navigation systems at which they rarely look today, and sometimes forget to set the known good location before flights (which does not depend on GPS, as airports don&#x27;t move).\n\n      You can look at the INS position (and compare the position from each INS separately), but practically you&#x27;re always looking at the &quot;FMS position&quot; which is where the flight management computer thinks you are. That takes INS, GNSS&#x2F;GPS and other nav beacons into account. So it&#x27;s technically true that pilots don&#x27;t often look at the specific screen that has the INS position(s) on it, but you are looking at the FMS position which is basically equal to the INS position if GPS is not updating and you receive no ground signals.<p>Modern aircraft will also set the known position based on the runway you&#x27;re taking off from. And when airborne they&#x27;ll pick up a DME&#x2F;DME fix and update the location. So while it&#x27;s procedure to set the known starting location at the gate, there are also other sources.\n\n  &gt; As some of you have noticed, GPS jamming is highly correlated with conflict zones.<p>It might be sampling bias. More military aviation with erratic movement and also planes turning off and on their transmitters.<p>To measure GPS jamming, you should measure from a fixed object. Trying to do that with planes is unnecessary hard.\n\n    You can see a real-time display of aircraft that have possible GNSS interference at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?badgps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?badgps</a><p>If you look at that for a few seconds, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s almost entirely civilian passenger aircraft that are not making erratic movements, and that are near conflict zones.<p>Detecting GPS jamming with planes actually works a lot better than from a fixed terrestrial object, because 1. They have greater sensor range, 2. There are lots of them, 3. They move and cover lots of area, 4. they cover e.g. parts of the Black Sea where it would be more difficult to put a ground-based sensor.\n\n  I have lived in Kiev and I have seen how GPS jamming works on the ground. As soon as russian missiles or drones approached Kiev, our air defense typically turned on the GPS jamming. I could immediately see on my phone that I&#x27;m steadily moving in a straight line directly northeast at a high speed in a very different part of the city - all while sitting on the couch in my home not very high above the ground. A few times like that.<p>I was curious how powerful should a jammer be to completely actively substitute GPS coordinates in a city so large.\n\n  How is it possible to view the future?\nI can select March 2025 in the date field, are you a fortune teller?\n\nWhen I wait for relatives&#x2F;friends to land in Turkey, I always get a mini heart attack because either plane drifts like Fast and Furious or disappears completely from map and ask myself, is this real this time? Sometimes I have nightmares about it, I see the planes just falling down from the sky spontaneously because of the stress that GPS jamming induced to me over the years.\n\nNeed to get some more Helium hotspots proving location with proof of coverage and then people wouldn&#x27;t have to rely on government controlled GPS.\n\nWhat&#x27;s the deal with a large chunk of Turkey&#x27;s northern coast being jammed?\n\n- Sir! The radar, sir! It appears to be... jammed!<p>- \nThere&#x27;s only one man who would dare give me the raspberry: Lone Starr!\n\nI don&#x27;t know why, but watching flights in this app calms me down just like watching fire does.\n\nI just noticed that a lot of red spots correlate with bad weather, rain and thunderstorms.\n\nI&#x27;m strongly believe sooner or rather later GPS&#x2F;GNSS will be considered human right since the areas where their signals are mostly devoid of them are intentionally devoid by the prepetrators.<p>Currently I am working for a new wireless PHY technique that is more secure and robust against jamming, and also the first that able to propagate with limited non line of sight (NLoS). Hopefully soon we can overcome this anti human GPS&#x2F;GNSS jamming shenanigans.<p>For an excellent example for anti jamming secure wireless network for GPS (not my work) please check this thesis by Cara Yang Kataria [1]. She is currently working at the infamous MIT Lincoln Laboratory.<p>[1] Antenna-driven methods for increased wireless network security:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ideals.illinois.edu&#x2F;items&#x2F;115902\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ideals.illinois.edu&#x2F;items&#x2F;115902</a>\n\nNote the red near Pine Gap.\n\nThis reminds me of when I looked at Starlink&#x27;s coverage map ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starlink.com&#x2F;map\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starlink.com&#x2F;map</a> ) and at first I was super disappointed to see a big hole over WV, and I assumed it was political or some nonsense, but it&#x27;s not!<p>It&#x27;s the <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_National_Radio_Quiet_Zone\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_National_Radio_Q...</a><p>There will never be Starlink service there. Or cell service for that matter. There might not even be GPS now that I think about it. WiFi and microwaves are restricted too.\n\nThe map implementation is not great, what I miss most is country borders and labels.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpsjam.org</a> has come out first and is a much better design IMHO.\nFlightradar24 has _just_ the advantage of bigger sensors network and hence wider coverage."

LANL is one of the national labs, the one where the initial research on the atomic bomb was built, and some people there know the classified bits, but of course they won&#x27;t write a story for the public.<p>Ulam work on both bombs. But his name is more often associated with the H-bomb, he is considered one of its 2 fathers (the other being Teller, as in the &quot;Ulam-Teller&quot; design [1]).<p>So, was the Monte-Carlo method that he invented used for the H-bomb, or for the atomic bomb? After you read this blog post you have no idea.<p>I think the reason is that the Monte Carlo method that Ulam discovered was used for atomic bombs, but not for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki ones. It was used for the post war designs. The non-sexy truth is that the Monte Carlo method was not needed at all for the development of the A-bomb. And we don&#x27;t know if it was needed at all for the H-bomb, because that stuff is classified.<p>Why this article then?<p>I think it&#x27;s because LANL felt the need to honor Ulam somehow. Ulam was definitely an immense genius, one in the same class as Fermi, Bethe and Teller. But conveying exactly how he was a genius means you go into classified details. So, we end up with this vague generic praise. Too bad.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_Teller%E2%80%93Ulam_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_Teller%E2%80%93...</a>"
